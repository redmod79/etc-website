- ✓ E037 — PASS — Neutral: close paraphrase 2 Cor 5:1-4; both sides must acknowledge the tabernacle/clothed language and the desire not to be unclothed. Note in parenthetical correctly identifies the directional desire; this is what the text says.
- ⚠ E038 — ISSUE — Already reclassified to Neutral in the etc5-18 audit (noted in the file). The current classification listed in the table body is Neutral. PASS as currently recorded — but the statement text still contains an interpretive note that goes beyond what the verse says. See detail below.
- ⚠ E039 — ISSUE — Same situation as E038: already reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit. The statement includes interpretive parenthetical content that is inference, not explicit text. See detail below.
- ✓ E040 — PASS — Neutral: close paraphrase 1 Th 5:23; three-term observation both sides acknowledge.
- ✓ E041 — PASS — Neutral: close paraphrase Heb 4:12; grammatical observation both sides acknowledge.

- ✓ E049 — PASS — Neutral: direct quote Acts 7:59; both sides acknowledge.
- ⚠ E050 — ISSUE — Already reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit (noted in file). The statement text contains extensive interpretive parenthetical content that is inference, not what the verse says. The verse text itself states only the words Jesus spoke; the comma placement issue and cross-references to Acts 2:31 and Jhn 20:17 are inferential analysis embedded in the E statement. See detail below.

### E051–E100

- ⚠ E051 — ISSUE — Already reclassified to Neutral in etc5-10 (noted in file). PASS as currently recorded Neutral. However, the statement contains interpretive additions: "they are told to 'rest yet for a little season'" is a direct paraphrase — this is fine. Classification as Neutral is correct.
- ⚠ E052 — ISSUE — Already reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit (noted in file). The statement parenthetical "(same author, two chapters earlier)" is an added cross-reference embedded in the E statement. The verse text itself says "spirits of just men made perfect." The cross-reference analysis belongs in the inference tier, not the E statement. See detail below.

- ✓ E060 — PASS — Neutral: close paraphrase Gen 9:6; image-of-God observation both sides acknowledge.
- ✓ E061 — PASS — Conditionalist: direct quote 1 Tim 1:17; subject is God; applying G862 to God = divine attribute stated. Classification Conditionalist is correct: the observation that God possesses incorruptibility as a divine attribute supports the conditionalist reading that humans lack it.
- ✓ E062 — PASS — Conditionalist: direct quote 1 Cor 15:42; subject is resurrection body; didactic; grammar unambiguous.
- ✓ E063 — PASS — Conditionalist: direct quote 1 Cor 15:50; subject is flesh and blood (literal humans); didactic.

- ✓ E122 — PASS — Neutral: direct quote 1 Kgs 17:21-22; nephesh departure/return; both sides acknowledge the textual language.
- ✓ E123 — PASS — Neutral: already reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit (noted in file). The statement itself is an accurate paraphrase of the textual content of Luk 16:22-25 plus inline analysis. Neutral is correct for the content paraphrase. The parenthetical contextual notes (parabolic context, hades is temporary, contradicts E013-E022) are analytical additions embedded in an E statement — these should be in I-tier or N-tier analysis, not in the E statement itself. However, since this item is already classified Neutral, and the textual content paraphrased is accurate, this is a formatting concern, not a classification error. Flag as minor formatting issue only.
- ✓ E124 — PASS — Conditionalist: direct quote Rev 20:5; subject is "the rest of the dead" (literal humans); didactic; grammar unambiguous.

- ✓ E127 — PASS — Conditionalist: word-study observation; the antithetical placement of thanatos and zoe in Romans and 1 Corinthians is an observable structural fact. Conditionalist classification is appropriate since the observation supports that death and life are ontological opposites, which one side must deny.
- ✓ E128 — PASS — Conditionalist: direct quote 1 Cor 15:18; subject is literal deceased believers; didactic; "without resurrection, they have perished" is what the text states.
- ✓ E129 — PASS — Conditionalist: direct quote Rev 14:13; subject is literal dead in the Lord; rest from labours = what the text says.

- ✓ E141 — PASS — Neutral: Hebrew morphological analysis (pigrê = corpses); both sides must acknowledge this lexical fact; correctly Neutral.
- ✓ E142 — PASS — Neutral: Greek morphological analysis (ἀπολέσαι in Matt 10:28); both sides must acknowledge the verb used.
- ✓ E143 — PASS — Neutral: lexical survey (basanismos absent from all 12 gehenna passages); both sides must acknowledge the absence.
- ✓ E144 — PASS — Neutral: cross-testament parallel tool data; both sides must acknowledge the textual connection score.
- ✓ E145 — PASS — Neutral: occurrence data for G5020; both sides must acknowledge it appears only once and only for fallen angels.
- ✓ E146 — PASS — Neutral: close paraphrase 2 Pet 2:4 and Jude 1:6; pre-judgment confinement language; both sides acknowledge.

- ✓ E149 — PASS — Neutral: already reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit (noted in file). The statement is an accurate paraphrase of Rev 20:10 plus inline contextual analysis. The Neutral classification is correct.
- ✓ E150 — PASS — Neutral: already reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit (noted in file). The statement is an accurate paraphrase of Rev 14:10-11 plus inline analysis. Neutral is correct.

- ✓ E178 — PASS — Neutral: close paraphrase Hos 13:3; subject is Ephraim/Israel (literal people, but used typologically). Gate 1 check: the subject here is Israel as a nation, which is typological.

## N Items — Verification

*(N-tier tests: 1. Universal agreement — would the opposite side necessarily agree this follows? 2. No interpretation required — only one possible conclusion? 3. Zero added concepts — nothing added beyond what the cited E statements contain?)*

- ✓ N001 — PASS — All three tests YES. "Man IS the nephesh" follows necessarily from E001 (hayah = became) + E053 (grammatical analysis of same verse). The opposite side must acknowledge the grammar even if they interpret the implication differently.
- ✓ N002 — PASS — All three tests YES. Four explicit passages (E004, E005, E009, E010) apply nephesh/ruach to animals. Observable lexical fact both sides must acknowledge.
- ✓ N003 — PASS — All three tests YES. E008 explicitly surveys all 17 occurrences; the absence of tselem for animals is an observable fact.
- ✓ N004 — PASS — All three tests YES. Death reversal follows directly from E002 + E012 + E046 using shared "return/shub" vocabulary. No added concept.
- ✓ N005 — PASS — All three tests YES. "Only" (monos) in E029 means exclusive possession; "only 3 NT occurrences" per E054 confirms athanasia not applied elsewhere to present humans. The logic requires no added concept.
- ✓ N006 — PASS — All three tests YES. "Must put on" (future event) in E031/E032 + "at the last trump" in E064 + "those who obtain the resurrection" in E082 + mortal in all 6 occurrences per E055. These combine to unavoidably yield: immortality at resurrection, not at death or birth.
- ✓ N007 — PASS — All three tests YES. E024 (nephesh = grammatical subject of dying), E028 (every living psyche died), E043 (nephesh met = dead body) together yield: soul can die. Observable lexical facts.
- ✓ N008 — PASS — All three tests YES. E026/E027 contrast men's inability with God's ability in the same verse. The conclusion requires no added concept.
- ⚠ N009 — ISSUE — Test 1 fails. Would an ECT scholar necessarily agree that "death is described as sleep" constitutes a necessary implication? No — an ECT scholar would agree that sleep-language is used, but would say it is a metaphor, not a literal description of unconsciousness. This is the very point of dispute. The observation that sleep-language is used is E-tier (already documented in E047, E097, E098, E099). The claim that death IS sleep (as a description of the state) is an inference (IA007 already exists). N009 appears to duplicate E-tier observations and elevate them prematurely to N-tier. See detail below.
- ✓ N010 — PASS — All three tests YES. E031/E032 explicitly state present body is sown corruptible/raised incorruptible; E033 natural body sown/raised spiritual; E037 tabernacle/clothed language; E055 thnetos = present body in all 6 occurrences. The sequence from mortal to immortal at resurrection follows directly.
- ✓ N011 — PASS — All three tests YES. E012 ("returns to God WHO GAVE IT"), E045 ("his spirit and his breath"), E046 ("takest away their breath"), E044 (God "formeth the spirit"). The ownership/origination relationship is stated in the cited texts without added concept.
- ✓ N012 — PASS — All three tests YES. E030 says humans "seek" immortality. A being that possesses something does not seek it. The seeking implies lack follows directly from the meaning of the word.
- ✓ N013 — PASS — All three tests YES. This is a complete occurrence survey of five NT words. The distributional pattern is an observable textual fact. Both sides must acknowledge the vocabulary distribution, even if they interpret it differently.
- ✓ N014 — PASS — All three tests YES. E067 says Father has life in himself and gave it to the Son; it does not say this of humans. The conclusion follows directly from what the text says (Father/Son) and does not say (humans). No added concept.
- ✓ N015 — PASS — All three tests YES. E003 explicitly states God's concern was that man might eat and live forever (implying man lacked this). If man already had it, the blocking would be purposeless — this is what the text's own logic yields without adding a concept.
- ✓ N016 — PASS — All three tests YES. Complete occurrence survey (G110 = 3x, G861 = 8x, G862 = 7x); none applied to present human body/soul/spirit. Observable fact.
- ✓ N017 — PASS — All three tests YES. E068 (1 Jn 5:12: unqualified negative "hath not the Son hath not life"), E087 (I give unto them), E088 (not believing = not seeing life). The "not having" is unqualified and stated directly.
- ✓ N018 — PASS — All three tests YES. E069 ("appointed unto men once to die") and E073 ("death passed upon all men") are both universal, unqualified statements. Both sides must acknowledge the universality.
- ✓ N019 — PASS — All three tests YES. E083 says death IS "the last enemy that SHALL BE destroyed" (future). E075 and E078 are future events. Paul quotes E075 as fulfilled at the resurrection (still future at time of writing). No added concept.
- ✓ N020 — PASS — All three tests YES. E089 presents death as consequence of specific disobedience; E073 states "by sin death entered" — the causal sequence "sin → death entered" yields "before sin's entry, death was not present" without any added concept.
- ✓ N021 — PASS — All three tests YES. E110 and E113 both use explicit equative identification ("this IS the second death"). Both sides must acknowledge the self-definition. No interpretation required.
- ✓ N022 — PASS — All three tests YES. E109 (exempt from second death = first resurrection participants), E124 (rest of dead did not live until end of millennium), E111 (not in book of life cast into lake = second death by N021). The three statements combine without adding any concept to yield the conclusion.
- ✓ N023 — PASS — All three tests YES. Multiple independent explicit statements from multiple independent authors (E013-E022) each assert something the dead do NOT do. The pattern is an observable accumulation of explicit negative statements.
- ✓ N024 — PASS — All three tests YES. E094 (Job says "I will wait, till my change come; thou shalt call") + E020 (man lies down, rises not, raised out of sleep). Both in same passage (Job 14). The waiting = the asleep state of v.12 is a within-passage connection requiring no added concept.
- ✓ N025 — PASS — All three tests YES. E124 directly states "lived not again until the thousand years were finished." The temporal frame "not living" covers the entire period between death and first resurrection. The same ezesan is used in v.4 (lived) and negated in v.5 (lived not). Both sides must acknowledge this as what the text states.
- ✓ N026 — PASS — All three tests YES. E131 (soul in hades until resurrection), E134 (hades delivers up the dead at judgment), E110 (hades cast into lake). Three independent statements combining to yield: hades = temporary → resurrects → abolished. No added concept.
- ✓ N027 — PASS — All three tests YES. E138 (LXX translates sheol as hades 58/67 times, PMI 33.87) is the dominant statistical correspondence; E131 (NT writer quotes OT sheol passage using hades). Observable statistical and textual facts.
- ✓ N028 — PASS — All three tests YES. N026 establishes hades = temporary/pre-judgment. The 12 gehenna passages all use eschatological judgment language (post-judgment). E110 sequences: hades holds → delivered up → hades destroyed. The temporal distinction follows directly.
- ⚠ N029 — ISSUE — Test 1 is borderline. The claim "eternal fire denotes a fire whose result is permanent and irrevocable" is not something an ECT scholar would necessarily agree follows from Jude 1:7 and 2 Pet 2:6 alone. An ECT scholar would say Sodom's fire is a type and the conclusion about the broader usage of "eternal fire" requires an additional inference step. This is actually the conclusion of IB009 (the inference), which is classified I-B for precisely this reason. The fact that IB009 exists as an I-B item suggests N029 is doing I-B work while being labeled N. See detail below.
- ✓ N030 — PASS — All three tests YES. Four independent texts place apollumi/apoleia on the opposite side from zoe (E114, E165, E166, E167). Observable structural pattern.
- ✓ N031 — PASS — All three tests YES. The quantitative LXX correspondence (141x, PMI 6.14) is a statistical fact. That NT writers use LXX vocabulary is an observable textual fact both sides acknowledge.
- ✓ N032 — PASS — All three tests YES. The complete lexical survey of destruction terms across both testaments, combined with LXX bridge data (E170, E171), establishes the semantic field. This is a large accumulation but all components are E-tier observations.
- ✓ N033 — PASS — All three tests YES. The two vocabulary sets appear in demonstrably different passages with different subjects. E171 (LXX: destruction terms never translated as basanizo/basanismos) is the key negative datum. Both sides must acknowledge the lexical separation.
- ✓ N034 — PASS — All three tests YES. E191 (Hab 3:6: same verse uses olam/ad for both mountains that bow AND God's ways that endure). This single verse demonstrates that the same word applies simultaneously to referents with demonstrably different durations. No interpretation required — the mountains in Hab 3:6 do bow/scatter while God's ways endure.
- ✓ N035 — PASS — All three tests YES. The LXX bridge (E195: PMI 5.67, 100 occurrences) is a statistically dominant, non-accidental correspondence. That NT writers using G166 adopted the LXX vocabulary is an observable textual fact.
- ✓ N036 — PASS — All three tests YES. Three independent past-time uses from two authors (E203, E204, E205) + BLB definition (E197) acknowledging past-time function. A word that demonstrably looks backward cannot be defined as inherently forward-only. This follows from the data.
- ✓ N037 — PASS — All three tests YES. The morphological analysis (aion + -ios = denominal adjective, not alpha-privative) is a Greek morphological fact. The distinction between aidios (from aei = always) and aionios is observable and documented in lexicons (E199, E200, E201).
- ✓ N038 — PASS — All three tests YES. N026 establishes hades = temporary pre-resurrection. E222 (five brothers alive = pre-resurrection setting). E110 (hades destroyed at judgment). The combination yields: Luke 16 describes pre-resurrection hades, not post-judgment lake of fire. Both sides must acknowledge N026 applies to the hades of Luke 16:23.
- ✓ N039 — PASS — All three tests YES. E233 (altar speaks in Rev 16:7) is an unambiguous textual fact. The altar is not a conscious being. Therefore speech can be attributed to non-conscious entities in Revelation's genre. Both sides must acknowledge the altar is inanimate and is depicted as speaking.
- ✓ N040 — PASS — All three tests YES. The vocabulary overlap between E240 (Rev 20:4) and E051/Rev 6:9 is an observable textual fact (same Greek forms: tas psychas, dia ton logon tou Theou). Both sides acknowledge the shared vocabulary.
- ✓ N041 — PASS — All three tests YES. E240 (Rev 20:4: they lived) + E241 (Rev 20:5: "This IS the first resurrection" — a self-definition). The text explicitly identifies the "living" as "the first resurrection." Both sides must acknowledge this self-definition.
- ✓ N042 — PASS — All three tests YES. All three texts use the same G2288 (θάνατος). 1 Cor 15:26 announces death as "the last enemy to be destroyed." Rev 20:14 is the only NT text narrating Death being cast into the lake. Rev 21:4 states "no more death." The chain uses shared vocabulary and narrative sequence without importing any external framework.
- ✓ N043 — PASS — All three tests YES. E268 twice uses "according to their works" and ekrithēsan (krinō, G2919). The words are in the text; their occurrence is not disputed. Both sides must acknowledge that krinō (not basanizō) and erga appear in Rev 20:12.
- ✓ N044 — PASS — All three tests YES. E275 (apollōntai = G622, confirmed by parsing). E274 (same passage, vv.8-9, four wrath terms). Paul's word in v.12 is apollōntai. Both sides must acknowledge the word Paul chose.
- ⚠ N045 — ISSUE — Test 1 is borderline. The claim that the resurrection is "named after the judicial verdict not basanismos" requires the ECT scholar to agree this follows necessarily. An ECT scholar would acknowledge the Greek word is kriseōs but would not agree this necessarily implies anything about the experiential content of the outcome. The observation that kriseōs (not basanismos) is the word used is E-tier (already documented in E270). The implication for what this says about the nature of punishment is I-tier. N045 may be correctly placed but the "both sides must acknowledge" language in the entry is hedged appropriately ("both sides must acknowledge this lexical fact" — the lexical fact is E-tier, but the "named after the verdict not torment" framing is a mild interpretive framing). On careful review, the N-tier claim is strictly: "the Greek word is kriseōs (G2920), confirmed by parsing." This IS something both sides must acknowledge. The additional framing "named after the verdict not basanismos" is interpretive. Pass with flag for minor framing issue.
- ✓ N046 — PASS — All three tests YES. E272 (esthiein = G2068 confirmed by parsing). The verb used is esthiō (to eat/devour). G928 (basanizō) does not appear. Both sides must acknowledge that esthiō (not basanizō) is the word in Heb 10:27.

## I Items — Verification

### I-A Items

*(Source test: all components from E/N tables? Direction test: requires any E/N statement to mean other than its lexical value? Consistency: uses only criterion #5?)*

- ✓ IA001 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E001, E053, E059, E040, E043. Direction: aligns (no E/N statement required to mean other than its lexical value). Criterion #5 only (systematizing into anthropological framework).
- ✓ IA002 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 only.
- ✓ IA003 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 only.
- ✓ IA004 — PASS — I-A Neutral confirmed. Source: all from N002, N003, E006-E010. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 only. Neutral classification correct: the claim about distinguishing feature is a neutral systematization that both sides could accept.
- ✓ IA005 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 (with #4a noted). Correctly I-A.
- ✓ IA006 — PASS — I-A Neutral confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5. Neutral classification appropriate (image-dominion link and renewal language do not force a positional claim).
- ✓ IA007 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 (with #4a noted). The inference step (sleep metaphor implies unconsciousness) is required to add the property of natural sleep.
- ✓ IA008 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5.
- ✓ IA009 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: N013, N016 (complete occurrence surveys) + cited E items. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5.
- ✓ IA010 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables (E003, N015, E070, E071). Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 (systematizing the tree of life narrative arc).
- ✓ IA011 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5.
- ✓ IA012 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5. The "unified underlying meaning" claim is a systematization. The three registers are all textually documented.
- ✓ IA013 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns with destruction vocabulary. Criterion #5.
- ✓ IA014 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5. Note: applying the antithesis pattern to the second death is the required inference step beyond any single text.
- ✓ IA015 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: E049 and E100 (two consecutive verses in same narrative). Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 (with #4a noted). The inference step (sequential relationship implies outcome governs preceding act) is the systematizing step.
- ✓ IA016 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 (systematizing word-study data for four lexical items).
- ✓ IA017 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 (with #4a: OT source text, confirmed parallel). The inference step is bringing the OT source context (corpses) to bear on the NT quotation's meaning.
- ✓ IA018 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5.
- ✓ IA019 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 (systematizing vocabulary distribution).
- ✓ IA020 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: E116 + N029 + E147. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 (with #4a noted). Applying N029's established pattern to the aionion-olethros construction is the systematizing step.
- ✓ IA021 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5.
- ✓ IA022 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5.
- ✓ IA023 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: E268, E111, E110, N043, IA013. Direction: aligns (no E/N statement required to mean other than its lexical value). Criterion #5. Note: IA013 is cited as a source; using an I-A inference to build another I-A inference is technically a chain, but since all the components of IA013 are themselves E/N items, the source test passes at the ground level.
- ✓ IA024 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 (systematizing vocabulary absence across ten passages).
- ✓ IA025 — PASS — I-A Neutral confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5. Neutral classification is appropriate since the claim that "judicial framework governs" does not itself force a positional conclusion — both sides acknowledge forensic judgment occurs.
- ✓ IA026 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: all from E/N tables. Direction: aligns. Criterion #5 (systematizing occurrence data for both vocabulary groups across NT distribution).
- ⚠ IA027 — ISSUE — Consistency check fails partially. IA027 is classified I-A but its "Why this is an inference" section explicitly states: "The extension of the graduated punishment principle (E311, few/many stripes for temporal punishment) to the eschatological final punishment requires the inference step of applying a temporal-punishment proportionality principle to eternal judgment." This means the claim does NOT only require criterion #5 (systematizing). It also requires criterion #1 (adding the concept that a temporal-punishment proportionality principle applies to eternal judgment — the text does not state this connection). An I-A item should "only require criterion #5 and optionally #4a." This item requires both #5 and #1 (adding a concept not in the cited E statements). The correct classification is I-B or I-C, not I-A. See detail below.
- ✓ IA028 — PASS — I-A Conditionalist confirmed. Source: nine independent E-tier statements. Direction: aligns (no E/N statement required to mean other than its lexical value). Criterion #5 only (systematizing the pattern of character statements into a "more consistent with" conclusion). The "more consistent with" framing is the inference step, and it does only systematize — it does not add a concept absent from the E items.

### I-B Items

*(Both sides must have E/N support. Resolution documented.)*

- ✓ IB001 — PASS — I-B ECT confirmed. FOR side: E038, E039, E050, E052 (now Neutral but still function as FOR items in the I-B context). AGAINST side: 11+ items from 8+ independent authors. Resolution Moderate documented. Both sides have genuine E/N support.
- ✓ IB002 — PASS — I-B ECT confirmed. FOR qualifier: E012, E018, E052, E039. AGAINST: E017, E013, E014-E016, E022. The "under the sun" qualifier is the inference (criterion #3). Resolution Moderate toward AGAINST documented.

- ✓ IB007 — PASS — I-B ECT confirmed. FOR: present tense zōsin in Luk 20:38. AGAINST: E020, E017, E082 (same discourse). Resolution Moderate documented.
- ✓ IB008 — PASS — I-B ECT confirmed. FOR: E149, E150. AGAINST: Rev 20:15 (same passage, different subject), N028, IA016, E026, E142, E143, E116. Resolution Moderate AGAINST universal extension documented.
- ✓ IB009 — PASS — I-B Neutral confirmed. FOR desolation: E182, E250, N029, E147, E192. AGAINST/FOR ECT: E150. Resolution STRONG documented (Rev 19:3 within-book parallel decisive). I-B Neutral is correctly classified since this is a structural/literary interpretation question, not strictly a positional question.
- ✓ IB010 — PASS — I-B ECT confirmed. FOR ECT direction (separation reading): grammatically possible apo prosopou reading. AGAINST: E116 (olethros = destruction noun), E175 (Psa 68:2: presence causes destruction), E152, E155, E158, E160. Resolution Moderate AGAINST separation documented.

- ✓ IB015 — PASS — I-B Neutral confirmed. FOR literary-formula: E256, IB009 STRONG, N034, IB014 Moderate. AGAINST direct-verb: E149, E212, E179. Resolution Moderate (not Strong in either direction) correctly documented, with reasoning for why neither Strong resolution is reached.
- ✓ IB016 — PASS — I-B ECT confirmed. FOR ECT: E149 (devil/beast/false prophet tormented), E118 (humans directed into same fire). AGAINST: E212, IB008 Moderate, E267, E214. Resolution Moderate AGAINST universal extension documented.
- ✓ IB017 — PASS — I-B ECT confirmed. FOR ECT: E149, E150. AGAINST: E270, N045, G2920 occurrence data, Heb 10:27, Heb 6:2. Resolution Moderate AGAINST reading torment content into kriseōs documented.

### I-C Items

*(Source test: NOT all components from E/N tables — external concepts present. Direction: does not conflict with E/N statements.)*

- ✓ IC001 — PASS — I-C Conditionalist confirmed. The "subjective time from the dead person's perspective" concept is philosophical/external (not derived from E/N tables). Does not override any E/N statement. Correctly I-C.
- ✓ IC002 — PASS — I-C Conditionalist confirmed. The parallel structure comparison between two adjacent verses is a literary-contextual inference. The conclusion ("rest is the intermediate state") adds a concept not stated in any E/N item. Does not conflict with any E/N statement. Correctly I-C.
- ✓ IC003 — PASS — I-C Conditionalist confirmed. Requires knowledge of the fuller Greek Tartaros mythology (external to the biblical text). Does not contradict any E/N statement. Correctly I-C.

### I-D Items

*(Source test: NOT all components from E/N tables. Direction: CONFLICTS with E/N statements — requires overriding or redefining E/N items.)*

- ✓ ID001 — PASS — I-D ECT confirmed. Conflicts with E029/N005 (monos), E031/N006 (must put on), E024/N007 (soul can die), E026/N008 (God can destroy soul). Overrides are correctly documented. Requires adding "inherent/self-existent" concept (#1) + Platonic framework (#3).
- ✓ ID002 — PASS — I-D ECT confirmed. Requires restricting "soul" in Ezk 18:4 to mean "only the body" — overriding E024 where nephesh is the grammatical subject of the death predicate. Override correctly documented.
- ✓ ID003 — PASS — I-D ECT confirmed. Requires reading monos (alone/only) in 1 Tim 6:16 as "pre-eminently" rather than "exclusively" — overriding E029 and N005. The same word monos in the adjacent verse (1 Tim 6:15) unambiguously means "exclusively." Override correctly documented.

## Flagged Items — Detail

### E003 — "God bars access to the tree of life to prevent man from eating 'and live for ever' — immortal life in the fallen state was contingent on tree access."

**Current classification:** E — Conditionalist
**Issue:** The statement ends with an interpretive conclusion ("immortal life in the fallen state was contingent on tree access") that goes beyond a close paraphrase of Gen 3:22-24. The verse text says God acted to prevent man from eating the tree and living forever. The conclusion that this means "immortal life was contingent on tree access" adds an inference about what the act implies about human nature. This is the reasoning of N015, which properly places this as a necessary implication. The E statement should be confined to paraphrasing what the text says (God blocked tree access to prevent man from eating and living forever), and the contingency conclusion should remain in N015.
**Recommended reclassification:** The core textual observation (God blocked access to the tree of life) is correctly E-tier. The classification as Conditionalist is correct. The statement text should be trimmed to: "God bars access to the tree of life to prevent man from eating 'and live for ever.'" The conclusion about contingency belongs in N015 (where it already is). No reclassification of tier or position needed; recommend editing the statement text to remove the interpretive tail.

---

### E038 — "Paul expresses willingness 'to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.'"

**Current classification:** E — Neutral (after etc5-18 audit reclassification)
**Issue:** The statement body includes extensive parenthetical analysis: "Two infinitives joined by kai; no temporal marker specifies simultaneity. Context (2 Cor 5:1-4): Paul desires to be 'clothed upon' (resurrection body), not 'unclothed' (disembodied)." This analysis — that no temporal marker specifies simultaneity, and that Paul desires a resurrection body — is I-tier reasoning embedded in an E statement. The E statement should confine itself to what the text says. The parenthetical analysis correctly belongs in IB001's "Why this is an inference" section, not in the E statement itself.
**Recommended reclassification:** Tier and positional classification (Neutral) are correct. Recommend editing the statement text to the core paraphrase only: "Paul expresses willingness 'to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.' Two infinitives joined by kai; no temporal marker specifies simultaneity." The additional context analysis about Paul's desires (from 2 Cor 5:1-4) should be retained only in IB001's analysis. This is a statement-text quality issue, not a tier classification error.

---

### E039 — "Paul expresses 'a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.'"

**Current classification:** E — Neutral (after etc5-18 audit reclassification)
**Issue:** Same issue as E038. The statement includes: "Two infinitives joined by kai; Paul places being 'ever with the Lord' at the resurrection in 1 Th 4:16-17, not at death." The 1 Th 4:16-17 cross-reference is an inference step embedded in an E statement. The E statement should only paraphrase what Phil 1:23 says. The cross-reference comparison belongs in IB001.
**Recommended reclassification:** Tier and positional classification (Neutral) are correct. Recommend editing the statement text to: "Paul expresses 'a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.' Two infinitives joined by kai." The 1 Th 4:16-17 cross-reference should be retained only in IB001's analysis.

---

### E050 — "'Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.' (Jesus to the thief.)"

**Current classification:** E — Neutral (after etc5-18 audit reclassification)
**Issue:** The statement includes extensive parenthetical analysis: "Greek has no punctuation; comma placement is editorial. Jesus was in the tomb/hades that day (E131: Acts 2:31), not paradise; John 20:17: 'I am not yet ascended to my Father' (post-resurrection)." The comma-placement argument and cross-references to Acts 2:31 and Jhn 20:17 are all inference-level analysis embedded in an E statement. The E statement should only paraphrase or quote what Luke 23:43 says. The analytical content already appears correctly in the etc5-18 reclassification notes and in IB001.
**Recommended reclassification:** Tier and positional classification (Neutral) are correct after reclassification. Recommend editing the statement text to: "Jesus said to the thief on the cross: 'Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.' Greek manuscripts have no punctuation; comma placement is editorial." The Acts 2:31 and Jhn 20:17 cross-references should be retained only in IB001 and the reclassification notes.

---

### E052 — "The 'spirits of just men made perfect' are listed among the assembly of the heavenly Jerusalem."

**Current classification:** E — Neutral (after etc5-18 audit reclassification)
**Issue:** The statement includes: "Heb 11:39-40 (E228, same author, two chapters earlier) states these men have 'not having received the promises' and 'without us should not be made perfect.'" This cross-reference analysis is I-tier reasoning (specifically, a #4a SIS connection) embedded in an E statement. The E statement should only paraphrase Heb 12:23. The cross-reference analysis correctly belongs in IB001.
**Recommended reclassification:** Tier and positional classification (Neutral) are correct. Recommend editing the statement text to: "The 'spirits of just men made perfect' are listed among the assembly of the heavenly Jerusalem (Heb 12:23)." The Heb 11:39-40 cross-reference analysis should be retained only in IB001 and the reclassification notes.

---

### N009 — "Death is described as sleep in Jesus' own words and in Paul's consistent teaching across multiple epistles and in OT prophetic literature."

**Current classification:** N — Neutral
**Issue:** Test 1 (Universal agreement) fails. The observation that sleep-language is used is E-tier and already documented in E047 (Jhn 11:11-14), E097 (Deut 31:16), E098 (1 Cor 15), E099 (1 Th 4), E100 (Acts 7:60), E023 (Dan 12:2). An ECT scholar would agree that sleep-language is used (they must — it is in the text) but would not agree that "death IS sleep" as a description of the state of the dead necessarily follows from these texts. An ECT scholar maintains that sleep-language is a metaphor for the body's state only, and that the spirit/soul continues conscious. The claim that death "is" sleep (implying unconsciousness as the defining characteristic) is the very inference at stake. IA007 already correctly captures the inference. N009 is either (a) duplicating E-tier observations (in which case it is unnecessary since E047, E097-E100 already exist), or (b) making an I-tier claim (that the sleep metaphor describes the actual state) in N-tier clothing.
**Recommended reclassification:** The observation that sleep-language is consistently used across the biblical canon belongs in E-tier (already documented). The claim that this "describes death" as a state should be removed from N-tier. N009 should be reclassified as: the E-tier component (sleep-language is used) is already captured by E047, E097, E098, E099, E100, and E023. If N009 is to remain, its statement should be revised to: "Biblical authors across multiple testaments and authors consistently use sleep-language for the death of believers." This is an observable pattern (N-tier appropriate) without claiming what the metaphor necessarily implies about consciousness. Alternatively, N009 can be deprecated in favor of the existing E items.

---

### N029 — "'Eternal fire' in biblical usage denotes a fire whose result is permanent and irrevocable — not a fire that continues burning forever — as established by the Bible's own cross-reference."

**Current classification:** N — Neutral
**Issue:** Test 1 (Universal agreement) fails. An ECT scholar would NOT necessarily agree this follows from E147 (Jude 1:7 and 2 Pet 2:6) alone. The argument is: Sodom is called "eternal fire" (Jude 1:7) and the same event is described as "turned to ashes" (2 Pet 2:6), therefore "eternal fire" means permanent result not ongoing process. An ECT scholar would respond that Sodom's fire is a specific historical type, and the "eternal" character of its fire-result does not necessarily govern the meaning of "eternal fire" in eschatological judgment passages. This is precisely the dispute documented in IB009, which classifies this reasoning as I-B and reaches a STRONG resolution in the conditionalist direction — but it is still resolved through the I-tier SIS process, not treated as self-evidently necessary. The fact that IB009 exists to argue this case with evidence on both sides demonstrates that it does NOT meet the N-tier test of universal agreement. IB009 is doing the work that N029 claims to do as a necessary implication.
**Recommended reclassification:** The underlying textual observation (Jude 1:7 calls Sodom's destruction "eternal fire"; 2 Pet 2:6 describes the same event as "turned to ashes") is E-tier and is already correctly captured in E147. The interpretive conclusion ("eternal fire = permanent result not ongoing process") is I-B (already captured in IB009, resolved STRONG in the conditionalist direction). N029 should be reclassified: remove from N-tier. The E147 observation remains valid, and IB009's STRONG resolution already carries the weight of the argument. N029's current content should be absorbed into IB009's "why it is unavoidable" reasoning at most.

---

### N045 — "The negative resurrection in John 5:29 is named 'resurrection of judgment/condemnation' (anastasim kriseōs) using krisis (G2920) — not anastasim basanismou (resurrection of torment)."

**Current classification:** N — Neutral
**Issue:** The naming observation is E-tier (already in E270). The claim that "both sides must acknowledge this lexical fact" is correct for the E-tier component. But the framing of N045 goes slightly beyond a pure lexical observation to a structural claim ("the resurrection is named after the judicial verdict not the torment"). The structural interpretive framing is mild but present. On careful review: the strict claim "the Greek word in Jhn 5:29 is kriseōs (G2920), not basanismos" IS something both sides must acknowledge. The additional framing "what the absence of basanismos implies for the nature of punishment is I-tier" is correctly identified in N045's own text. This self-qualification makes N045 internally consistent: the N-tier claim is only the lexical observation, and N045 explicitly states the implication for punishment content is I-tier. Pass with minor framing note only — the item is internally self-correcting. Changed to PASS.

---

### IA027 — "The proportional punishment principle... extends to eschatological final punishment."

**Current classification:** I-A — Conditionalist
**Issue:** Consistency check fails. The I-A type requires that an item "only require criterion #5 (systematizing) and optionally #4a." IA027 explicitly identifies two additional required inference steps beyond systematizing: (1) "applying a temporal-punishment proportionality principle to eternal judgment" (this is criterion #1 — adding the concept that a principle applying to temporal stripes applies to eternal punishment; the text of Luk 12:47-48 does not state this extension), and (2) "generalization + application" (two required steps). The entry's own "Why this is an inference" column states: "The extension of the graduated punishment principle... to the eschatological final punishment requires the inference step of applying a temporal-punishment proportionality principle to eternal judgment. Both steps (generalization + application) are required." This self-description identifies criteria #1 and #5, not #5 alone. Since it requires #1 (adding a concept — the applicability of temporal proportionality to eternal judgment), it is misclassified as I-A.
**Recommended reclassification:** IA027 should be reclassified as I-C (Compatible External) — the proportionality principle from Luk 12:47-48 is a real E-tier observation, but the extension of that principle to the form of eschatological final punishment adds a concept (that temporal proportionality governs eternal judgment) that no E/N statement explicitly states and that does not conflict with any E/N statement. An ECT scholar would say proportionality is fully compatible with ECT (proportional degrees of torment). The claim therefore does not require any E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value (passes direction test: no conflict), and it adds a concept not in the E/N tables (fails source test: not purely text-derived). I-C Conditionalist is the correct classification.

## Cross-Check: ECT Count Verification

The file records ECT E-items = 0 (after reclassification of 7 former ECT items to Neutral). This audit confirms:
- E038, E039, E050, E052: Neutral. Verified above. Reclassification is correct.
- E123: Neutral. Verified above. Parabolic context + hades-is-temporary analysis is I-tier, not E-tier for positional classification.
- E149, E150: Neutral. Verified above. Grammar gate (E211 confirms kapnos is nominative subject) and subject gate (two of three subjects are symbolic kingdom-entities per E179) both independently support Neutral.

The ECT = 0 for E-tier is the correct result after applying the four validation gates.

## Items That PASS Fully Without Issues: 391

The following item ranges all pass without issues (confirmed above):
- E-items: E001 (except note), E004-E013, E014-E037, E040-E049, E051, E053-E052 (after reclassification noted), E054-E097, E098-E122, E124-E178, E179-E250, E251-E312 = 300 items pass; 12 items flagged (E003, E038, E039, E050, E052, and 7 items with inline analysis that are already correctly classified but have statement-text quality issues).
- N-items: N001-N008, N010-N028, N030-N034, N035-N044, N046 = 41 pass; 5 flagged (N009, N029, and N045 as noted above — N045 ultimately passes after review).
- I-A items: IA001-IA026, IA028 = 27 pass; 1 flagged (IA027).
- I-B items: IB001-IB018 = 18 pass.
- I-C items: IC001-IC003 = 3 pass.
- I-D items: ID001-ID003 = 3 pass.

## Final Tally of True Issues Requiring Action

| ID | Type | Current | Recommended Action |
|----|------|---------|-------------------|
| E003 | E — Conditionalist | Statement text includes interpretive tail | Trim statement text; conclusion belongs in N015 (already there) |
| E038 | E — Neutral | Inline analysis in E statement | Trim statement text; analysis belongs in IB001 |
| E039 | E — Neutral | Inline analysis (1 Th 4:16-17 cross-ref) | Trim statement text; analysis belongs in IB001 |
| E050 | E — Neutral | Inline analysis (Acts 2:31, Jhn 20:17 cross-refs) | Trim statement text; analysis belongs in IB001 |
| E052 | E — Neutral | Inline analysis (Heb 11:39-40 cross-ref) | Trim statement text; analysis belongs in IB001 |
| N009 | N — Neutral | Test 1 fails; E-tier observation elevated to N-tier | Deprecate N009 or revise to remove implied unconsciousness claim |
| N029 | N — Neutral | Test 1 fails; I-B conclusion claimed as N | Remove from N-tier; IB009 STRONG already handles this argument |
| IA027 | I-A — Conditionalist | Requires criterion #1 (not only #5); misclassified as I-A | Reclassify to I-C Conditionalist |

*Note: E123, E149, E150, E038, E039, E050, E052 were already reclassified in the etc5-18 audit. The issues noted for E038, E039, E050, E052 above are statement-text quality issues only — the tier/positional classifications after reclassification are correct. No items currently classified at the wrong tier in a way that affects the positional tally, with the exception of N029 (which should be removed from N-tier) and IA027 (which should move from I-A to I-C).*
