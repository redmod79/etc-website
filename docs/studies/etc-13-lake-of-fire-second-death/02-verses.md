### ALL FIVE LAKE-OF-FIRE PASSAGES

#### Rev 19:17-21 — Context: Beast and False Prophet Cast Alive
> Rev 19:17 — And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
> Rev 19:18 — That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.
> Rev 19:19 — And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
> **Rev 19:20 — And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.**
> Rev 19:21 — And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.

*Notes: First lake-of-fire occurrence. Beast and false prophet cast "alive" (ζῶντες, Present Active Participle). The human remnant (armies) are "slain with the sword" in contrast — they die, these two are cast in living. No torment language here.*

#### Rev 20:1-15 — Full Millennium-to-Great-White-Throne Passage

> Rev 20:1 — And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
> Rev 20:2 — And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
> Rev 20:3 — And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
> Rev 20:4 — And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
> **Rev 20:5 — But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.**
> **Rev 20:6 — Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.**
> Rev 20:7 — And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
> Rev 20:8 — And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
> Rev 20:9 — And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
> **Rev 20:10 — And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.**
> Rev 20:11 — And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
> Rev 20:12 — And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
> **Rev 20:13 — And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.**
> **Rev 20:14 — And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.**
> **Rev 20:15 — And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.**

*Notes: The complete passage showing all four groups in Rev 20:7-15:*
- *v.9 — nations (human armies) "devoured" by fire from heaven (katephagen = consumption vocabulary)*
- *v.10 — devil, beast, false prophet "tormented day and night for ever and ever"*
- *v.14 — death and hades "cast into the lake of fire = THIS IS THE SECOND DEATH"*
- *v.15 — human wicked ("whosoever not found written in the book of life") "cast into the lake of fire" (no torment formula added)*

#### Rev 21:1-8 — New Creation Through Second Death
> **Rev 21:1 — And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.**
> Rev 21:2 — And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
> Rev 21:3 — And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
> **Rev 21:4 — And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.**
> Rev 21:5 — And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
> Rev 21:6 — And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
> **Rev 21:7 — He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.**
> **Rev 21:8 — But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.**

*Notes: The new creation promises "no more death" (v.4), then immediately (vv.7-8) presents the antithesis: overcomers inherit life; the wicked have their part in the lake = second death. The "no more death" promise of v.4 and the "second death" identification in v.8 are in immediate proximity. The lake is described with a Present Passive Participle: kaioumenē (burning/being burned) — the lake burns.*

### DEATH AND HADES PAIRED PASSAGES

#### Rev 1:18 — Christ Holds Keys
> **Rev 1:18 — I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.**

*Notes: Christ himself was dead and is now alive. He holds the keys of Hades (G86) and death (G2288). The "keys" language indicates authority over these powers. This is E120 in master.*

---

#### Rev 6:8 — Pale Horse: Death and Hades as Personified Powers
> **Rev 6:8 — And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.**

*Notes: Death (G2288) and Hades (G86) are here personified as riders/followers — they have power to kill. They are active destructive powers in the current age. Their eventual casting into the lake (Rev 20:14) ends this power.*

---

#### Rev 20:13 — Death and Hades Deliver Up the Dead
> **Rev 20:13 — And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.**

*Notes: Just before their own casting into the lake (v.14), Death and Hades are emptied of their contents — the dead held by them are released for judgment. After delivering up the dead, Death and Hades themselves are cast in.*

---

### SECOND DEATH — OVERCOMER EXEMPTION

#### Rev 2:11 — Not Hurt of the Second Death
> **Rev 2:11 — He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.**

*Notes: This is E108 in master (etc5-03). The second death is described as something that can "hurt" (adikeo, G91 — to do wrong to, to injure). Overcomers are exempt from this injury/hurt. This is the earliest mention of the "second death" in Revelation.*

---

#### Rev 20:5-6 — First Resurrection; Second Death Has No Power
> Rev 20:5 — But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
> **Rev 20:6 — Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.**

*Notes: Greek of Rev 20:6: "ὁ δεύτερος θάνατος οὐκ ἔχει ἐξουσίαν" — the second death does not have authority/power (exousia, G1849). Present Active Indicative: "does not have" power, as a current state of powerlessness over the first-resurrection participants. This is E109 (also master).*

### DEATH AS LAST ENEMY — 1 CORINTHIANS 15

#### 1 Cor 15:20-28 — Christ's Resurrection; Last Enemy = Death
> 1 Cor 15:20 — But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
> 1 Cor 15:21 — For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
> 1 Cor 15:22 — For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
> 1 Cor 15:23 — But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
> 1 Cor 15:24 — Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
> 1 Cor 15:25 — For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
> **1 Cor 15:26 — The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.**
> 1 Cor 15:27 — For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.
> 1 Cor 15:28 — And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.

*Notes: Greek of 1 Cor 15:26: "ἔσχατος ἐχθρὸς καταργεῖται ὁ θάνατος" — "the last enemy to be abolished/rendered inoperative is death." The verb is katageitai (G2673, Present Passive Indicative 3rd singular). The present tense here is futuristic or gnomic — the process of destroying death is certain and has begun (Christ's resurrection), but the final destruction of death is at the last resurrection. Note the reversal in Rev 20:14: death itself is cast into the lake of fire = the second death. Death is destroyed BY dying — the second death.*

---

#### 1 Cor 15:50-57 — Mortality Swallowed Up; Death's Sting
> 1 Cor 15:50 — Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
> 1 Cor 15:51 — Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
> 1 Cor 15:52 — In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
> 1 Cor 15:53 — For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
> **1 Cor 15:54 — So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.**
> **1 Cor 15:55 — O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?**
> 1 Cor 15:56 — The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
> 1 Cor 15:57 — But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

*Notes: Greek of 1 Cor 15:54: "Κατεπόθη ὁ θάνατος εἰς νῖκος" — "Death was swallowed up into victory." Katepothē (G2666, Aorist Passive Indicative — "was swallowed up") quotes Isa 25:8. The Aorist is proleptic (anticipatory) — the future event described as a completed fact. When the resurrection happens, death is swallowed up. Death ceases. The apostrophe in v.55 quotes Hos 13:14 (O death, I will be thy plagues — adapted by Paul as a taunt over defeated death).*

### OT DEATH-DEFEAT PASSAGES

#### Isa 25:6-9 — God Swallows Up Death in Victory
> Isa 25:6 — And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
> Isa 25:7 — And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.
> **Isa 25:8 — He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.**
> Isa 25:9 — And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

*Notes: E075 in master. God "swallows up death" (billa hammavet, Hebrew — literally "to swallow up, engulf, destroy completely"). Death is not continued/transformed but engulfed and ended. Paul quotes this in 1 Cor 15:54. The wiping away of tears also appears in Rev 21:4 (same context: no more death in new creation).*

---

#### Hos 13:14 — I Will Redeem from Death; O Death, Thy Plagues
> **Hos 13:14 — I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.**

*Notes: E078 in master. God addresses death and the grave (sheol) as powers that will be destroyed. "O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction" — direct apostrophe to death and sheol as powers God will overcome. Paul quotes in 1 Cor 15:55 (modified as a taunt). Note: the "repentance shall be hid from mine eyes" shows God's irrevocable determination — he will not change his mind about defeating death.*

---

### CHRIST ABOLISHES DEATH

#### 2 Tim 1:9-10 — Christ Abolished Death
> 2 Tim 1:9 — Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
> **2 Tim 1:10 — But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:**

*Notes: E081 in master. "Abolished death" — katargeō (G2673), the same verb used in 1 Cor 15:26 for death being "destroyed" (the last enemy). Christ has abolished death in principle through his resurrection; the full realization comes at the last resurrection (1 Cor 15:26,54).*

---

#### Heb 2:14-15 — Destroy Him That Had Power of Death
> Heb 2:14 — Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
> **Heb 2:15 — And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.**

*Notes: E086 in master. "Destroy him that had the power of death" — katargeō again (G2673). The devil "had the power of death" (ton kratos echonta tou thanatou). Christ's purpose in the Incarnation was to render this power inoperative/destroyed. E261 (etc5-12) established that katargeō in Heb 2:14 leaves open whether this is power-only or existence-destroying.*

---

### DEATH AND LIFE ANTITHESIS

#### Rom 5:12-21 — Sin and Death by Adam; Life by Christ
> **Rom 5:12 — Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:**
> Rom 5:14 — Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
> Rom 5:17 — For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.
> Rom 5:18 — Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.
> **Rom 5:21 — That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.**

*Notes: Death and eternal life are the two outcomes. Sin reigns "unto death"; grace reigns "unto eternal life." The antithesis is structural throughout Romans 5-8.*

---

#### Rom 6:20-23 — Wages of Sin = Death; Gift = Eternal Life
> Rom 6:20 — For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
> Rom 6:21 — What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
> Rom 6:22 — But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
> **Rom 6:23 — For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.**

*Notes: E072 in master. The most concise formulation of the death/life antithesis in Paul. "Wages" (opsōnia, G3800 — military wages, what is earned) of sin = death. "Gift" (charisma, G5486) of God = eternal life. Death is what sin earns; eternal life is what God gives. These are the direct contrasts.*

---

#### Rev 21:4 — No More Death
> **Rev 21:4 — And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.**

*Notes: E112 in master. In the new creation, "there shall be no more death" — ouk estai eti (will not be any longer). Death is one of "the former things" (ta prōta) that have passed away. This statement is made immediately before the second death/lake passage of Rev 21:8. The "no more death" of v.4 describes the new creation for the redeemed; the second death of v.8 describes the fate of the wicked.*

---

### BRIMSTONE AS DESTRUCTION TYPE

#### Gen 19:24-25 — Fire and Brimstone on Sodom
> **Gen 19:24 — Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;**
> Gen 19:25 — And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

*Notes: The original brimstone-and-fire judgment. The result was complete overthrow and destruction.*

---

#### 2 Pet 2:4-9 — Sodom Turned to Ashes (as Example)
> 2 Pet 2:4 — For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
> 2 Pet 2:5 — And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
> **2 Pet 2:6 — And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;**
> 2 Pet 2:7 — And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:
> 2 Pet 2:9 — The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:

*Notes: Peter explicitly calls Sodom "an ensample" (hupodeigma — G5262, example/model) for those who will live ungodly. The result of brimstone-and-fire on Sodom = ashes (katastrephō to tephroō = "turned to ashes"). Sodom is a type of final judgment: fire falls, cities are reduced to ashes. This is used by conditionalists to argue that fire destroys rather than perpetually burns.*

---

#### Jude 1:7 — Eternal Fire (Sodom)
> **Jude 1:7 — Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.**

*Notes: Sodom "suffered the vengeance of eternal fire" (puros aiōniou — genitive). The fire was "eternal" in its effects and source, but Sodom itself became ashes (2 Pet 2:6). The "eternal" fire is typically interpreted either as: (1) the fire whose consequences/punishment are eternal (Conditionalist), or (2) fire that burns eternally (ECT). Note that 2 Pet 2:6 explicitly says Sodom became ashes, not that it burns forever.*

---

#### Isa 30:33 — Topheth: Fire and Brimstone
> **Isa 30:33 — For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.**

*Notes: Topheth as a place of consuming fire prepared for judgment. The imagery is of a great bonfire/pile that burns. This OT fire-and-brimstone image feeds into the "lake of fire burning with brimstone" in Revelation.*

## Additional Context Passages

### Rev 22:15 — Those Outside (parallels Rev 21:8)
From parallels data: REV 22:15 closely parallels REV 21:8 (same categories of the condemned). The excluded ones are "outside" the new Jerusalem — exclusion language rather than torment language for this group.

### Rev 20:5 — Rest of Dead "Lived Not"
From the passage: "But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished." This is E124 (master). The wicked dead are described negatively — they did not live — during the millennium.
