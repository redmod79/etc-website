### Analysis
- The word limne simply means "lake" or "pond" — a body of standing water.
- Five uses are literal (Lake of Gennesaret in Luke).
- Five uses are in Revelation for the "lake of fire" (limne tou puros).
- The "lake of fire" is a construct unique to Revelation. It does not appear in the OT, the Gospels, the Epistles, or any other NT book.
- The phrase "lake of fire" is not identical to "gehenna" (G1067), "sheol/hades" (G86), or "fire" generally (G4442). It is a distinct image in Revelation's apocalyptic framework.
