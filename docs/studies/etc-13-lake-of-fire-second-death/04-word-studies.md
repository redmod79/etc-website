## G3041 — λίμνη (limnē) — Lake

**Transliteration:** limnē
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**BLB Count:** 10 occurrences
**Definition:** a pond (through the idea of nearness of shore)

### Translations
100% translated "lake" — no variation.

### All 10 NT Occurrences
- Luke 5:1 — "the lake of Gennesaret" (physical lake, fishing context)
- Luke 5:2 — "two ships standing by the lake" (same physical lake)
- Luke 8:22 — "Let us go over unto the other side of the lake"
- Luke 8:33 — "ran violently down a steep place into the lake"
- **Revelation 19:20** — "cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone"
- **Revelation 20:10** — "cast into the lake of fire and brimstone"
- **Revelation 20:14** — "death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
- **Revelation 20:15** — "was cast into the lake of fire"
- **Revelation 21:8** — "the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death"

**Note:** The first 4 uses (all in Luke) refer to the physical Lake of Gennesaret. All 5 Revelation uses refer exclusively to the lake of fire. The word is not used for Hades, Sheol, Gehenna, or any other eschatological location — only the lake of fire in these five specific passages.

**Missing from Lexicon entry:** The BLB outline lists Rev 20:14 as the last occurrence but the tool lists 10 total; the five Revelation uses are 19:20, 20:10, 20:14, 20:15, and 21:8 (the tool's count matches 5 Luke + 5 Revelation = 10).

## G2288 — θάνατος (thanatos) — Death

**Transliteration:** thanatos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 119 occurrences (97 per translation tool)
**Definition:** death (literally or figuratively); from the verb thnēskō (to die)

### Translations (from search_strongs.py)
- "death" — 55 uses (56.7%)
- "of death" — 26 uses (26.8%)
- "the death" — 5 uses (5.2%)
- "to death" — 3 uses (3.1%)
- "deadly" — 2 uses (2.1%)
- And various minor forms

### Key Contextual Distribution
- **Paul's epistles (Romans, 1 Cor, 2 Cor, Phil, Col, 2 Tim):** Used consistently as the antithesis of life/eternal life. Death and zoe (life) are opposites, not two modes of existence.
- **Hebrews:** Used for Christ's death (Heb 2:9,14,15) and the power of death the devil held
- **Revelation:** Personified as "Death" (Rev 6:8: "his name was Death"); as the second death (Rev 2:11; 20:6; 20:13,14; 21:4,8)

### Revelation-Specific Uses of G2288
| Reference | Usage | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Rev 1:18 | "keys of hell and of death" | Christ holds authority |
| Rev 2:10 | "be thou faithful unto death" | Physical death context |
| Rev 2:11 | "not be hurt of the second death" | Second death = harm |
| Rev 2:23 | "kill her children with death" | Judgment formula |
| Rev 6:8 | "his name was Death" | Personified as rider |
| Rev 9:6 | "men shall seek death" | Desired death context |
| Rev 12:11 | "loved not their lives unto the death" | Martyrdom |
| Rev 13:3 | "as it were wounded to death" | Mortal wound |
| Rev 13:12 | "deadly wound was healed" | Same |
| Rev 18:8 | "death, and mourning, and famine" | Babylon's judgment |
| Rev 20:6 | "second death hath no power" | Exemption statement |
| Rev 20:13 | "death and hell delivered up the dead" | Pre-judgment |
| Rev 20:14 | "death and hell cast into lake — this IS the second death" | Definition |
| Rev 20:14 | (second instance in same verse) | Lake of fire = second death |
| Rev 21:4 | "no more death" | New creation |
| Rev 21:8 | "which is the second death" | Second death = lake |

**Key observation:** G2288 (thanatos) is used for the "second death" in Rev 2:11; 20:6; 20:14; 21:8. The word is the standard Greek word for death — cessation of life. The "second death" uses the same word (thanatos) with the ordinal "second" (deuteros). The text does not use a different word for the second death vs. the first death — it is the same word with a qualifier.

## G1208 — δεύτερος (deuteros) — Second

**Transliteration:** deuteros
**Part of Speech:** adjective
**BLB Count:** 43 occurrences
**Definition:** second (in order, time, or rank)

### Translations
- "second" — 24 uses (55.8%)
- Various forms of "second time" — 10 uses
- "again" — 2 uses
- "secondarily" — 1 use

### "Second Death" Compound Occurrences
In Revelation, G1208 (deuteros) + G2288 (thanatos) appear together in:
- Rev 2:11 — "the second death" (not hurt)
- Rev 20:6 — "the second death" (no power)
- Rev 20:14 — "the second death" (definition: this IS)
- Rev 21:8 — "the second death" (which IS)

**Greek Parsing of "Second Death" Compounds:**
- Rev 20:14: "ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός" — nominative singular masculine (the death the second) — predicate nominative after ἐστιν (is)
- Rev 20:6: "ὁ δεύτερος θάνατος" — nominative singular masculine (the second death) — subject
- Rev 21:8: "ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος" — nominative singular masculine (the death the second) — predicate nominative after ἐστιν (is)

**Structure note:** In Rev 20:14 and 21:8, the "second death" is identified with the lake of fire through the copula ἐστιν (is) — "This IS the second death." The identification is an equative predicate nominative. The second death = the lake of fire. (N021 in master.)

## G2303 — θεῖον (theion) — Brimstone

**Transliteration:** theion
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun (n)
**BLB Count:** 7 occurrences
**Definition:** brimstone (sulfur)

### Translations
100% translated "brimstone" — no variation.

### All 7 NT Occurrences (all Revelation except one)
- Luke 17:29 — "brimstone" (fire and brimstone from heaven on Sodom — OT reference by Jesus)
- Rev 9:17 — "fire and smoke and brimstone" (the horsemen's breastplates)
- Rev 9:18 — "fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone" (the three plagues)
- Rev 14:10 — "tormented with fire and brimstone" (beast-worshippers — IB008)
- Rev 19:20 — "lake of fire burning with brimstone" (beast and false prophet)
- Rev 20:10 — "lake of fire and brimstone" (devil, beast, false prophet)
- Rev 21:8 — "lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death" (human wicked)

**Key observation:** Every NT use of "brimstone" (theion) is in a destruction/judgment context. All 6 Revelation uses are associated with divine judgment (5 with the lake of fire). The Sodom reference (Luke 17:29 citing Gen 19:24) points to complete destruction (Sodom became ashes — 2 Pet 2:6).

## G4442 — πῦρ (pyr) — Fire

**Transliteration:** pyr
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun (n)
**BLB Count:** 74 occurrences
**Definition:** fire (literally or figuratively)

### Translations
- "fire" — 37 uses (52.9%)
- "of fire" — 16 uses (22.9%)
- "with fire" — 8 uses (11.4%)
- "the fire" — 5 uses (7.1%)
- Various minor forms

### Relevant Eschatological Uses
**Judgment/destruction contexts:**
- Mat 3:10; 7:19 — trees not bearing fruit "hewn down, and cast into the fire"
- Mat 13:40,42,50 — tares gathered and burned; furnace of fire
- Mat 18:8,9 — cast into everlasting fire / fire of hell
- Mat 25:41 — everlasting fire prepared for devil and his angels
- 2 Th 1:8 — "in flaming fire taking vengeance"
- Heb 10:27 — "fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries"
- Jude 1:7 — eternal fire (Sodom's example)
- 2 Pet 3:7 — heavens and earth reserved for fire (judgment)

**Revelation judgment uses of pyr:**
- Rev 8:7,8 — hail/fire; mountain of fire
- Rev 9:17,18 — fire, smoke, brimstone
- Rev 14:10 — tormented with fire and brimstone
- Rev 17:16 — burn the harlot with fire
- Rev 18:8 — Babylon burned with fire
- Rev 19:20 — lake of fire (G3041 + G4442)
- Rev 20:9 — fire came down and devoured (nations/armies)
- Rev 20:10 — lake of fire and brimstone
- Rev 20:14 — lake of fire = second death
- Rev 20:15 — lake of fire
- Rev 21:8 — lake burning with fire and brimstone = second death

**Key observation:** In Rev 20:9 (one verse before the lake-of-fire passages), fire "devoured" (katephagen — G2719, to eat up/consume) the nations/human armies. The fire of Rev 20:9 consumes; the lake of fire of Rev 20:10,14,15 is where the named entities are cast. The fire motif throughout Revelation is primarily destruction/consumption, not merely illumination or pain.

## H4194 — מָוֶת (mavet) — Death (Hebrew)

**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 167 occurrences
**Definition:** death, dying, the dead; personified as Mot (Canaanite death deity parallel)

### Translation Distribution
- "of death" — 26 uses (15.6%)
- "death" — 22 uses (13.2%)
- "the death" — 20 uses (12.0%)
- "from death" — 10 uses (6.0%)
- Various minor forms

### Key Uses Related to This Study
- **Hos 13:14:** "I will redeem them from death (mavet): O death (mavet), I will be thy plagues" — Death addressed as a power to be defeated. The LXX uses G2288 (thanatos) here — same word Paul quotes in 1 Cor 15:55.
- **Isa 25:8:** "He will swallow up death (mavet) in victory" — LXX: katepien ho thanatos ischysas (swallowed up death in strength). Paul quotes this with "death was swallowed up into victory" (1 Cor 15:54).
- **Psa 6:5; 18:5; 116:3** — Death as a realm of experience/encounter

**LXX Connection:** H4194 (mavet) is translated by G2288 (thanatos) in the LXX. Paul's use of the same Greek word in 1 Cor 15 and throughout Romans is linguistically continuous with the OT death vocabulary. When Paul says "death is swallowed up" (1 Cor 15:54) and "the second death" appears in Revelation, they share the same Greek word (thanatos).

## G2673 — καταργέω (katargeō) — To Abolish/Render Inoperative

**Transliteration:** katargeō
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** to render inoperative, to abolish, to bring to naught, to do away with

### Uses Relevant to This Study
- **1 Cor 15:24:** "when he shall have put down (katargeō) all rule and all authority and power"
- **1 Cor 15:26:** "the last enemy that shall be destroyed (katargeō) is death" — Present Passive Indicative (katageitai) — futuristic present
- **2 Tim 1:10:** "who hath abolished (katargeō) death" — Aorist Active Participle (katargēsantos)
- **Heb 2:14:** "that he might destroy (katargeō) him that had the power of death" — Aorist Active Subjunctive in purpose clause

**Key parsing note from this study:**
- 1 Cor 15:26: katageitai — Present Passive Indicative 3rd Singular. Death "is being abolished" — the process is already underway from Christ's resurrection; completion at the final resurrection.
- The word katargeō appears 27 times in Paul's letters. It means to make ineffective, to bring to nothing, to put out of operation. It is stronger than "neutralize" but does not specify whether the referent is annihilated or merely de-powered. In 1 Cor 15:24-26, it is used for: all rule/authority/power being put down; then death being destroyed. The scope of 1 Cor 15:24-28 is the complete subjugation of all enemies including death itself.

## G2666 — καταπίνω (katapinō) — To Swallow Up/Down

**Transliteration:** katapinō
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** to drink down, swallow up, devour completely

### Key Use: 1 Cor 15:54
- "Κατεπόθη ὁ θάνατος εἰς νῖκος" — Death was swallowed up into victory
- **Parsing:** Aorist Passive Indicative 3rd Singular — proleptic Aorist describing a future certain event as completed
- This quotes Isa 25:8 (Hebrew: billa = swallow up/destroy completely; same root used of Hades swallowing nations in Isa 5:14)

**Note:** katapinō in the NT is used for:
- Being drowned/swallowed by the sea (Matt 23:24 — strain at a gnat; Rev 12:16 — earth swallowed the flood)
- Swallowing something down (Heb 11:29 — Egyptians swallowed by the sea)
- Death being "swallowed up" in victory (1 Cor 15:54)
- The mortal being "swallowed up" by life (2 Cor 5:4)

The word in 1 Cor 15:54 describes Death itself as being consumed/devoured. Death is not transformed — it is swallowed up and ended.
