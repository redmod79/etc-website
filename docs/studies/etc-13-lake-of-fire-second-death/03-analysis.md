# Analysis — Lake of Fire / Second Death

## 1. The Identification Statement: "The Lake of Fire IS the Second Death" (Rev 20:14)

Rev 20:14 states: "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."

The Greek construction is a definitional predicate nominative: houtos ho thanatos ho deuteros estin, he limne tou puros — "This is the second death." The demonstrative pronoun "this" (houtos) refers to what was just described (death and hades cast into the lake of fire), and the predicate nominative identifies it as "the second death."

This is not a metaphor, simile, or analogy. It is a direct identification: the lake of fire = the second death. The text provides its own name for what the lake of fire does. The author chooses thanatos (death) vocabulary, not basanizo (torment) vocabulary, to identify the lake of fire's function.

Rev 21:8 repeats the identification: "shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." Here the relative pronoun "which" (ho estin) explicitly equates the lake of fire with the second death. In both instances, the text's own term for the experience of the lake is death — specifically, a second death.

## 2. What Is Being Cast Into the Lake?

The text identifies five categories of subjects cast into the lake of fire:

### a. The Beast and False Prophet (Rev 19:20)
Cast "alive" (zontes) into the lake of fire. These are symbolic apocalyptic entities (etc-12: E205, E387). The beast rises from the sea with seven heads and ten horns (Rev 13:1); the false prophet is the second beast of Rev 13:11-17. *(Examined in depth in etc-12.)*

### b. The Devil (Rev 20:10)
Cast into the lake of fire "where the beast and the false prophet are." The devil is a non-human supernatural spirit being (etc-12: E375). The torment formula ("tormented day and night for ever and ever") is applied to these three entities. *(Examined in depth in etc-12.)*

### c. Death and Hades (Rev 20:14)
"Death and hell [hades] were cast into the lake of fire." Death (thanatos, G2288) and hades (G86) are personified throughout Revelation. In Rev 6:8, Death rides a pale horse and Hades follows. In Rev 20:13, death and hades deliver up the dead. Now they are themselves cast into the lake of fire.

This is the destruction of death itself. Death and hades are not persons. They are conditions or realms. Casting them into the lake of fire means they cease to exist — there is no more death. The immediate context confirms this: Rev 21:4 states "there shall be no more death."

This parallels directly:
- 1 Cor 15:26: "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."
- Isa 25:8: "He will swallow up death in victory."
- Hos 13:14: "O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction."
- 2 Tim 1:10: Christ "hath abolished death."

The vocabulary chain is consistent: destroy (katargeo, 1 Cor 15:26), swallow up (kata-pino, Isa 25:8 / 1 Cor 15:54), plagues/destruction (Hos 13:14), abolish (katargeo, 2 Tim 1:10). All are destruction/cessation vocabulary. When death and hades are cast into the lake of fire, the result described throughout Scripture is that death ceases to exist.

### d. Humans Not in the Book of Life (Rev 20:15)
"Whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." No torment formula is appended. The text immediately before (v.14) identified the lake of fire as "the second death." The text's own identification of what happens to humans in the lake is death — a second one.

### e. Eight Categories of Human Wicked (Rev 21:8)
"The fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." Again, the text identifies the experience as "the second death" — death vocabulary.

## 3. The "Second Death" as Explanation

The phrase "second death" (deuteros thanatos) occurs four times in Revelation and nowhere else in Scripture:

| Verse | Statement | Function |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Rev 2:11 | Overcomers "shall not be hurt of the second death" | Promise of exemption |
| Rev 20:6 | "Second death hath no power" over first resurrection participants | Declaration of exemption |
| Rev 20:14 | "This is the second death" | Definitional identification of the lake |
| Rev 21:8 | "which is the second death" | Definitional identification of the lake |

The term functions as the text's own explanation of what the lake of fire does. The lake of fire is not an independent concept requiring external definition. The text defines it: it is the second death.

The adjective "second" (deuteros) implies a sequence: there is a first death (physical death, experienced by all) and a second death (experienced only by those not in the book of life). Rev 20:5-6 makes this explicit by paralleling the first resurrection with the second death: those in the first resurrection are exempt from the second death.

## 4. Rev 2:11 and Rev 20:6 — Overcomers and the Second Death

**Rev 2:11:** "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death." The verb "hurt" (adikeo, G91) means to wrong, injure, or harm. The overcomer is promised not merely survival through the second death but exemption from it — the second death will not harm them at all.

**Rev 20:6:** "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power." The word "power" is exousia (G1849) — authority, jurisdiction, right. The second death has no authority over those in the first resurrection. This language treats the second death as a power or force that exercises jurisdiction — consistent with death terminology (death exercises dominion, Rom 5:14,17; death reigns, Rom 5:14).

Both passages treat the second death as something that exercises power and causes harm — consistent with death language. Neither passage describes the second death as conscious torment from which overcomers are exempt. The promise is that overcomers will not die a second time.

## 5. The Vocabulary Pattern Across Rev 19:20-21:8

The text maintains a consistent vocabulary pattern when describing different subjects at the lake of fire:

| Subject | Verse | Vocabulary | Type |
|---------|-------|-----------|------|
| Beast, false prophet | Rev 19:20 | "cast alive" (zontes) | Symbolic entities |
| Human remnant | Rev 19:21 | "slain" (apektanthesan) | Humans — death |
| Human armies | Rev 20:9 | "devoured" (katephagen) | Humans — destruction |
| Devil, beast, false prophet | Rev 20:10 | "tormented day and night for ever and ever" | Non-human/symbolic |
| Death and hades | Rev 20:14 | "cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death" | Personified conditions — destroyed |
| Humans not in book of life | Rev 20:15 | "cast into the lake of fire" (no torment formula) | Humans — second death |
| Eight categories of wicked | Rev 21:8 | "the lake... which is the second death" | Humans — second death |

The pattern: when the subject is a non-human/symbolic entity (devil, beast, false prophet), the text uses torment vocabulary. When the subject is human, the text uses death/destruction vocabulary (slain, devoured, second death). When the subject is a personified condition (death, hades), the result is cessation — "no more death" (Rev 21:4).

## 6. Relationship to Matt 25:41

Matt 25:41: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."

This passage states the everlasting fire was "prepared for the devil and his angels" — its primary designation is for non-human entities. Humans are sent there, but the fire was prepared for supernatural beings.

The punishment vocabulary for humans in the immediate context (Matt 25:46) is kolasis (punishment), not basanizo (torment). *(Examined in depth in etc-08 and etc-12.)* The everlasting fire and the lake of fire share the destination of the devil, but Matt 25:41 does not identify what happens to humans in that fire — it states the destination. Rev 20:14 and 21:8 identify the result for humans: "the second death."

## 7. Rev 21:4 and the Elimination of Death

Rev 21:4 states: "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."

This verse appears in the immediate context after the lake of fire passages. The "no more death" statement is the positive counterpart to what Rev 20:14 describes negatively: death itself has been cast into the lake of fire and destroyed. The casting of death into the lake achieves the state described in Rev 21:4 — a world where death no longer exists.

This parallels 1 Cor 15:26 ("the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death") and 1 Cor 15:54 ("death is swallowed up in victory"). The imagery is consistent: death is destroyed, swallowed up, cast into the lake — and the result is the same: death is no more.

## 8. G3041 (limne) Distribution

The word limne occurs 10 times in the NT. Five occurrences in Luke refer to the literal Lake of Gennesaret. Five occurrences in Revelation refer to the "lake of fire." The concept of a "lake of fire" is unique to Revelation's apocalyptic framework. It does not appear in the OT, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, or John, the Epistles, or any other NT writing. This is consistent with Revelation's use of distinctive symbolic imagery (semaino, Rev 1:1) to communicate through signs.

## 9. Nave's Classification

Nave's classifies:
- SECOND DEATH: Only Rev 20:14, cross-referenced to WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF
- LAKE: "Of fire" — Rev 19:20; 20:10,14,15; 21:8
- FIRE — "Of the destruction of the wicked": MAT 13:42,50; 25:41; MRK 9:44; REV 9:2; 21:8
- FIRE — EVERLASTING FIRE: classified under FIGURATIVE

Nave's classification places fire-judgment of the wicked under "destruction" language and classifies everlasting fire as figurative.
