## Key Observations

1. Nave's classifies "lake of fire" under LAKE with five Revelation references only -- the concept does not appear outside Revelation.

2. Nave's SECOND DEATH entry points only to Rev 20:14 and cross-references WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF.

3. Nave's DEATH - SECOND subcategory lists a wide range of verses using death/destruction vocabulary for the fate of the wicked (Ezek 18:4; Matt 10:28; Rom 6:23; 2 Thess 1:9; etc.), indicating Nave's treats "second death" as connected to the broader death-as-judgment theme.

4. Nave's classifies fire in judgment as "Of the destruction of the wicked" and everlasting fire as FIGURATIVE.

5. G3041 (limne) occurs 10 times in NT: 5 literal uses in Luke (Lake of Gennesaret), 5 uses for "lake of fire" in Revelation. The word simply means "lake/pond" -- a body of water.
