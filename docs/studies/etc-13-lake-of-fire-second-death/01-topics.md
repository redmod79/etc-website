## Study: etc5-13 — The Lake of Fire and the Second Death
## Series: ETC5 — The Final Fate of the Wicked (Study 13 of 18)

## Question
What is the "lake of fire" in Revelation? What is the "second death"? Who are cast into the lake of fire? What does the "second death" language tell us about the nature of the final fate of the wicked? Is the lake of fire a place of ongoing conscious torment, or does the "second death" describe final destruction/annihilation?

## Topics

### LAKE (Nave's)
Nave's entry [Score: 0.56]:
- Of fire: REV 19:20; 20:10, 14, 15; 21:8

*Notes: Nave's LAKE entry is minimal — entirely defined by its Revelation occurrences. The "lake of fire" is a Revelation-specific term with no direct OT parallel named in Nave's.*

---

### SECOND DEATH (Nave's)
Nave's entry [Score: 0.50]:
- General scriptures concerning: REV 20:14
- See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

*Notes: Nave's entry for "Second Death" points to a single verse (Rev 20:14) as the definitive text. The cross-reference to WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF is the broader category.*

---

### BRIMSTONE (Nave's)
Nave's entry [Score: 0.67]:
- Fire and, rained upon Sodom: GEN 19:24; LUK 17:29
- In Palestine: DEU 29:23
- FIGURATIVE: JOB 18:15; PSA 11:6; ISA 30:33; EZK 38:22; REV 9:17,18; 14:10; 19:20; 21:8

*Notes: Brimstone in the figurative category is associated with divine judgment and destruction (Sodom, Ezekiel 38, Revelation). The figurative Revelation uses (9:17,18; 14:10; 19:20; 21:8) are all in judgment contexts.*

### HADES (Nave's)
Nave's entry [Score: 0.40]:
1. The unseen world (translated "hell" in AV; "Hades" in RV): MAT 10:28; 11:23; 16:18; LUK 10:15; 16:23; ACT 2:27,31; REV 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14
   - See HELL
2. The realm (state) of the dead: 2SA 22:6; JOB 26:5; PSA 6:5; 17:15; 30:9; 49:15; 86:13; 88:10-12; 115:17; 116:3; PRO 15:24; 21:16; 27:20; ECC 9:4-6; ISA 5:14; JON 2:2; LUK 23:42,43; JHN 8:22; 2CO 12:4

*Notes: Hades appears both as the unseen world (temporary holding state) and as the realm of the dead broadly. The REV 20:13,14 reference is critical — Hades gives up the dead and is then cast into the lake of fire. This is consistent with the "temporary" nature of Hades.*

### DEATH — SECOND category (from Nave's full-text search)
From the DEATH entry, subtopic "SECOND":
- PRO 14:12; EZK 18:4,10,13,21,23,24; 33:8,9,11,14-16; MAT 7:13; 10:28; 25:30,41,46; MRK 9:43,44; ROM 1:32; 6:16,21,23; 8:13; 9:22; 2TH 1:9; JAS 1:15; 4:12; 2PE 2:12; REV 2:11; 19:20; 20:14; 21:8
- See HELL; See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

*Notes: Nave's groups the second death category with destruction/punishment verses from multiple books. This demonstrates that Nave's itself understood the "second death" in connection with the broader theme of what happens to the wicked — linking it to destruction vocabulary (apollymi), everlasting destruction, and the fire passages.*

---

### DEATH — Apostrophe To (from Nave's DEATH entry)
- HOS 13:14; 1CO 15:55

*Notes: Both passages where Death is directly addressed/apostrophized as a power that will be defeated. Hosea 13:14 is the OT source; 1 Cor 15:55 is Paul's application of the same apostrophe.*
