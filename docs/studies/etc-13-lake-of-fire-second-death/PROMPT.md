# Bible Study: Lake of Fire / Second Death (etc-13)

## Question
Lake of fire in Revelation. "Second death" (Rev 2:11; 20:6,14; 21:8). Rev 20:14 ("lake of fire IS the second death"). Death/hell cast into lake (Rev 20:14). What is the lake of fire? What is the second death? What does it mean that Rev 20:14 identifies the lake of fire AS the second death? What does it mean that death and hades are cast into the lake of fire? Who are the subjects who enter the lake? What do Rev 2:11 and 20:6 say about overcomers and the second death? How does the "second death" function as the text's own explanation of what the lake does?

| Study | Question | Relevance |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| etc-12-tormented-forever | Rev 20:10 subjects, basanizo range, vocabulary differentiation | Directly establishes that "tormented for ever" applies to devil/beast/false prophet (non-human/symbolic), while humans get "devoured" (v.9) and "second death" (vv.14-15; 21:8) |
| etc-11-smoke-ascending-forever | Rev 14:9-11, fire/brimstone OT paradigm | OT fire-and-brimstone = destructive judgment with permanent result |
| etc-05-sheol-hades-gehenna | Sheol, hades, gehenna, lake of fire relationships | Hades cast into lake of fire (Rev 20:14) |

| etc-06-destruction-words | apollymi, olethros, apoleia, phthora | Destruction vocabulary for human fate |

### Key findings from prior studies:
- etc-12: Rev 20:10 "tormented for ever and ever" applies only to devil, beast, false prophet (non-human/symbolic). When humans enter the lake (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8), the text uses "second death," not "torment." The "tormented for ever and ever" formula appears once in Scripture, applied only to these three entities.
- etc-11: OT fire-and-brimstone paradigm = destruction with permanent aftermath. "Smoke ascending for ever" formula in OT (Isa 34:10) = permanent desolation.
- etc-03: "Second death" identified as inference item I020 (ECT: involves eternal conscious torment) and I017 (Cond: means permanent end of the wicked).

### Focus Areas
1. Rev 20:14 identification statement: "the lake of fire IS the second death" -- what does this definitional equation mean?
2. Death and hades cast into the lake -- destruction of death itself; relationship to 1 Cor 15:26, Isa 25:8
3. All subjects who enter the lake: beast/false prophet (Rev 19:20), devil (Rev 20:10), death/hades (Rev 20:14), humans not in book of life (Rev 20:15), eight categories of wicked (Rev 21:8)
4. Rev 2:11 and 20:6 -- overcomers "not hurt" by second death; second death has no "power" (exousia) over first resurrection participants
5. The "second death" as the text's own explanation of what the lake does to its subjects
6. Relationship to Matt 25:41 (everlasting fire prepared for devil and his angels)
7. G3041 (limne) distribution: 5 literal lake uses in Luke, 5 "lake of fire" uses in Revelation
