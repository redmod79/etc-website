## 1. Question

What is the "lake of fire" in Revelation? What is the "second death"? Who are cast into the lake of fire? What does the "second death" language tell us about the nature of the final fate of the wicked? Is the lake of fire a place of ongoing conscious torment, or does the "second death" describe final destruction/annihilation?

---

## 2. Summary Answer

The text states:

1. The lake of fire is explicitly identified as "the second death" by the author of Revelation in two separate definitional equations (Rev 20:14; 21:8), using the equative copula ἐστιν ("is") in each case.

2. The five lake-of-fire passages involve four distinct groups of subjects: (a) two named supernatural entities cast alive — beast and false prophet (Rev 19:20); (b) the devil cast in with torment-for-ever formula (Rev 20:10); (c) Death and Hades as personified abstractions (Rev 20:14); (d) all human wicked not in the book of life (Rev 20:15; 21:8).

3. The explicit torment language ("tormented day and night for ever and ever") is applied only to the three named supernatural entities in Rev 20:10. It is not applied to human wicked in Rev 20:15 or Rev 21:8.

4. The "second death" uses the standard Greek word for death (θάνατος, G2288) — the same word Paul uses for the "last enemy to be destroyed" (1 Cor 15:26), for what God will "swallow up" (1 Cor 15:54 quoting Isa 25:8), and for what Christ "abolished" (2 Tim 1:10).

5. First-resurrection participants are explicitly exempt from the second death, which is stated to have "no authority" (exousia) over them (Rev 20:6).

6. The abolition of Death personified in Rev 20:14 corresponds to the fulfillment of 1 Cor 15:26 and enables the "no more death" promise of Rev 21:4.

## 4. Full Analysis

### A. The Five Lake-of-Fire Passages and Their Subjects

The word λίμνη (limnē, G3041) appears 5 times in Revelation, all referring to the lake of fire. Each passage involves distinct subjects:

| Passage | Subject | Torment Formula? | Second Death Label? |
|---------|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Rev 19:20 | Beast + False Prophet | No | No |
| Rev 20:10 | Devil (+ all three confirmed there) | Yes — "day and night for ever and ever" | No |
| Rev 20:14 | Death + Hades (personified powers) | No | Yes — "THIS IS the second death" |
| Rev 20:15 | All human wicked (not in book of life) | No | No (implied by v.14) |
| Rev 21:8 | Eight categories of human wicked | No | Yes — "which IS the second death" |

The torment-for-ever language (explicit: Rev 20:10) and the second-death identification (explicit: Rev 20:14; 21:8) are applied to different subjects in Revelation's own text. No verse applies both labels to the same subject simultaneously. This distributional fact is the foundation for IB008's resolution (Moderate weight AGAINST universal extension of torment language).

### B. The Grammatical Structure of "The Second Death IS"

Both definitional equations use the equative copula ἐστιν in the same pattern used by Rev 20:5 ("This IS the first resurrection"):

- **Rev 20:14:** "οὗτος ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός ἐστιν, ἡ λίμνη τοῦ πυρός" — predicate nominative: "this IS the second death, the lake of the fire."
- **Rev 21:8:** "ὅ ἐστιν ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος" — relative clause: "which IS the second death."

This is Revelation's own definition of its own terminology. The author does not require an interpreter to identify what the second death is — he identifies it himself with an explicit equative statement in two independent passages.

### C. The Name "Death" and Its Cross-Testament Significance

The second death uses θάνατος (G2288) — the standard Greek word for death, not a specialized term for torment. This word:

- Is the "last enemy" to be abolished (1 Cor 15:26: καταργεῖται — Present Passive Indicative, futuristic)
- Is what God will "swallow up" at the resurrection (1 Cor 15:54: Κατεπόθη — proleptic Aorist from Isa 25:8)
- Is what Christ "abolished" through the Incarnation (2 Tim 1:10: katargeō — Aorist Active Participle)
- Is what the devil "had the power of" and Christ destroyed (Heb 2:14: katargeō — Aorist Active Subjunctive)
- Is what the new creation has "no more" of (Rev 21:4: θάνατος)

H4194 (mavet) in Hebrew maps to G2288 (thanatos) in the LXX (confirmed in Hos 13:14 and Isa 25:8). The cross-testament terminological unity means: when Paul speaks of death as the last enemy, when Revelation speaks of the second death, and when Isaiah speaks of God swallowing up death — all share the same word-family from Hebrew through LXX into NT Greek.

### D. Death as Last Enemy — The 1 Cor 15 / Rev 20:14 Connection

1 Corinthians 15:26 states: "The last enemy that shall be destroyed (καταργεῖται) is death." The Present Passive Indicative form (katageitai) is futuristic — the destruction of death is certain and has begun at Christ's resurrection, but is completed at the final resurrection.

Revelation 20:13-14 narratively executes this:
- Death and Hades deliver up their dead (v.13)
- Death and Hades are cast into the lake of fire (v.14) — identified as the second death

The result in Rev 21:4: "there shall be no more death." The sequence — 1 Cor 15:26 (abolition of death announced as last eschatological act) → Rev 20:14 (death cast into lake/second death = executed) → Rev 21:4 (no more death = result) — traces the fulfillment of the same event across two NT books.

The irony of Rev 20:14 is textual and structural: Death, the last enemy, is abolished by being cast into the second death. The power of death is destroyed through death.

### E. Death and Hades: Powers, Not Persons

The subjects of Rev 20:14's casting event are abstractions personified:
- **Rev 1:18:** Christ holds "the keys of hell and of death" — these are powers over which authority is exercised
- **Rev 6:8:** Death rides a pale horse, Hades follows — explicit personification of abstract realities
- **Rev 20:13:** They "delivered up" their dead — they are containers/holders of the dead

When Death and Hades are cast into the lake of fire in Rev 20:14, what is cast is the power/reality of death and the reality of the intermediate holding state. N026 (established etc5-05) describes this sequence: Hades holds → releases at judgment → is itself abolished. The lake of fire is what abolishes both.

### F. Brimstone Typology — Sodom Pattern

G2303 (theion/brimstone) in the NT appears 7 times: 6 times in Revelation (all judgment contexts) + Luke 17:29 (Jesus citing Sodom). Sodom is explicitly the type:

- Jude 1:7: Sodom suffered "the vengeance of eternal fire" (πυρὸς αἰωνίου)
- 2 Pet 2:6: Sodom was "turned to ashes" (tephroō = reduced to ash)

N029 (established etc5-05): eternal fire on Sodom produced ashes — the "eternal" character refers to permanent result, not ongoing burning. The brimstone signature in the lake-of-fire passages carries the Sodom type into the eschatological context.

Rev 20:9 (immediately before the lake passages) depicts human armies being "devoured" (κατέφαγεν — consumed/eaten up) by fire. The consumption vocabulary in v.9 distinguishes the fire's action on human armies from the torment vocabulary of v.10 for the three supernatural entities.

### G. Overcomer Exemption and the Antithesis

The exemption passages establish what first-resurrection participants are protected from:
- **Rev 2:11:** "shall not be hurt (adikēthē — aorist passive subjunctive: shall not be wronged/injured) of the second death"
- **Rev 20:6:** "the second death hath no power (exousia = authority/jurisdiction)" over them

The antithesis of Rev 21:7-8 — inherit all things (overcomers) vs. portion in the lake/second death (wicked) — is the sharpest structural presentation of the two eschatological outcomes in Revelation. Both use the same "death" vocabulary (Rev 21:4's "no more death" / Rev 21:8's "second death") within the same literary unit.

| Master ID | Explicit Statement | Reference | Classification |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| E262 | 1 Corinthians 15:26 identifies death as "the last enemy" to be abolished (καταργεῖται); Revelation 20:14 narrates Death personified being cast into the lake of fire; Revelation 21:4 declares "no more death" immediately after. These three texts trace the same event: announcement (1 Cor 15:26) → execution (Rev 20:14) → result (Rev 21:4). | 1 Cor 15:26; Rev 20:14; Rev 21:4 | Conditionalist |
| E263 | The subjects cast into the lake of fire in Rev 20:14 — θάνατος (death) and Ἅιδης (Hades) — are abstract powers personified throughout Revelation, not conscious persons. (Rev 1:18: Christ holds their keys; Rev 6:8: Death rides a horse, Hades follows.) The casting of abstractions into the lake occurs in the same narrative as the casting of human persons (Rev 20:15). | Rev 20:14; Rev 1:18; Rev 6:8 | Neutral |
| E264 | Revelation 21:4 states "there shall be no more death (θάνατος)." Revelation 21:8 — four verses later in the same literary unit — identifies the lake as "the second death (ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος)." The same word θάνατος (G2288) appears in both verses in immediate literary proximity: the first as the redeemed's promise, the second as the wicked's fate. | Rev 21:4; Rev 21:8 | Neutral |
| E265 | Revelation 21:7 states overcomers "shall inherit all things" (κληρονομήσει — future active). Revelation 21:8 states the wicked "shall have their part (τὸ μέρος αὐτῶν) in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." Consecutive verses present the two outcomes as antithesis: inheritance vs. portion-in-the-second-death. No intermediate state is described. | Rev 21:7-8 | Neutral |
| E266 | The word λίμνη (lake, G3041) appears 10 times in the NT: 4 uses for the physical Lake of Gennesaret (Luke 5:1,2; 8:22,33) and 5 uses exclusively for the lake of fire in Revelation (Rev 19:20; 20:10,14,15; 21:8). It is never used for Hades, Sheol, Gehenna, or any other eschatological location. | Rev 19:20; 20:10,14,15; 21:8; Luke 5:1,2; 8:22,33 | Neutral |
| E267 | Revelation 19:20–20:15 records four distinct casting events: (1) Rev 19:20 — beast and false prophet cast alive (ζῶντες); (2) Rev 20:10 — devil cast in, all three tormented for ever; (3) Rev 20:14 — Death and Hades cast in = second death; (4) Rev 20:15 — all not in book of life cast in. Each event has a distinct grammatical subject; the torment-for-ever formula is applied only in (2); the second-death identification is applied only in (3) with definitional carry-forward. | Rev 19:20; 20:10; 20:14; 20:15 | Neutral |

## 8. Conclusion

The text of Revelation provides two explicit equative identifications of the second death (Rev 20:14; 21:8), both using the Present Indicative copula (ἐστιν = "is"). The second death is the lake of fire. This is the book's own definition, stated twice in independent passages.

The word used for the second death — θάνατος (thanatos, G2288) — is the standard Greek word for death throughout the NT. It is the word 1 Corinthians 15:26 identifies as "the last enemy" to be abolished, the word Revelation 21:4 declares will exist "no more" in the new creation, and the word Paul quotes from Isaiah 25:8 ("Death was swallowed up in victory"). The second death uses this word, not the torment vocabulary (basanizō/basanismos).

The five lake-of-fire passages in Revelation distribute their subjects and their vocabulary distinctly. The explicit torment-for-ever formula (Rev 20:10) is applied to three named supernatural entities; it is not applied to human wicked in the adjacent verses (Rev 20:15; 21:8). The "second death" identification (Rev 20:14; 21:8) is applied to the fate of human wicked and to the personified powers of Death and Hades; it is not applied to the three supernatural entities. Revelation's own text differentiates its subjects and its labels.

The first-resurrection exemption from the second death (Rev 2:11; 20:6) treats the second death as an entity with real authority over those subject to it — from which overcomers are completely released. The antithesis of Rev 21:7-8 (inherit all things vs. portion in the second death) places the second death at the opposite pole from eternal inheritance, parallel to the death/life antithesis throughout Paul and John.

The Death-and-Hades pairing throughout Revelation (Rev 1:18; 6:8; 20:13-14) treats these as personified powers that are real in the current age, temporary in scope (Hades releases its dead at judgment), and abolished at the lake of fire. The abolition of Death in Rev 20:14 is the narrative fulfillment of 1 Corinthians 15:26 and the precondition for Revelation 21:4.

The key contested question — whether the lake of fire represents ongoing conscious torment or final destruction — centers on the vocabulary distribution observed above. The explicit evidence classifies as follows: the second death is explicitly named "death"; the torment formula is explicitly applied to three named supernatural entities; human wicked are explicitly cast into the lake without the torment formula. Each of these is a textual observation both positions must acknowledge. What those observations mean for the nature of the experience in the lake is where the interpretive divide operates.
