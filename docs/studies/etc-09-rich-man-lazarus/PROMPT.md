# Research Agent Prompt: etc-09 -- Rich Man and Lazarus

## Study Question
Luke 16:19-31 -- parable or literal? Genre, first-century Jewish context. Apply Tree 3 genre gate. Literary structure (five parables in Luke 15-16).

## Series Context
This is study etc-09 in the etc series (The Final Fate of the Wicked). Prior studies (etc-01 through etc-08) have produced 431 evidence items. This study is a dedicated genre and literary analysis of Luke 16:19-31 (the Rich Man and Lazarus), which was briefly analyzed in etc-04 (E155/I025) and etc-05 (E155/I032). This study provides the in-depth investigation.

**Do NOT reference etc-01-what-is-man (deleted).**

### Prior Study Findings (Read from CONCLUSION.md files)

**etc-04 (State of the Dead) -- initial classification of Luke 16:19-31:**
Luke 16:19-31 was registered as E155 (Neutral): "In a parable, the rich man is depicted in hades in torments; Lazarus in Abraham's bosom; the point: 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.'" The passage failed Tree 3 Gates 1 and 3 (subject is an allegorical character; genre is parabolic). Inference I025 (I-C, ECT-direction): "Luke 16:19-31 teaches the literal geography of the afterlife" was classified as requiring an external framework (treating parabolic imagery as literal afterlife geography). The study documented 19 explicit Conditionalist statements about the death-state (unconsciousness, silence, darkness) from 8+ OT authors across 6+ books. 0 explicit ECT statements were found in didactic passages. All alleged conscious intermediate-state passages (2 Cor 5:8, Phil 1:23, Luke 23:43, Luke 16:19-31, Rev 6:9-11, 1 Sam 28, Matt 17, 1 Pet 3:18-20) failed one or more Tree 3 gates.

**etc-05 (Four Hell Words) -- hades analysis and Luke 16 in context:**
Hades (G86, 11 NT occurrences) is the NT equivalent of sheol (confirmed by LXX translating sheol as hades 58/65 times and by Acts 2:27,31 directly quoting Ps 16:10). Didactic passages characterize sheol/hades by unconsciousness, silence, darkness, no work, no knowledge (Ecc 9:10; Ps 6:5; 115:17; Job 10:21-22). Only Luke 16:23 depicts consciousness in hades -- within a parable. Inference I032 (I-B, ECT-direction): "Sheol/hades is a place of conscious existence with compartments" was resolved Strong toward Conditionalist: 7 Plain didactic items on the AGAINST side vs. 3 Ambiguous items (1 parabolic, 1 mashal, 1 prophetic lamentation) on the FOR side.

**etc-01 (What Is Man?):** Man became a living soul (Gen 2:7). Death reverses creation: dust returns, spirit returns to God (Ecc 12:7). Thoughts perish at death (Ps 146:4). The dead know nothing (Ecc 9:5).

**etc-02 (Who Has Immortality?):** God alone has immortality (1 Tim 6:16). Immortality is acquired at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54). Eternal life is conditional.

**etc-03 (Biblical Death):** Death means cessation. The second death is the lake of fire (Rev 20:14). Death and life are exhaustive, mutually exclusive alternatives.

**etc-06 (Destruction Vocabulary):** Seven destruction words (~743 combined occurrences) form the Bible's primary vocabulary for the wicked's fate. No lexicon defines any as "torment."

**etc-07 (Olam/Forever in OT):** Olam does not inherently mean "eternal/endless." Duration depends on context and subject.

**etc-08 (Aionios/Forever in NT):** Aionios means "pertaining to the age" with duration determined by the nature of the subject. Past-time uses (Rom 16:25; 2 Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2) confirm it does not inherently mean "endless."

### Relevance to This Study
etc-04 classified Luke 16:19-31 as a parable (failing Tree 3 Gates 1 and 3) and registered the passage as E155 (Neutral). etc-05 resolved I032 (sheol/hades as conscious compartmentalized realm) Strong toward Conditionalist, with Luke 16:23 as one of three Ambiguous FOR items overruled by 7 Plain AGAINST items. This study provides the dedicated, in-depth investigation of Luke 16:19-31 that those studies cross-referenced. The question is: does the passage teach literal afterlife geography or is it a parable using familiar imagery to make a point about hearing Moses and the prophets?

**G931 (basanos) -- "torments" in Luke 16:23,28**
- Transliteration: basanos
- Pronunciation: bas
- Part of speech: masculine noun
- BLB Count: 3
- Strong's definition: perhaps remotely from the same as (through the notion of going to)
- KJV translations: "torments" (2x, 66.7%), "of torment" (1x, 33.3%)
- Biblical Usage: Matt 4:24; Luke 16:23; Luke 16:28

**G3600 (odunao) -- "tormented" in Luke 16:24,25**
- Transliteration: odunao
- Pronunciation: od-oo-nah
- Part of speech: verb
- BLB Count: 4
- Strong's definition: from; to grieve: sorrow, torment
- KJV translations: "sorrowing" (1x), "I am tormented" (1x), "art tormented" (1x), "Sorrowing" (1x)
- Biblical Usage: Luke 2:48; Luke 16:24; Acts 20:38
- NOTE: odunao means "to grieve/sorrow" -- a different word family from basanizo (G928). Luke 16 uses BOTH basanos (G931) and odunao (G3600), but NOT basanizo (G928, the standard "torment" verb used in Rev 14:10; 20:10).

**G928 (basanizo) -- standard NT "torment" verb (NOT used in Luke 16)**
- Transliteration: basanizo
- Pronunciation: bas-an-id
- Part of speech: verb
- BLB Count: 12
- Strong's definition: from; to torture: pain, toil, torment, toss, vex
- KJV translations: "tormented" (2x), "to torment" (1x), "tossed" (1x), "that thou torment" (1x), "toiling" (1x), "torment" (1x), "vexed" (1x), "they should be tormented" (1x), "pained" (1x), "he shall be tormented" (1x), "shall be tormented" (1x)
- Biblical Usage: Matt 8:6,29; 14:24; Mark 5:7; 6:48; Luke 8:28; 2 Pet 2:8; Rev 9:5; 11:10; 12:2; 14:10; 20:10
- KEY OBSERVATION: basanizo is the word used in Rev 14:10 and 20:10 for eschatological torment. It does NOT appear in Luke 16:19-31. The passage uses the milder basanos (noun) and odunao (grieve/sorrow) instead.

**G2859 (kolpos) -- "bosom" in Luke 16:22,23**
- Transliteration: kolpos
- Pronunciation: kol
- Part of speech: masculine noun
- BLB Count: 6 (in KJV concordance: 4 occurrences)
- Strong's definition: apparently a primary word; the bosom; by analogy, a bay: bosom, creek
- KJV translations: "bosom" (3x, 75%), "creek" (1x, 25%)
- Biblical Usage (NT): Luke 6:38; Luke 16:22,23; John 1:18; 13:23; Acts 27:39
- NOTE: "Abraham's bosom" as a location for the dead appears ONLY in Luke 16:22-23. John 1:18 uses kolpos for Jesus being "in the bosom of the Father" (intimate relationship, not geography). John 13:23 uses it for the disciple leaning on Jesus' bosom at supper. The geographical/locational use is unique to Luke 16.

**G3857 (paradeisos) -- "paradise" (NOT used in Luke 16, but relevant comparison)**
- Transliteration: paradeisos
- Pronunciation: par-ad
- Part of speech: masculine noun
- BLB Count: 3
- Strong's definition: of Oriental origin; a park, i.e. (specially), an Eden
- KJV translations: "paradise" (3x)
- NT occurrences: Luke 23:43; 2 Cor 12:2-4; Rev 2:7
- NOTE: Luke 16 does NOT use paradeisos for the righteous dead's location. It uses "Abraham's bosom" (kolpos Abraam) -- a phrase found nowhere else in Scripture. If Luke were teaching literal afterlife geography, the absence of the standard term "paradise" is notable.

**G3850 (parabole) -- "parable"**
- Transliteration: parabole
- Pronunciation: par-ab-ol-ay
- Part of speech: feminine noun
- BLB Count: 50
- Strong's definition: a similitude ("parable"), i.e. (symbolic) fictitious
- KJV translations: "parable" (21x), "parables" (15x), "a parable" (10x), "a figure" (2x), "comparison" (1x), "proverb" (1x)
- KEY LUKAN USES: Luke 5:36; 6:39; 8:4; 12:16; 12:41; 13:6; 14:7; 15:3; 18:1; 18:9; 19:11; 20:9; 20:19; 21:29
- NOTE: Luke 12:16 uses "a parable" (parabole) to introduce "a certain rich man" (anthropos tis plousios) -- the SAME opening formula as Luke 16:19. Luke 15:3 introduces a parabole that covers three consecutive stories (lost sheep, lost coin, prodigal son, 15:3-32). The word parabole does NOT appear in Luke 16:19, but Luke's established pattern shows he does not re-label each unit in a parabolic discourse.

### Phase 3: The Primary Passage -- Luke 16:19-31 in Literary Context

#### The Five Parables of Luke 15-16

Luke 15-16 contains a sequence of parables addressed to different audiences within the same discourse. The literary structure is:

1. **Parable of the Lost Sheep** (Luke 15:3-7) -- labeled parabole in 15:3
2. **Parable of the Lost Coin** (Luke 15:8-10) -- no separate label; covered by 15:3
3. **Parable of the Prodigal Son** (Luke 15:11-32) -- no separate label; covered by 15:3
4. **Parable of the Unjust Steward** (Luke 16:1-13) -- no separate label; introduced with "He said also unto his disciples"
5. **Rich Man and Lazarus** (Luke 16:19-31) -- no separate label; continues the discourse

**Key structural observations:**
- Luke 15:3 provides a single parabole label for three consecutive stories
- Luke 16:1 marks a shift in audience (from Pharisees to disciples), then 16:14-15 records Pharisees reacting, and 16:19 begins the fifth story in the series
- The "certain rich man" formula connects Luke 16:19 to Luke 12:16 (where it IS labeled parabole) and to Luke 16:1 (the unjust steward, also "a certain rich man")

#### Verses to Retrieve

2 Cor 12:2, 12:3, 12:4 (paradise -- living person's vision)

### Phase 4: Key Analytical Questions

1. **Genre Determination: Is Luke 16:19-31 a parable?**
   - Does the absence of the word parabole (G3850) prove the passage is non-parabolic?
   - What is Luke's parabole-labeling pattern? (Luke 15:3 covers three consecutive stories; Luke 12:16 uses the same opening formula WITH a parabole label)
   - Does the "certain rich man" (anthropos tis plousios) formula function as a Lukan parabolic marker? (Compare Luke 12:16, 16:1, 16:19)
   - What is the narrative setting? (Luke 15-16 is a continuous discourse)

2. **The Naming of Lazarus**
   - Lazarus is the only named human character in any parable of Jesus. Does this make the passage non-parabolic?
   - What does the name mean? (Lazaros = Greek form of Hebrew Eleazar = "God helps")
   - Is the name thematic (fitting the reversal-of-fortunes plot) rather than historical?
   - The rich man is UNNAMED in the Greek text ("Dives" comes from the Latin Vulgate, not from the Greek). Is an unnamed protagonist consistent with a historical account?

3. **The Stated Purpose of the Passage**
   - What does the passage itself identify as its teaching point?
   - Luke 16:29: "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."
   - Luke 16:31: "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
   - Is the passage teaching about afterlife geography, or about the sufficiency of existing revelation (Moses and the prophets)?

4. **Abraham's Bosom (kolpos Abraam)**
   - Does "Abraham's bosom" appear anywhere else in Scripture as a location for the dead? (No)
   - Does Luke use paradeisos (paradise) for this location? (No)
   - What is the origin of the "Abraham's bosom" concept? (Examine whether it reflects first-century Jewish intertestamental imagery rather than OT teaching)
   - John 1:18 uses kolpos for the Son being "in the bosom of the Father" -- intimate relationship, not geography

5. **Tree 3 Application (E-Item Positional Classification)**
   - Gate 1 (Subject): Is the rich man a literal human or a parabolic character?
   - Gate 2 (Grammar): Any grammatical issues?
   - Gate 3 (Genre): Is the passage didactic prose or parabolic narrative?
   - Gate 4 (Harmony): Does a literal reading conflict with other E-items? (Compare with Ecc 9:5,10; Ps 6:5; 115:17; Acts 2:29,34; etc.)
   - Follow the full Tree 3 reclassification procedure if any gate fails

6. **The Torment Vocabulary**
   - Luke 16 uses basanos (G931, noun: "torments") and odunao (G3600, verb: "to grieve/sorrow")
   - It does NOT use basanizo (G928, the standard "torment" verb in Rev 14:10; 20:10)
   - What does this vocabulary choice signify? Is odunao ("grieve/sorrow") weaker than basanizo ("torture")?
   - Compare: odunao is used in Luke 2:48 (Mary "sorrowing" for the child Jesus) and Acts 20:38 (disciples "sorrowing" at Paul's departure) -- neither involves eschatological torment

7. **The SIS Test: Clear Interprets Unclear**
   - How does this passage compare in clarity to the didactic death-state passages?
   - Clarity hierarchy: Didactic > Apocalyptic > Parabolic
   - If Luke 16:19-31 is parabolic, it is the LEAST clear genre for establishing doctrine
   - The didactic passages (Ecc 9:5,10; Ps 6:5; 115:17; 146:4; Job 14:12,21; etc.) directly address the state of the dead
   - Same-author evidence: Luke also wrote Acts, where Peter states David "is not ascended into the heavens" (Acts 2:34)

8. **Physical Impossibilities in the Narrative**
   - Can a disembodied soul have a tongue that needs cooling with water? (v.24)
   - Can a drop of water on a fingertip provide relief from flames? (v.24)
   - Can people in "torments" carry on extended conversations across a chasm? (vv.24-31)
   - Can people see across an impassable gulf to recognize specific individuals? (v.23)
   - Are these details consistent with literal afterlife description or with parabolic storytelling?

### Phase 5: Nave's Topical References

**PARABLES:**
- Of the trees: Jdg 9:8-15
- Of the lamb: 2 Sam 12:1-6
- Of the vineyard: Isa 5:1-7; 27:2,3
- Of the two eagles: Ezek 17
- Of Aholah and Aholibah: Ezek 23
- The boiling pot: Ezek 24:3-5
- See JESUS, PARABLES OF

**LAZARUS (Nave's entry):**
1. Brother of Mary and Martha. Sickness and death of (Jhn 11:1-14). Resurrection of (Jhn 11:38-44; 12:17,18). Had dinner with Jesus (Jhn 12:1,2,9). Plotted against by the chief priests (Jhn 12:10,11).
- NOTE: Nave's lists only ONE Lazarus -- the brother of Mary and Martha. The "Lazarus" of Luke 16 is NOT listed as a separate historical person. This is consistent with the parabolic reading.

**HADES (Nave's entry):**
1. The unseen world, translated "hell" in AV, but in RV the word "Hades" is retained: Mat 10:28; 11:23; 16:18; Luk 10:15; 16:23; Act 2:27,31; Rev 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14. See HELL.
2. The realm (state) of the dead: 2 Sam 22:6; Job 26:5; Ps 6:5; 17:15; 30:9; 49:15; 86:13; 88:10-12; 115:17; 116:3; Pro 15:24; 21:16; 27:20; Ecc 9:4-6; Isa 5:14; Jon 2:2; Luk 23:42,43; Jhn 8:22; 2 Cor 12:4.

**RICH, THE (Nave's entry):**
General scriptures: Neh 5:1-13; Job 21:7-15; 27:13-23; 31:24,25,28; Ps 49:16,17; 52:1-7; 73:3-22; Pro 14:20; 18:11,23; 28:11; Ecc 5:13,14,19,20; Jer 5:7-9,27-29; 9:23; 17:11; 22:13-19; Ezek 7:19; 28:5; Amo 6:1-6; Mic 6:12; Zep 1:18; **Mat 19:23,24; Mk 10:17-27; Luk 6:24,25; 12:15-21; 16:13,14,19-26; 18:22-26**; 1 Tim 6:17-19; Jas 1:9-11; 5:1-3.
- NOTE: Luke 16:19-26 is listed under "THE RICH" as a general scripture about the dangers of wealth, consistent with the parabolic reading where the rich man represents the failure to heed Moses and the prophets.

**ABRAHAM (Nave's entry -- relevant excerpts):**
- Son of Terah (Gen 11:26,27). Called "friend of God" (2 Chr 20:7; Jas 2:23). Faith of (Gen 15:6; Rom 4:1-22; Gal 3:6-9; Heb 11:8-10,17; Jas 2:21-24). Father of the faithful (Rom 4:16-18). In the genealogy of Jesus (Mat 1:1-2).
- NOTE: "Abraham's bosom" as a post-mortem destination is NOT a topic in Nave's Abraham entry. The concept is unique to Luke 16:22-23.

### Phase 6: Semantic Search Results

**Nave's Semantic Search: "rich man lazarus parable hades abraham"**
Top results: HADES (0.59), LAZARUS (0.57), ABRAHAM (0.54), RESURRECTION (0.42), KINGDOM OF HEAVEN (0.38). The search confirms the primary topical connections. The LAZARUS entry lists only the brother of Mary and Martha -- not a separate historical "Lazarus" from Luke 16.

**Semantic Studies Search: "rich man lazarus parable luke 16"**
Top matches: etc-09-rich-man-lazarus (0.797), etc3-09-rich-man-lazarus (0.795), etc2-09-rich-man-lazarus (0.794), etc4-09-rich-man-lazarus (0.762), etc5-09-rich-man-lazarus (0.651). Five prior iterations of this study exist, all converging on the parabolic reading.

**Semantic Strong's Search: "parable hades torment bosom"**
Top results: G929 basanismos (0.533), G928 basanizo (0.508), G5020 tartaroo (0.506), G3600 odunao (0.500), G931 basanos (0.484), G930 basanistes (0.465), G86 hades (0.453), G2851 kolasis (0.441), G2859 kolpos (0.425).

### Phase 7: LXX and Vocabulary Analysis

**The Torment Word Families in Luke 16 vs. Revelation:**

| Word | Strongs | Meaning | Luke 16 | Rev 14:10 | Rev 20:10 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| basanizo (verb) | G928 | to torture/torment | NOT USED | YES | YES |
| basanismos (noun) | G929 | torture/torment | NOT USED | YES | NOT USED |
| basanistes (noun) | G930 | torturer/tormentor | NOT USED | NOT USED | NOT USED |
| basanos (noun) | G931 | touchstone; torments | YES (16:23,28) | NOT USED | NOT USED |
| odunao (verb) | G3600 | to grieve/sorrow | YES (16:24,25) | NOT USED | NOT USED |

Key observation: Luke 16 and Revelation's eschatological torment passages use DIFFERENT vocabulary. Luke 16 uses basanos (touchstone/torments -- the noun root) and odunao (grieve/sorrow). Revelation 14:10 and 20:10 use basanizo (the verb form = to torture). If Luke intended to describe the same phenomenon as eschatological torment, the vocabulary divergence is notable.

**odunao (G3600) usage in Luke-Acts:**
- Luke 2:48: Mary says "thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing (odunomenoi)" -- about losing the child Jesus in the temple. This is grief/anxiety, not eschatological punishment.
- Luke 16:24: "I am tormented (odunaomai) in this flame"
- Luke 16:25: "thou art tormented (odunasai)"
- Acts 20:38: "Sorrowing (odunomenoi) most of all... that they should see his face no more" -- grief at parting. Not eschatological punishment.

The non-Luke 16 uses of odunao describe grief/sorrow/anxiety in ordinary human contexts (a mother's worry, friends' grief at parting). This suggests odunao is a grief/distress word, not an eschatological torment word.

### Phase 8: First-Century Jewish Context

The Research Agent should investigate the following contextual elements:

1. **Intertestamental Parallels:** The imagery of Luke 16:19-31 (compartmentalized afterlife, conversations between the blessed and the damned, an impassable gulf) closely parallels imagery found in intertestamental Jewish literature (1 Enoch, 4 Maccabees, and rabbinic tales). This imagery does NOT appear in the OT. The question is whether Jesus is endorsing this imagery as literal theology or using it as a familiar cultural backdrop for his parable -- just as the Prodigal Son uses familiar cultural elements (pig farming, distant country) without endorsing pig farming.

2. **The Pharisees as Audience:** Luke 16:14-15 specifically identifies the Pharisees as covetous ("lovers of money") and records their reaction to Jesus' teaching about money (the unjust steward parable). The Rich Man and Lazarus follows immediately and is directed at this same audience. The passage addresses the Pharisees' love of money and their failure to heed Moses and the prophets.

3. **Moses and the Prophets:** The climactic line (v.29,31) -- "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them" and "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead" -- is the passage's self-identified teaching point. This is about the authority and sufficiency of Scripture, not about afterlife geography.

### Phase 9: Analysis Framework

Structure your analysis around these questions:

1. **Genre Analysis:** Document all evidence for and against parabolic genre. Apply the Lukan parabole-labeling pattern. Apply Tree 3 (Genre Gate). Note the literary structure of Luke 15-16 as a continuous parabolic discourse.

2. **The Teaching Point:** What does the passage itself say it is teaching? Follow the text's own stated purpose (vv.29-31).

3. **Vocabulary Analysis:** Document the specific Greek words used for "torments" and "tormented" in Luke 16. Compare with the torment vocabulary used in Revelation. Note the absence of basanizo (G928) and the presence of odunao (G3600, "grieve/sorrow").

4. **The "Abraham's Bosom" Concept:** Document that kolpos Abraam as a post-mortem location appears ONLY in Luke 16:22-23. It is not found in the OT, not found in the Epistles, and not found in Revelation. If this were literal afterlife geography, the absence of corroborating Scripture is significant.

5. **Physical/Logical Details:** Document the physical impossibilities (tongue, water drop, conversation across gulf, visual recognition). Assess whether these are consistent with literal description or with parabolic storytelling.

6. **Harmony Test:** Compare the passage's depiction with the didactic death-state passages (Ecc 9:5,10; Ps 6:5; 115:17; 146:4; Job 14:12,21; etc.). Apply the clarity hierarchy: didactic > parabolic.

7. **Same-Author Evidence:** Luke wrote both Luke 16:19-31 and Acts 2:29,34 (David dead, not ascended to heaven). Does the same author's didactic teaching in Acts inform the reading of his parabolic narrative in Luke 16?

### Phase 10: Evidence Classification Requirements

For your CONCLUSION.md, classify evidence into:

**Explicit Statements (E):**
- What the text of Luke 16:19-31 directly says (verse by verse)
- The opening formula ("there was a certain rich man") and its Lukan parallels
- The Lukan parabole-labeling pattern (Luke 15:3 covers three stories; Luke 12:16 uses same formula with label)
- The passage's stated teaching point (vv.29,31)
- The vocabulary used (basanos, odunao -- NOT basanizo)
- The unique use of "Abraham's bosom" (nowhere else in Scripture as a post-mortem location)
- The naming of Lazarus (only named character in Jesus' parables)
- The rich man being unnamed in the Greek

**Necessary Implications (N):**
- If Luke 15:3's parabole label covers three consecutive stories without re-labeling each, the absence of a label in 16:19 is uninformative
- If Luke 12:16 uses the same formula with a parabole label, 16:19 is a known Lukan parabolic formula
- If the passage states its own teaching point (vv.29,31), the teaching point is about Moses and the prophets, not afterlife geography

**Inferences (I):**
- I-B: Is this a parable or a literal account? (Both sides cite evidence from the text)
- I-C: The literal afterlife geography reading (requires external framework: treating parabolic imagery as doctrinal)
- I-C: First-century Jewish imagery as background for the parable (external historical context)

### Phase 11: Cross-Study Integration

Connect findings to prior studies:
- **etc-04:** E155 (Luke 16:19-31 classified Neutral); I025 (literal afterlife geography classified I-C ECT-direction); I030 ("under the sun" invalidation -- classified I-C ECT-direction)
- **etc-05:** I032 (sheol/hades as conscious compartmentalized realm -- I-B, resolved Strong toward Conditionalist); N004 (death-state characterized by unconsciousness in didactic passages)
- **etc-01:** E011 (Ps 146:4 -- thoughts perish), E019 (Ecc 9:5 -- dead know nothing), E021 (Ecc 9:10 -- no work/knowledge in sheol)
- **etc-03:** E123 (Rev 20:14 -- second death = lake of fire); N016 (second death = lake of fire)
- **etc-05:** E155 (parable), E203 (hades and lake of fire are distinct), N022 (gehenna and sheol/hades distinct), N023 (hades distinct from lake of fire)

### Phase 12: Required Output Files

Write these files to D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-09-rich-man-lazarus/:

1. **01-topics.md** -- Outline of all analytical topics (genre analysis, vocabulary study, literary structure, teaching point, harmony test)
2. **02-verses.md** -- All verses retrieved from kjv.txt organized by category
3. **03-analysis.md** -- Verse-by-verse analysis of Luke 16:19-31, plus genre analysis, vocabulary analysis, literary context analysis, harmony analysis, and SIS application
4. **04-word-studies.md** -- Full word studies for G86, G931, G3600, G928, G2859, G3857, G3850 with usage comparisons
5. **CONCLUSION.md** -- Full evidence classification per etc-series-methodology.md, including:
   - Evidence tables (E, N, I with all four I-subtypes)
   - Tree 3 applications for all positional E-items
   - I-B Resolution subsections for all I-B inferences
   - Verification Phase
   - Master Evidence Update section
   - Positional Tally (this study)
   - Change Log
   - What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said
   - Analysis section
   - Conclusion

6. **Update etc-master-evidence.md** with all new items from this study

### Critical Reminders
- Verses MUST come from kjv.txt tool output, not from memory
- Follow etc-series-methodology.md exactly
- Apply Tree 3 to every positional E-item
- Apply SIS protocol to every I-B inference
- Update etc-master-evidence.md before writing your tally
- Prior studies have produced 431 items total (E001-E318, N001-N040, I001-I045)
- Next available IDs: E319, N041, I046
- Do NOT reference etc-01-what-is-man (deleted)
- Use investigative, not advocacy language
- The main E-item for this passage (E155) was already registered in etc-04 as Neutral; this study may add new E-items for specific observations but should reference E155 for the passage as a whole
- The key I-item (I025: Luke 16 teaches literal afterlife geography) was already registered in etc-04 as I-C ECT-direction
- The I-B resolution of sheol/hades as conscious compartmentalized realm (I032) was already resolved Strong in etc-05
- This study should provide the detailed evidence that etc-04 and etc-05 cross-referenced
- The Lukan parabole-labeling pattern (Luke 15:3 covering three stories; Luke 12:16 using same formula with label) is a KEY piece of internal Lukan evidence
- The vocabulary analysis (odunao vs. basanizo) is a NEW contribution from this study
- The "Abraham's bosom" uniqueness is a KEY observation -- this term as a post-mortem location appears only in Luke 16
- The passage's own stated teaching point (vv.29,31) should be given primary weight in determining the passage's purpose
