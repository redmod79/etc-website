# Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) — Plain-Language Summary

## What This Study Examined

Is the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-31 a parable, or is it a literal account of real events in the afterlife? That genre question matters enormously, because if it is a parable, its vivid afterlife imagery is a narrative vehicle for the story's actual lesson — not a map of the afterlife. If it is a literal account, then details like the flames, the gulf, and Abraham's bosom describe real post-mortem conditions.

This study gathered the evidence from across Scripture and weighed it carefully.

## What the Bible Says

### 1. The Story Sits Inside a Block of Five Parables

Luke 15-16 is a continuous parabolic discourse. Jesus tells five stories in a row: the lost sheep, the lost coin, the prodigal son, the unjust steward, and the rich man and Lazarus. Luke 15:3 introduces the whole block with a single parable label — "He spake this parable unto them" — and does not re-label each individual story. The absence of the word "parable" at Luke 16:19 does not mean the story is not a parable. That is simply how Luke writes parabolic discourses.

### 2. Luke Uses the Same Opening Formula for Parables

Luke uses the phrase "a certain rich man" (in Greek: *anthropos tis plousios*) three times:

- **Luke 12:16** — "He spake a parable unto them, saying, *The ground of a certain rich man...*" — explicitly labeled a parable.
- **Luke 16:1** — "*There was a certain rich man*..." — no parable label, but universally recognized as a parable.
- **Luke 16:19** — "*There was a certain rich man*..." — no parable label, disputed.

The same formula is labeled a parable in chapter 12 and recognized as a parable in 16:1. The same formula in 16:19 carries the same signal.

### 3. The Story's Own Stated Purpose Is About Moses and the Prophets

The passage tells us what it is teaching. The climax of the story is not a lesson about the geography of the afterlife. It is this exchange:

> "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them." — **Luke 16:29**

> "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead." — **Luke 16:31**

The story is about whether people will heed the existing Scripture. The afterlife imagery provides the dramatic setting; the statement about Moses and the prophets is the point.

### 4. "Abraham's Bosom" Appears Nowhere Else in Scripture

"Abraham's bosom" (*kolpos Abraam*) as a destination for the dead appears only in Luke 16:22-23. It is not in the Old Testament, the other Gospels, Acts, the Epistles, or Revelation. The standard New Testament term for the blessed resting place of the dead is *paradise* (*paradeisos*) — a word the same author, Luke, uses in Luke 23:43, but does not use here.

Elsewhere in the New Testament, *kolpos* (bosom) means an intimate relationship (John 1:18: "the bosom of the Father"), physical closeness (John 13:23: leaning on Jesus at the table), a garment fold used to carry things (Luke 6:38), or a geographic bay (Acts 27:39). None of these uses describe a post-mortem location.

### 5. The Torment Language Is Different From the Eschatological Torment Passages

Luke 16 uses the Greek words *basanos* (noun, "torments") and *odunao* (verb, "to grieve/sorrow") for its torment descriptions. The New Testament's clear eschatological torment passages — the ones describing the final punishment of the wicked — use a different word: *basanizo* (Revelation 14:10; 20:10).

The word translated "tormented" in Luke 16:24-25 (*odunao*) is the same word Luke uses in these two other places:

- **Luke 2:48** — Mary was "sorrowing" when she could not find the child Jesus in Jerusalem.
- **Acts 20:38** — The Ephesian elders were "sorrowing" at Paul's departure.

The word means grief or sorrow. Luke chose a grief word, not the standard torment word, for Luke 16.

### 6. The Rich Man Is Unnamed; the Name "Lazarus" Is Thematic

In the Greek text, the rich man has no name. The name "Dives" comes from the Latin Vulgate's word for "rich man" (*dives*) — it is not a proper name in the original. A literal historical account that identifies one person by name while leaving the other anonymous is unusual.

The name Lazarus is the Greek form of *Eleazar*, which means "God helps." That meaning fits the story's reversal-of-fortunes theme precisely: the man whom God helps ends up honored, while the self-sufficient rich man ends up in torment. The name is thematic — a storytelling choice, not a historical identifier. Nave's Topical Bible, a standard reference work, lists only one Lazarus as a biblical person: the brother of Mary and Martha in John 11-12. It does not list the Lazarus of Luke 16 as a separate historical individual.

### 7. The Same Author Records Didactic Teaching That Points the Other Way

Luke wrote both the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts. In Acts, Luke records Peter's direct teaching about the state of the dead:

> "David, that he is both dead and buried... David is not ascended into the heavens." — **Acts 2:29,34**

This is plain prose about a specific named person — David, a righteous man — and it says he is dead, buried, and has not gone to heaven. If Luke 16:19-31 were meant to teach that the righteous dead go immediately into conscious bliss in Abraham's bosom, it would sit uncomfortably alongside Luke's own recording of the opposite about David.

### 8. The Broader Testimony of Scripture on the State of the Dead

Multiple authors across multiple books of Scripture describe the dead as unconscious and unaware:

> "The dead know not any thing." — **Ecclesiastes 9:5**

> "In that very day his thoughts perish." — **Psalm 146:4**

> "In death there is no remembrance of thee; in the grave who shall give thee thanks?" — **Psalm 6:5**

> "Man lieth down and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep." — **Job 14:12**

> "The grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee." — **Isaiah 38:18-19**

These are direct, didactic statements — they are not parables or poetry about something else. In weighing Scripture against Scripture, plain teaching passages carry more weight than imagery drawn from a parable.

## What This Means

### The Parable Reading Is Well-Supported

Multiple independent lines of evidence converge toward reading Luke 16:19-31 as a parable:

- The Lukan "certain rich man" formula is a parabolic marker (Luke 12:16; 16:1; 16:19).
- Luke's labeling practice covers multiple stories with a single parable label (Luke 15:3).
- The story is the fifth in a continuous parabolic discourse spanning Luke 15-16.
- The story's own climax (vv.29,31) identifies its purpose: hearing Moses and the prophets.
- "Abraham's bosom" as a location appears only here and is not found anywhere else in Scripture.
- The torment vocabulary (*odunao*, "to grieve/sorrow") differs from the eschatological torment vocabulary (*basanizo*) used elsewhere in the New Testament.
- The same author (Luke) records in Acts that a righteous man (David) has not ascended to heaven.
- Nine direct passages from six or more biblical authors describe the dead as unconscious.

### The Literal Reading Rests on Weaker Ground

The main argument for reading the passage as a literal historical account is that Lazarus is the only named human character in any of Jesus' parables. That is a genuine observation — it is unusual. But the name is thematic, the rich man is unnamed (inconsistent with a literal two-person account), Old Testament parables also use symbolic names (Ezekiel 23: Aholah and Aholibah), and Nave's does not treat this Lazarus as a historical person.

One unusual element does not override a convergence of eight independent lines of evidence pointing the other direction.

Additionally, if the passage is read literally, several details create difficulties: a disembodied soul would not have a physical tongue or fingers; a drop of water on a fingertip cannot relieve fire; the detailed conversation across an impassable gulf with visual recognition of specific individuals functions as narrative mechanics, not a description of physical conditions. The rich man's memory and knowledge of his living brothers (Luke 16:25,28) would also contradict Ecclesiastes 9:5 ("the dead know not any thing") and Psalm 146:4 ("his thoughts perish") — if taken as a literal account of actual post-mortem experience.

### What the Story Is Actually About

The passage is addressed to the Pharisees, who are described immediately before it as "covetous" and who "derided" Jesus (Luke 16:14). The story's parabolic point is a rebuke: they had Moses and the prophets but would not hear them. The afterlife imagery — the reversal of the rich man's fortunes, the torment, the unbridgeable gulf — drives the lesson home. The dramatic setting is not the lesson itself.

The foreshadowing in verse 31 is striking: Jesus says that if people will not hear Moses and the prophets, they will not believe even if someone rises from the dead. Jesus himself would rise from the dead. A man named Lazarus did rise from the dead (John 11:43-44) — and the response was a plot to kill both Jesus and Lazarus (John 11:53; 12:10-11). The parable's ironic point proved accurate.

## Conclusion

Luke 16:19-31 is best understood as a parable — the fifth in a continuous parabolic discourse in Luke 15-16. Its teaching point, stated in the passage itself, is the authority and sufficiency of Moses and the prophets (vv.29,31). Its afterlife imagery provides the narrative vehicle for that lesson.

The passage cannot bear the weight of being used as a literal description of afterlife geography:

- "Abraham's bosom" as a post-mortem location is unique to this story and uncorroborated anywhere else in Scripture.
- The torment language differs from the New Testament's eschatological torment passages.
- The same author's didactic writing in Acts describes a righteous man as dead, buried, and not ascended to heaven.
- Nine direct passages from multiple biblical authors describe the dead as unconscious and unaware.

Arguments that the passage teaches the eternal torment view — that it maps literal afterlife geography, that the naming of Lazarus proves it is historical, or that the physical details describe actual post-mortem conditions — each require reading the passage in a way that the text itself does not support and that conflicts with how Luke writes and with the broader biblical witness on the state of the dead.

The parabolic reading is consistent with the text's own statement of purpose, with Luke's literary practice, with the vocabulary he chose, with his didactic material in Acts, and with the direct teaching of Scripture on the death-state.
