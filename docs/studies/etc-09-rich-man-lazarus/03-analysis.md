# Verse Analysis: Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31)

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Luke 16:19
> "There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:"

**Context:** This verse opens the fifth and final story in the Luke 15-16 parabolic discourse. The audience includes the Pharisees, identified in Luke 16:14 as "covetous" and as having "derided" Jesus.

**Direct statement:** A rich man lived extravagantly.

**Key observations:**
1. The opening formula "there was a certain rich man" (anthropos tis plousios) is identical to the formula used in Luke 12:16 (explicitly labeled parabole) and Luke 16:1 (universally recognized as a parable without a label).
2. The rich man is unnamed in the Greek text. "Dives" comes from the Latin Vulgate translation, not from the original. An unnamed protagonist is standard for parables (the prodigal son, the good Samaritan, the unjust steward).
3. Purple and fine linen signify extreme wealth. The characterization is archetypal, not biographical.

**Cross-references:** Luke 12:16 uses the same formula with an explicit parabole label, establishing "a certain rich man" as a Lukan parabolic marker.

### Luke 16:20-21
> "And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."

**Context:** The beggar is introduced as a contrast to the rich man.

**Direct statement:** A beggar named Lazarus lay at the rich man's gate, diseased and hungry, with dogs licking his sores.

**Key observations:**
1. Lazarus is the only named human character in any parable of Jesus. This is the primary argument for a non-parabolic reading.
2. The name Lazaros is the Greek form of Hebrew Eleazar, meaning "God helps." The name is thematic -- the character whom "God helps" is the one who appears helpless. The name functions as a parabolic element conveying meaning within the narrative.
3. The rich man remains unnamed. If this were a historical account of two specific individuals, the anonymity of one protagonist is unusual.
4. The details (gate, sores, dogs, crumbs) are standard storytelling elements establishing the reversal-of-fortunes theme.

**Cross-references:** Nave's Topical Bible lists only one Lazarus -- the brother of Mary and Martha (John 11). It does not list the Lazarus of Luke 16 as a separate historical person. This suggests the reference tradition did not treat Luke 16's Lazarus as historical.

---

### Luke 16:22
> "And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"

**Context:** The narrative transitions from earthly life to the afterlife scene.

**Direct statement:** The beggar died and was carried to Abraham's bosom. The rich man died and was buried.

**Key observations:**
1. "Abraham's bosom" (kolpos Abraam) as a post-mortem location appears only here in all of Scripture. kolpos (G2859) occurs 6 times in the NT: Luke 6:38 (fold of garment), Luke 16:22-23 (here), John 1:18 (Son in the bosom of the Father -- intimate relationship), John 13:23 (disciple leaning on Jesus' bosom -- physical proximity at a meal), Acts 27:39 (a bay/inlet). None of the other uses designate a post-mortem location.
2. The passage does not use paradeisos (G3857, "paradise"), the standard NT term for the abode of the blessed (Luke 23:43; 2 Cor 12:4; Rev 2:7). The same author (Luke) uses paradeisos in Luke 23:43. If this passage were teaching literal afterlife geography, the use of a unique, non-standard term instead of the established term is notable.
3. No other biblical author references "Abraham's bosom" as a location. The concept lacks corroboration across the canon.

**Cross-references:** John 1:18 uses kolpos for the Son's intimate relationship with the Father, not as geography. The parallel suggests "Abraham's bosom" conveys closeness/fellowship rather than a literal place.

---

### Luke 16:23
> "And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."

**Context:** The rich man is now in hades (G86), described as "in torments" (en basanois, G931).

**Direct statement:** The rich man is in hades, in torments, and sees Abraham with Lazarus at a distance.

**Key observations:**
1. "Hell" translates hades (G86). This is the only occurrence in the NT where hades is depicted as a place of conscious torment -- and it occurs within a parable. All 10 other hades occurrences carry no torment association: Matt 11:23 (judgment on a city), Matt 16:18 (gates of hades vs. church), Luke 10:15 (judgment on a city), Acts 2:27,31 (Christ's soul not left in hades), 1 Cor 15:55 (hades has no victory), Rev 1:18 (Christ holds the keys), Rev 6:8 (personification following death), Rev 20:13-14 (delivers up dead, then cast into lake of fire).
2. "Torments" is basanos (G931), not basanizo (G928). basanos occurs only 3 times in the NT: Matt 4:24 (physical diseases), Luke 16:23, and Luke 16:28. The standard NT verb for eschatological torment is basanizo, which appears in Rev 14:10 and 20:10 but does not appear in Luke 16.
3. The ability to see across hades to Abraham's bosom, recognize specific individuals, and carry on conversation is a narrative device. These details serve the story's progression toward its teaching point (vv.29-31).

**Cross-references:** Same-author evidence: In Acts 2:27,31, Luke records that Christ's soul was in hades but was not left there -- resurrection is the deliverance from hades. In Acts 2:29,34, the same author records Peter stating David is dead, buried, and has not ascended to heaven. Luke does not present hades as a place of consciousness in his didactic writing.

### Luke 16:24
> "And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."

**Context:** The rich man addresses Abraham and requests relief.

**Direct statement:** The rich man asks Abraham to send Lazarus with a drop of water to cool his tongue, stating he is "tormented" (odunaomai, G3600) in flame.

**Key observations:**
1. "I am tormented" translates odunaomai (G3600), from odunao, meaning "to grieve, to sorrow." This is not basanizo (G928). odunao occurs 4 times in the NT: Luke 2:48 (Mary "sorrowing" for the child Jesus), Luke 16:24, Luke 16:25, Acts 20:38 (disciples "sorrowing" at Paul's departure). The KJV translates odunao as "sorrowing" in Luke 2:48 and Acts 20:38 but as "tormented" in Luke 16:24-25 -- same word, different English rendering.
2. A disembodied soul requesting physical water for a physical tongue represents either literal afterlife physicality (which contradicts the disembodied state) or parabolic narrative detail. The detail serves the story -- the rich man's request to send Lazarus (still treating him as a servant) reinforces the reversal theme.
3. A single drop of water on a fingertip providing relief from flames is narratively constructed for the parabolic point, not as a realistic description of the afterlife.

**Cross-references:** Same-author usage of odunao: In Luke 2:48, Mary is "sorrowing" (odunomenoi) -- a mother's grief and worry. In Acts 20:38, the disciples are "sorrowing" (odunomenoi) -- grief at parting. Neither context involves eschatological punishment. The word denotes grief/distress.

---

### Luke 16:25
> "But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."

**Context:** Abraham responds to the rich man.

**Direct statement:** Abraham explains the reversal: the rich man received good things in life and Lazarus received evil things; now the roles are reversed.

**Key observations:**
1. "Thou art tormented" again uses odunao (G3600), not basanizo.
2. The reversal-of-fortunes theme is the parabolic core: those who had comfort now lack it; those who suffered now have comfort. This is a standard parabolic pattern in Jesus' teaching (Matt 20:16, "the last shall be first"; Luke 6:24-25, "Woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation").
3. The explanation is moral (misuse of wealth, failure to help the poor) rather than eschatological (violation of specific doctrines about the afterlife).

---

### Luke 16:26
> "And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence."

**Context:** Abraham describes an impassable gulf separating the two groups.

**Direct statement:** A fixed gulf separates Abraham's bosom from the place of torment. Passage between them is impossible.

**Key observations:**
1. The "great gulf fixed" is a narrative element establishing the finality of the reversal. Its function within the story is to prevent any remedy for the rich man's situation, driving the narrative toward vv.27-31.
2. If taken as literal afterlife geography, this presents a two-compartment model of hades visible across a gulf, with conversations possible across the divide. No other biblical passage describes this geography.
3. The detail that people in torment can see and converse with people in comfort across a great gulf is a storytelling element. The rich man needs to be able to see Lazarus for the reversal to function, and he needs to be able to communicate with Abraham for the dialogue in vv.27-31 to occur.

---

### Luke 16:27-28
> "Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment."

**Context:** The rich man shifts his request from personal relief to his brothers.

**Direct statement:** The rich man asks Abraham to send Lazarus to warn his five brothers.

**Key observations:**
1. "This place of torment" uses basanos (G931) again -- the noun form, not the verb basanizo (G928).
2. The narrative has now moved from the reversal theme to its actual teaching point. The rich man's request to send a messenger sets up Abraham's response about Moses and the prophets.
3. The rich man still treats Lazarus as someone who should be "sent" on errands -- even in the afterlife he sees Lazarus as a servant. This detail serves the parabolic characterization of the rich man's attitude.

---

### Luke 16:29
> "Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."

**Context:** Abraham's first response to the request.

**Direct statement:** Abraham says the rich man's brothers have Moses and the prophets and should listen to them.

**Key observations:**
1. This is the passage's stated teaching point. Abraham's answer identifies what is sufficient for the rich man's brothers: Moses and the prophets (the existing Scriptures).
2. The passage's own climax is not about afterlife geography but about the sufficiency of Scripture. "Moses and the prophets" = the written revelation available to them.
3. This connects directly to the narrative context: the Pharisees in Luke 16:14-15, who were "covetous" and "derided" Jesus. They had Moses and the prophets but failed to heed them. The parable is addressed to them.
4. Connecting to Luke 16:16-17: "The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached." The transition between the old and new eras is the immediate literary context.

**Cross-references:** The passage's teaching point aligns with 2 Tim 3:15-16 (the Scriptures make one wise unto salvation) and John 5:39,46 (Moses wrote of Christ).

---

### Luke 16:30
> "And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent."

**Context:** The rich man disagrees with Abraham's assessment.

**Direct statement:** The rich man argues that a messenger from the dead would be more effective than Moses and the prophets.

**Key observations:**
1. The rich man's counter-proposal is that a supernatural sign (someone rising from the dead) would persuade his brothers to repent.
2. This sets up the passage's culminating statement in v.31, which is the ultimate point of the entire narrative.

---

### Luke 16:31
> "And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."

**Context:** Abraham's final response -- the passage's climactic statement.

**Direct statement:** If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, even a resurrection will not persuade them.

**Key observations:**
1. This is the capstone of the passage. The entire narrative -- the rich man, Lazarus, the reversal, the torment, the gulf, the request -- builds toward this statement.
2. The passage's purpose is about the authority and sufficiency of Scripture ("Moses and the prophets"), not about afterlife geography. Abraham's bosom, the flames, and the gulf are narrative elements in the service of this teaching point.
3. The ironic foreshadowing is significant: Jesus himself would rise from the dead, and many (including the Pharisees addressed in this context) would still not believe. A Lazarus did rise from the dead (John 11:43-44), and the response was a plot to kill both Jesus and Lazarus (John 11:53; 12:10-11).
4. The passage's stated purpose (vv.29,31) concerns revelation and response, not cosmology.

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: The Lukan Parabolic Formula
Luke uses "a certain rich man" (anthropos tis plousios) as a parabolic opening in three passages:
- **Luke 12:16** -- explicitly labeled parabole. The Rich Fool.
- **Luke 16:1** -- no parabole label. The Unjust Steward. Universally recognized as a parable.
- **Luke 16:19** -- no parabole label. The Rich Man and Lazarus. Disputed.

The pattern establishes that the absence of a parabole label does not determine whether a passage is parabolic. Luke 15:3 provides a single label for three consecutive stories (lost sheep, lost coin, prodigal son) without re-labeling each.

### Pattern 2: The Luke 15-16 Parabolic Discourse
Luke 15-16 contains five consecutive narratives in a single discourse:
1. Lost Sheep (15:4-7) -- labeled parabole in 15:3
2. Lost Coin (15:8-10) -- no separate label
3. Prodigal Son (15:11-32) -- no separate label
4. Unjust Steward (16:1-13) -- no separate label; audience shifts to disciples
5. Rich Man and Lazarus (16:19-31) -- no separate label; Pharisees rejoin as audience (16:14-15)

All five are told within the same narrative setting. The parabole label in 15:3 governs the literary context. The discourse does not shift to a new genre between stories 4 and 5.

### Pattern 3: Vocabulary Divergence from Eschatological Torment Passages
Luke 16 uses basanos (G931, noun: "torments/touchstone") and odunao (G3600, verb: "grieve/sorrow"). Revelation's eschatological torment passages use basanizo (G928, verb: "torture/torment"). The two vocabulary sets do not overlap:

| Feature | Luke 16 | Rev 14:10; 20:10 |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Torment noun | basanos (G931) | basanismos (G929) |
| Torment verb | odunao (G3600, "grieve") | basanizo (G928, "torture") |
| Subjects | A parabolic character | Devil, beast, false prophet |
| Setting | Hades (temporary) | Lake of fire (final) |
| Genre | Parabolic narrative | Apocalyptic vision |

If Luke intended to describe the same phenomenon as Rev 14:10 and 20:10, the vocabulary divergence requires explanation. Luke uses a word (odunao) that in his other uses means ordinary grief (Luke 2:48; Acts 20:38), not eschatological torture.

### Pattern 4: "Abraham's Bosom" as a Unique, Uncorroborated Concept
"Abraham's bosom" (kolpos Abraam) as a post-mortem location for the righteous dead appears only in Luke 16:22-23. It does not appear in:
- The Old Testament
- The other Gospels
- Acts (by the same author)
- The Epistles of Paul, Peter, John, James, or Jude
- Revelation

The standard NT term for the abode of the blessed is paradeisos (G3857), which the same author (Luke) uses in Luke 23:43. If "Abraham's bosom" were actual afterlife geography, the lack of corroboration anywhere else in Scripture is significant.

### Pattern 5: Same-Author Evidence (Luke-Acts)
Luke is the author of both Luke 16:19-31 and Acts. In Acts, Luke records:
- Acts 2:27,31 -- Christ's soul was in hades; he was not left there (resurrection as deliverance from hades)
- Acts 2:29 -- David is "both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day"
- Acts 2:34 -- "David is not ascended into the heavens"

The same author who writes the Rich Man and Lazarus also records Peter's apostolic sermon stating David (a righteous man) has not ascended to heaven but is dead and buried. Luke's didactic material in Acts presents death-state as unconsciousness and the hope as resurrection, not as conscious existence in a compartment of hades.

### Pattern 6: The Passage's Self-Identified Teaching Point
Luke 16:29 and 16:31 state the passage's own purpose:
- v.29: "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."
- v.31: "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."

The teaching concerns the sufficiency and authority of existing Scripture ("Moses and the prophets"). The afterlife imagery is the narrative vehicle, not the teaching content.

## Connections Between Passages

### Luke 16:19-31 and the Didactic Death-State Passages
The didactic death-state passages (8+ authors, 6+ books) consistently describe the dead as unconscious:
- Ecc 9:5: "The dead know not any thing"
- Ecc 9:10: "No work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave"
- Ps 6:5: "In death there is no remembrance of thee"
- Ps 115:17: "The dead praise not the LORD; neither any that go down into silence"
- Ps 146:4: "In that very day his thoughts perish"
- Job 14:21: "His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not"

Luke 16:19-31 depicts consciousness in hades. The clarity hierarchy (didactic > apocalyptic > parabolic) places didactic passages above parabolic narratives for establishing doctrine. If Luke 16 is parabolic, it occupies the lowest position in the clarity hierarchy and cannot override the plain didactic statements.

### Luke 16:19-31 and Isaiah 14:9-10
Isaiah 14 is explicitly labeled a mashal (taunt-poem) in v.4. In this mashal, the dead kings "speak" in sheol, sheol is "moved," and trees "rejoice." No interpreter takes these details as literal descriptions of sheol. The literary convention of giving voice to the dead in figurative/poetic contexts is established in the OT. Luke 16's depiction of conversation in hades follows the same literary convention.

### Luke 16:19-31 and Ezekiel 32:21,27
Ezekiel 32 is prophetic lamentation where dead warriors "speak" in sheol yet lie with swords under their heads (sleep imagery). The text depicts both speech and sleep simultaneously -- the speech is a literary device within a recognized poetic genre.

### Luke 16:19-31 and Genesis 4:10
Abel's blood "crieth" from the ground (Gen 4:10). Abel is not literally conscious and speaking. The personification of the dead/their blood "crying out" is a biblical literary convention that does not require literal consciousness.

## Word Study Insights

### basanos (G931) vs. basanizo (G928)
Luke 16 uses the noun basanos (G931, "touchstone/torments") but not the verb basanizo (G928, "to torture/torment"). basanos appears only 3 times in the NT: Matt 4:24 (physical diseases), Luke 16:23, Luke 16:28. basanizo appears 12 times, including the two eschatological torment passages (Rev 14:10; 20:10). The vocabulary of Luke 16 does not match the vocabulary of the eschatological torment passages.

### odunao (G3600) -- "to grieve/sorrow," not "to torture"
odunao appears 4 times. In its non-Luke 16 uses, it describes ordinary grief: Mary's anxiety over losing Jesus (Luke 2:48) and disciples' sorrow at Paul's departure (Acts 20:38). The KJV translates it "sorrowing" in these contexts but "tormented" in Luke 16:24-25. The word means grief/distress, not eschatological torment. It belongs to a different word family from basanizo.

### The Combined Vocabulary Picture
Luke 16 uses:
- basanos (G931) -- a noun meaning "touchstone" or "testing/torment" (from the testing of metals)
- odunao (G3600) -- a verb meaning "to grieve/sorrow"

It does NOT use:
- basanizo (G928) -- the standard verb for torment in eschatological passages
- basanismos (G929) -- the standard noun for torment in Rev 14:11
- kolasis (G2851) -- "punishment" (Matt 25:46)

This vocabulary divergence is consistent with a parabolic narrative using its own storytelling vocabulary rather than the technical vocabulary of eschatological judgment.

## Difficult Passages

### The Naming of Lazarus
The naming of a character in a parable is unusual and constitutes the most substantive argument for a non-parabolic reading. No other parable of Jesus names its human characters.

However, several observations qualify this argument:
1. The name Lazaros (= Eleazar, "God helps") is thematic. The character whom "God helps" is the one who appears helpless in life but is vindicated after death. The name carries meaning within the narrative, as parabolic names often do in OT parables (Aholah and Aholibah in Ezek 23 mean "her tent" and "my tent is in her" -- symbolic names conveying theological meaning).
2. The rich man is unnamed. If this were a historical account of two specific individuals, the anonymity of one protagonist is inconsistent with historical reporting.
3. The naming of Lazarus does not change the genre classification of the passage. All other indicators (the opening formula, the literary context, the narrative structure, the passage's stated teaching point) point to parabolic genre. A single atypical element (a named character) does not override multiple standard indicators.

### Consciousness in Hades
The depiction of consciousness in hades in Luke 16:23-25 is the central challenge for the parabolic reading. If the passage is parabolic, the consciousness is a narrative device within the story. If the passage is literal, it describes the actual state of the dead.

The resolution depends on genre determination. If the passage is parabolic (as the literary evidence indicates), then the consciousness serves the story's need for dialogue -- the teaching point of vv.29-31 requires the characters to communicate. If the passage is didactic, it contradicts the didactic death-state passages from 8+ other authors. The clarity hierarchy places didactic passages above parabolic narratives. The didactic passages govern the reading of the parabolic narrative, not the reverse.

### The Rich Man's Knowledge and Memory
In Luke 16:25,28, the rich man remembers his earthly life and knows about his brothers. This contradicts Ecc 9:5 ("the dead know not any thing"), Ps 146:4 ("in that very day his thoughts perish"), and Job 14:21 ("His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not"). These details function as narrative elements necessary for the story to progress toward its teaching point. The rich man must remember his life and know about his brothers for the request in vv.27-28 to make sense.
