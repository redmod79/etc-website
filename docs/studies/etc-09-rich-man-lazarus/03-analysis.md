## Overview

This study addresses the central question of the ETC5 series' ninth installment: Is Luke 16:19-31 a literal account of the intermediate state of the dead, or is it a parable employing familiar Jewish imagery to make a point about the sufficiency of Moses and the prophets? This determination is the crux of IB006, which has remained Unresolved across five prior studies (etc5-03 through etc5-08).

The analysis proceeds in ten sections:
1. Context and Genre Markers in Luke 15-16
2. The "Certain Rich Man" Formula
3. The Naming of Lazarus
4. Verse-by-Verse Analysis of Luke 16:19-31
5. Greek Word Studies (basanos, hades, chasma, kolpos)
6. Hades, N026, and the Limits of Literalism
7. Paradise (Luke 23:43) and Abraham's Bosom
8. Phil 1:23 and 2 Cor 5:8
9. The Theological Point: Moses and the Prophets (vv.29-31)

## Section 1: Context and Genre Markers in Luke 15-16

### The Parabolic Series Beginning at Luke 15:1-3

Luke 15 opens with a public occasion: "Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them" (15:1-2). Jesus responds with a parabolic discourse explicitly introduced in verse 3: "And he spake this parable unto them, saying..." (εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην λέγων).

The word parabolē (G3850) appears in v.3. Crucially, it appears once — introducing what follows. What follows is not one parable but three consecutive narratives:
- Lost sheep (15:4-7)
- Lost coin (15:8-10)
- Prodigal son (15:11-32)

The Prodigal Son (15:11-32) is universally identified as a parable. No interpreter disputes this. Yet it has NO parabolē label of its own. The single parabolē label at 15:3 covers the entire series of three connected narratives.

This is the established Lukan pattern: a single parabolē introduction covers a connected pericope, and subsequent units within the pericope are not individually re-labeled.

### The Transition to Luke 16

Luke 16 continues without a chapter break in meaning. Verses 16:1-13 present the Parable of the Dishonest Steward, opening with "There was a certain rich man" (Ἄνθρωπός τις ἦν πλούσιος, 16:1) — no parabolē label. This is addressed to the disciples (v.1). Verses 16:14-18 record the Pharisees' mocking reaction and three bridge sayings about the Law, the Kingdom, and divorce. Then 16:19 begins: "There was a certain rich man" (Ἄνθρωπος δέ τις ἦν πλούσιος) — again, no parabolē label.

The broader Luke 15-16 structure reads as follows:

| Passage | Content | Parabolē Label? |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| 15:3 | Introduction | **YES** — explicit |
| 15:4-7 | Lost Sheep | No (covered by 15:3) |
| 15:8-10 | Lost Coin | No (covered by 15:3) |
| 15:11-32 | Prodigal Son | No (covered by 15:3) |
| 16:1-13 | Dishonest Steward | No |
| 16:14-18 | Bridge Sayings | — |
| 16:19-31 | Rich Man and Lazarus | No |

The absence of a parabolē label in Luke 16:19-31 is not anomalous for this pericope-group. It is consistent with Luke's consistent practice of not relabeling every unit within a connected parabolic discourse.

### The Law/Prophets Frame

A key structural observation: the Rich Man/Lazarus narrative is bracketed by explicit references to the Law and the Prophets:
- Luke 16:16-18 (immediately before the narrative): "The law and the prophets were until John... It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
- Luke 16:29, 31 (the stated conclusion of the narrative): "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them... If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."

The narrative is nested inside a Law/Prophets frame. The story begins after Jesus discusses the sufficiency of the Law and ends with a statement about the sufficiency of Moses and the Prophets. This bracketing structure is a standard Lukan literary technique (inclusio) in which the framing material indicates the passage's interpretive key.

The interpretive key here is: the narrative exists to make a point about the adequacy of existing revelation (Moses and the Prophets), not to provide a description of the afterlife's geography.

---

## Section 2: The "Certain Rich Man" Formula

The opening formula of Luke 16:19 is: Ἄνθρωπος δέ τις ἦν πλούσιος ("There was a certain rich man"). Compare with:

- **Luke 12:16** — "The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully" — the opening of the Rich Fool narrative. This narrative is *explicitly* introduced by: "And he spake a parable (parabolēn, G3850) unto them, saying..." (12:16). The exact same "rich man" formula occurs in a *labeled* parable.

- **Luke 16:1** — "There was a certain rich man" (Ἄνθρωπός τις ἦν πλούσιος) — the Dishonest Steward. No parabolē label; universally classified as a parable by interpreters.

- **Luke 16:19** — "There was a certain rich man" (Ἄνθρωπος δέ τις ἦν πλούσιος) — Rich Man and Lazarus. No parabolē label.

The particle δέ (de) in 16:19 is a connective particle — it joins 16:19 to the preceding material. The opening is structurally the same as 16:1 (Dishonest Steward) and echoes 12:16 (Rich Fool, explicitly a parable).

The inescapable textual observation is this: the exact literary formula that begins Luke 16:19 is, in Luke 12:16, *explicitly* labeled a parable by Luke. Luke knows how to use the parabolē label. When he does not use it, it is not because the narrative is a different genre — the Dishonest Steward (16:1-13) and the Prodigal Son (15:11-32) show this. The formula "there was a certain rich man" is a Lukan parabolic idiom.

---

## Section 3: The Naming of Lazarus

The strongest argument for a literal reading of Luke 16:19-31 is the naming of the poor man: "There was a certain beggar named Lazarus." In no other parable of Jesus is a human character given a proper name. (Abraham and Moses appear in narrative contexts and parables, but they are historical figures being referenced, not fictional characters.) "Lazarus" is a Greek form of the Hebrew "Eleazar" (אֶלְעָזָר), meaning "God helps."

Three observations are necessary:

**First, the meaning of the name is parabolic.** "God helps" — the man whom God helps — is precisely the theological point being made. The poor beggar who is ignored by the rich man is the one God vindicates. The name is thematically appropriate to a parabolic reversal story in a way that argues for, not against, the parable reading.

**Second, the rich man is unnamed.** The practice of calling him "Dives" comes from the Latin Vulgate's rendering of the Greek πλούσιος (plousios = "rich") as the Latin adjective dives (rich) — a translation choice by Jerome, not a name in the Greek text. The rich man, the character whose experience is the central dramatic element of the narrative, has no name. If this were a literal historical account, the unnamed protagonist is anomalous.

**Third, the naming of Lazarus does not break the genre.** The Literary observation stands: this is the only named human in a parable of Jesus. This is an unusual feature that prevents the classification from reaching "Strong" certainty in either direction. But a single unusual feature in a parable does not convert the genre to history. Extraordinary detail does not convert genre to biography: the Prodigal Son contains detailed dialogue, emotional description, and sequential narrative events without becoming a historical account. The naming of Lazarus is the strongest argument for the ECT reading; it cannot be dismissed. But it is also insufficient by itself to override the convergent genre evidence from the parabolic opening formula, the Law/Prophets frame, the stated theological purpose, and the parabolic pericope context.

## Section 4: Verse-by-Verse Analysis of Luke 16:19-31

### v.19 — The Rich Man's Condition
"There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day."

Purple clothing was expensive — a marker of extreme wealth and self-indulgence. This is the opening portrait of excess. The character functions as a social type: the wealthy person so absorbed in luxury that he does not see the suffering at his gate. In the first-century context, this portrait would immediately evoke the covetous Pharisees of v.14.

### v.20-21 — The Beggar's Condition
"And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."

The contrast is stark: the rich man dines sumptuously; Lazarus receives the crumbs. The dogs licking his sores — in first-century Jewish culture, dogs were unclean animals — adds to his degradation. The reversal theme is being established. Lazarus is the lowest of the low in earthly social standing.

### v.22 — The Deaths
"And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried."

Greek verb tenses: ἀπέθανεν (aorist active indicative 3rd singular — died), ἀπενεχθῆναι (aorist passive infinitive — to be carried), καὶ ἐτάφη (aorist passive indicative — and was buried). Both deaths are simple aorist events — past, completed. The contrast continues: Lazarus is carried by angels to honor; the rich man is buried (the ordinary fate).

"Abraham's bosom" (κόλπον τοῦ Ἀβραάμ, G2859) — kolpos is used elsewhere for the place of honor at a feast (John 13:23 = John "in the bosom of Jesus" at the Last Supper; John 1:18 = the Son "in the bosom of the Father"). It is an idiom for the place of intimate fellowship and honor. In first-century Jewish thought, the righteous dead would one day recline at the messianic banquet with Abraham. "Abraham's bosom" pictures Lazarus in that place of intimate eschatological honor. The idiom does not require a literal description of the intermediate state's geography.

### v.23 — The Rich Man in Hades
"And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."

Greek: καὶ ἐν τῷ ᾅδῃ ἐπάρας τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, ὑπάρχων ἐν βασάνοις (hades, dative singular of G86; ὑπάρχων = present active participle of hyparchō = "being/existing"; βασάνοις = dative plural of G931 basanos = "torments/pains").

The word for torment here is basanos (G931), not basanismos (G929). This distinction matters: G929 basanismos is the torment vocabulary exclusive to Revelation's eschatological judgment passages (all 5 occurrences in Revelation — Rev 9:5; 14:11; 18:7; 18:10; 18:15). The word used in Luke 16 (G931 basanos) appears only 3 times in the NT: Matthew 4:24 (physical torment/disease), Luke 16:23, and Luke 16:28. It is not the standard word for eschatological conscious suffering.

The location is hades (G86), not gehenna. This is crucial: hades is the temporary pre-resurrection state (N026 established in etc5-04). Even on a literal reading, the rich man is in hades, which Rev 20:13-14 shows is a temporary holding state that is itself cast into the lake of fire at the final judgment. Luke 16 cannot, even on a literal reading, describe the *final* fate of the wicked — it describes a pre-resurrection state.

### v.24 — The Rich Man's Cry
"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."

Greek: ὀδυνῶμαι (odunaomai, G3600 = "I am tormented/in anguish" — the same word used in Luke 2:48 for Mary and Joseph's anguish when Jesus was lost). The flame (φλογί, phlogí) provides the sensory detail.

The physical impossibility here is parabolic: a disembodied soul having fingers to dip in water, a tongue to be cooled. The ECT response is that these are accommodations — figurative language for real experiences. The Conditionalist response is that this is exactly what parabolic imagery looks like: it uses physical detail to communicate spiritual reality without requiring literal physical bodies in the intermediate state.

### v.25 — Abraham's Answer
"But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."

This verse makes the theological structure of the narrative explicit. The reversal: good things in life → torment in death; evil things in life → comfort in death. This is the *exact reversal-of-fortunes* structure that appears throughout Luke's Gospel:
- Luke 1:52-53: "He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away."
- Luke 6:20-26: "Blessed be ye poor... Woe unto you that are rich..." (the Beatitudes and Woes — direct reversal parallels to Luke 16:25)
- Luke 14:11: "Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."

The reversal of fortunes is a defining characteristic of Lukan narrative theology. It appears in the Magnificat, in the Beatitudes, and in multiple Lukan parables. Its presence here is a genre signal, not incidental detail.

### v.26 — The Great Gulf
"And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence."

Greek: χάσμα μέγα ἐστήρικται (chasma mega estēríktai). Chasma (G5490) is a hapax legomenon — it appears only here in the entire NT. Estēríktai is a perfect passive indicative of stērizō (to set firmly, establish) — the completed state: it has been fixed and remains fixed. The permanence of the separation is linguistically emphasized.

The motif of a great gulf or barrier separating the righteous and wicked dead in the afterlife is well-attested in Jewish intertestamental literature: 1 Enoch 22 describes four chambers for the dead separated by a spring of water; the Testament of Abraham describes a barrier between the place of judgment and the place of reward; the Apocalypse of Zephaniah describes a similar geography. Jesus was drawing on familiar imagery from Jewish apocalyptic tradition — imagery both he and his audience (Pharisees, v.14) would recognize.

The use of known intertestamental imagery does not prove the passage is fictional. Jesus could use familiar imagery to describe real realities. But it does indicate that the specific details of the narrative (the gulf, the two regions, the visual communication) are drawn from a known Jewish literary tradition, not from unique divine revelation of unprecedented afterlife geography.

### vv.27-28 — The Request for the Living Brothers
"Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment."

The rich man's request to have Lazarus sent to his five living brothers shifts the focus of the narrative toward the living. The concern for the brothers who are still alive — who have access to Moses and the Prophets — is the narrative's hinge. The dramatic dialogue about afterlife geography is in service of a point about the present responsibilities of the living.

### vv.29-31 — The Stated Theological Purpose
"Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they would repent. And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."

This is the stated purpose and climax of the narrative. The theological point is not:
- "The afterlife really has two compartments with a gulf between them"
- "The wicked really do experience conscious torment in hades"
- "The righteous really are in Abraham's bosom"

The theological point is: "Moses and the Prophets are sufficient. If someone does not hear them, a resurrection from the dead will not convince them either."

Cross-testament parallel data confirms this: the top NT parallels for Luke 16:31 are all Moses-and-the-Prophets passages: Luke 16:29 (0.507), Acts 3:22 (0.458), Luke 20:37 (0.437), Luke 24:27 (0.391), Acts 28:23 (0.433). The passage's thematic connections are to the sufficiency of Scripture argument, not to afterlife geography passages.

The phrase "though one rose from the dead" (ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῇ — aorist active subjunctive of anistēmi, the resurrection vocabulary word) anticipates the resurrection of another Lazarus — Lazarus of Bethany (John 11) — and the Jewish leadership's response to it (John 11:47-53; 12:10). Even after a literal resurrection from the dead, the religious authorities did not repent; they conspired to kill both Jesus and the raised Lazarus. Jesus' parabolic statement at 16:31 was historically vindicated.

## Section 5: Greek Word Studies

### G931 basanos vs. G929 basanismos

The torment vocabulary of Luke 16 requires careful examination.

**Luke 16:23** — ὑπάρχων ἐν βασάνοις = "being in torments" (G931 basanos, dative plural)
**Luke 16:28** — τόπον τοῦτον τῆς βασάνου = "this place of torment" (G931 basanos, genitive singular)
**Luke 16:24** — ὀδυνῶμαι ἐν τῇ φλογὶ ταύτῃ = "I am tormented in this flame" (G3600 odunaomai — a different word)

G931 (basanos) occurs only 3 times in the entire NT: Matthew 4:24 and Luke 16:23, 28. In Matthew 4:24, it describes sick people who were brought to Jesus and healed — a completely medical, physical usage. This is not the standard word for eschatological torment.

G929 (basanismos) — the abstract torment noun — occurs 6 times in the NT. ALL 6 occurrences are in Revelation: Rev 9:5; 14:11; 18:7; 18:10; 18:15. These are uniformly in eschatological judgment contexts. The complete absence of G929 from Luke 16 is significant: if Luke 16 were intended to describe the eschatological torment of the wicked dead, the vocabulary that Revelation consistently uses for exactly that purpose is absent.

### G86 haidēs

Hades (G86) occurs 11 times in the NT. All uses point consistently toward a temporary, pre-resurrection holding state:
- Luke 10:15 ("thrust down to hell/hades")
- Matthew 11:23 (same)
- Matthew 16:18 ("gates of hades shall not prevail")
- Acts 2:27, 31 (Christ's soul in hades until resurrection)
- Revelation 1:18 (Christ has keys of death and hades)
- Revelation 6:8 (death and hades as paired entities)
- Revelation 20:13-14 (hades delivers up the dead; hades cast into the lake of fire)

The Acts 2:27, 31 passages (E131) are same-author (Luke) parallels to Luke 16:23. Luke himself quotes Psalm 16:10 ("thou wilt not leave my soul in hell") and applies it to Christ's experience in hades between death and resurrection. Luke's understanding of hades is thus clearly: the soul enters hades at death and is released at resurrection. This is the framework within which to read Luke 16.

### G5490 chasma — Hapax Legomenon

The "great gulf" (chasma, G5490) occurs only in Luke 16:26 in all of Scripture. This vocabulary uniqueness is itself notable: if this were providing precise doctrinal information about a literal afterlife geography, we would expect at least some corroboration in other passages. The hapax status of this key term indicates that the specific imagery is unique to this passage — drawing from the intertestamental tradition rather than establishing a new doctrinal datum.

### G2859 kolpos — Abraham's Bosom

Kolpos (G2859) elsewhere in John 1:18 (the Son "in the bosom of the Father") and John 13:23 (the beloved disciple "in the bosom of Jesus") establishes that this is an idiom for the place of intimate fellowship and honor — not a geographic location but a relational position. Lazarus is in the position of intimate honor with the father of the faith — a relational metaphor entirely appropriate to parabolic narration.

---

## Section 6: Hades, N026, and the Limits of Literalism

Even if the passage is taken as entirely literal, a crucial constraint applies: the location described is hades (G86), not the lake of fire.

N026 (established in etc5-04): Hades is a temporary holding state that (a) receives the dead at death, (b) holds them until resurrection-judgment, (c) delivers them up at the resurrection, and (d) is itself cast into the lake of fire (Rev 20:13-14).

The sequence from Revelation 20:
- v.13: "The sea gave up the dead... and death and hell [hades] delivered up the dead which were in them."
- v.14: "And death and hell [hades] were cast into the lake of fire."

If the rich man in Luke 16 is in pre-resurrection hades — which the text explicitly says he is (en tō Haidē, v.23) — then even on a completely literal reading:

1. This describes the pre-resurrection intermediate state, not the final judgment.
2. The rich man's five brothers are still alive (v.28) — placing this definitively in the pre-resurrection period.
3. The narrative cannot be used to prove *eternal* conscious torment as the *final* fate of the wicked — only (at most) conscious torment in the *temporary* hades.

This constraint means that even ECT interpreters who take Luke 16 literally are not using it to prove the final fate of the wicked from this passage alone. They are using it to prove a *conscious intermediate state* (IB001) — a different question, which has already been resolved Moderate AGAINST in etc5-04.

Matthew 8:29 provides a relevant parallel: the demons cry out, "Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?" (πρὸ καιροῦ βασανίσαι ἡμᾶς). The demons explicitly acknowledge that their permanent torment is a future eschatological event — "before the time" implies that the time of permanent torment has not yet come. This is consistent with the Revelation sequence: the permanent state comes at the final judgment, not in the intermediate pre-resurrection period.

## Section 7: Paradise (Luke 23:43) and Abraham's Bosom

Luke 23:43: "And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise" (Ἀμήν σοι λέγω, σήμερον μετ' ἐμοῦ ἔσῃ ἐν τῷ Παραδείσῳ).

Paradise (G3857, paradeisos) occurs only 3 times in the NT: Luke 23:43; 2 Corinthians 12:4; Revelation 2:7. It does NOT appear in Luke 16 at all. "Abraham's bosom" (kolpos) is the only description of the righteous dead's location in Luke 16. The equation of "Abraham's bosom" with "paradise" is not stated by any biblical text.

Three distinct observations:

**First:** The word paradise does not appear in Luke 16. The BLB database erroneously lists Luke 16:23 under G3857's biblical usage, but this is a database error — the word paradeisos does not appear in the verse.

**Second:** 2 Corinthians 12:4 places paradise in "the third heaven" (v.2) — not in a compartment of pre-resurrection hades but in the highest heaven. This makes the equation of Luke 16's "Abraham's bosom" (in hades) with Paul's paradise (in the third heaven) a complex theological inference with no explicit textual support.

**Third:** Acts 2:31 (same author as Luke 23:43) states that Christ's soul was "not left in hell [hades]" — implying it was in hades until the resurrection. If Christ was in hades between Good Friday and resurrection, and Luke 23:43 says the thief would be with Christ "today," then either: (a) "today" in Luke 23:43 refers to the day of Christ's return at resurrection (with the comma placed before "today"), or (b) the thief was with Christ in hades specifically. Neither option supports the simple equation of "Abraham's bosom" with the paradise of 2 Cor 12:4 as an intermediate heavenly state. This tension is within Luke's own corpus (Luke-Acts).

---

## Section 8: Phil 1:23 and 2 Cor 5:8

These two passages (E038 and E039 in the master evidence) are passages cited for conscious intermediate state (IB001):
- 2 Cor 5:8: "willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord"
- Phil 1:23: "a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better"

These items are already classified in the master evidence and their IB001 relevance has been analyzed in etc5-04. The present study does not add new observations about these texts. IB001's resolution (Moderate AGAINST conscious intermediate state) was established with full consideration of E038 and E039.

For the present study, only one new observation is added: the "also In" field for IB001 should include etc5-09, because the resolution of IB006 depends in part on IB001's prior resolution. If the conscious intermediate state in general has been established only at Moderate AGAINST, then using Luke 16 as a literalistic account of that state requires overriding IB001's resolution — which itself requires stronger E/N support than is present.

---

## Section 9: The Theological Point (Moses and the Prophets, vv.29-31)

The passage's own stated purpose is the most important single datum for genre classification. The narrative concludes not with a revelation about the afterlife but with a statement about the present responsibility of the living:

"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them" (v.29).
"If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead" (v.31).

This is addressed to the covetous Pharisees (v.14-15) who have rejected Jesus's teaching about the right use of wealth. The narrative is a warning: the covetous rich who ignore the poor (represented by the rich man and Lazarus) are like the Pharisees who have Moses and the Prophets but do not hear them. Even a resurrection from the dead — a direct allusion to Jesus' own coming resurrection and to the raising of Lazarus of Bethany — will not persuade those who refuse to hear.

The narrative's stated purpose is prophetic and hortatory: hear Moses and the Prophets. The afterlife imagery (hades, Abraham's bosom, the gulf) is the vehicle for this message, not the message itself.

This is a standard feature of parables: they use narrative reality (whether fictional or historical) to make a theological point. The Prodigal Son uses a narrative about a human family to make a point about God's love and the Pharisees' attitude toward sinners. The story details are subordinate to the theological purpose.

---

## Section 10: IB006 Full SIS Resolution (5-Step)

### Step 1: Identify the Tension

**FOR a literal reading of Luke 16 as a factual intermediate-state description:**
- E123 (Luke 16:23-25): The rich man in hades is explicitly described as conscious, in torments, seeing Abraham, recognizing Lazarus, engaging in dialogue. The text presents this as a coherent scene with physical-like details. Both sides acknowledge E123 as an Explicit Statement.
- E220 (NEW — Luke 16:20): Lazarus is named — the only named human character in any parable of Jesus.
- E222 (NEW — Luke 16:26): The great gulf is "fixed" (perfect passive — estēríktai) — a permanent completed state.

**AGAINST a literal reading (FOR a parabolic/genre interpretation):**
- E224 (NEW — Luke 15:3): The single parabolē label at Luke 15:3 introduces three consecutive parables (lost sheep, lost coin, prodigal son), none of which are individually re-labeled. Luke's practice shows that parabolē does not need to be repeated for each unit in a connected series.
- E225 (NEW — Luke 12:16): The opening formula "a certain rich man" is *explicitly* labeled a parable in Luke 12:16. The same literary formula that opens Luke 16:19 is, in Luke 12:16, unambiguously marked as parabolē by the same author.
- E223 (NEW — Luke 16:29-31): The stated theological purpose of the narrative is the sufficiency of Moses and the Prophets, not a description of afterlife geography.
- E219 (NEW — Luke 16:19): The opening formula is identical to the Dishonest Steward (Luke 16:1, unlabeled) and echoes the Rich Fool (Luke 12:16, labeled).
- E229 (NEW — Luke 16:14-15): The immediate audience is the covetous, deriding Pharisees — the narrative is a response to a live confrontation with self-justifying Pharisees.
- E017 (Ecc 9:5): "The dead know not any thing" — Plain, Conditionalist
- E013 (Psa 146:4): "His thoughts perish" — Plain, Conditionalist
- E020 (Job 14:12): "They shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep" — Plain, Conditionalist
- E130 (Acts 2:29): David "dead and buried" as of Pentecost, in hades — Plain, Conditionalist
- E131 (Acts 2:31): Christ's soul was in hades until resurrection — Plain, Conditionalist (same author as Luke 16)
- N026 (hades = temporary): Established in etc5-04
- N023 (dead lack consciousness): Established in etc5-03, multiple independent authors

### Step 2: Assess Clarity

Clarity is assessed by: directness of vocabulary, genre (didactic > apocalyptic > parabolic), scope, frequency, self-interpretation.

**E123 (Rich Man conscious in hades):**
- What it explicitly says: the text describes the rich man as conscious, in torments, seeing Abraham.
- Genre: parabolic narrative (connected to the parabolic discourse beginning at Luke 15:3, with the same literary formula as the explicitly-labeled Luke 12:16 parable, in a context where parabolic narrative is the established mode).
- This is **Contextually Clear** — the content is explicit but the genre context introduces interpretive ambiguity. It cannot be rated Plain because both sides acknowledge that parabolic texts use realistic imagery (the Prodigal Son's father "ran and embraced" his son — no one takes this as a literal proof that old men can run).

**E224 (Luke 15:3 covers consecutive parables without repeated label):**
- This is a direct, observable grammatical-literary fact: Luke 15:3 has parabolē, Luke 15:4-32 has three consecutive parables, none re-labeled. Universal acknowledgment. **Plain**.

**E225 (Luke 12:16 explicitly labels "certain rich man" as parabolē):**
- This is a direct, observable textual fact: Luke 12:16 has both the "rich man" formula AND the explicit parabolē label. **Plain**.

**E223 (Luke 16:29-31 stated theological purpose):**
- The text explicitly states its own purpose in v.29 and v.31. Both sides must acknowledge these are the concluding verses and that they are about Moses and the Prophets. **Plain**.

**E017, E013, E020 (state-of-the-dead passages):**
- These are unqualified direct statements about the dead's state, from independent authors. **Plain**, as established in prior studies.

**E130, E131 (Acts 2:29,31 — same author as Luke):**
- Direct, explicit statements by Peter quoting a Psalm. **Plain**.

### Step 3: Count and Weigh

FOR literal reading:
- 1 Contextually Clear item (E123)
- 1 unusual but not decisive feature (E220 — Lazarus named)
- 1 grammatical observation about a perfect passive (E222 — gulf is fixed)

AGAINST literal reading / FOR parabolic reading:
- 2 Plain genre items directly establishing Lukan parabolic practice for this exact type of narrative (E224, E225)
- 1 Plain stated-purpose item (E223) — the text's own internal hermeneutical signal
- 5+ Plain state-of-the-dead items from 3+ independent authors (E017, E013, E020, E130, E131)
- N026 (Contextually Clear — hades = temporary holding state)
- N023 (Conditionalist — multiple independent authors assert the dead lack consciousness)

The weight is:
- FOR literal: 1 Contextually Clear item + 2 supporting Neutral observations
- AGAINST literal: 2 Plain genre items + 1 Plain purpose item + 5+ Plain state-of-the-dead items + 2 N items (one Contextually Clear, one plain)

### Step 4: Apply SIS Cross-References

SIS (Scripture Interprets Scripture) connections:

**#4a — Intra-Lukan connections (same author, verified textual):**

1. **Luke 12:16 → Luke 16:19 (E225):** The same author (Luke), in the same Gospel, uses the identical "certain rich man" formula in 12:16 and explicitly labels it a parabolē. The labeled instance governs the genre of the unlabeled instance with the same formula. This is a direct #4a SIS connection: same vocabulary, same formula, same author, labeled instance clarifies unlabeled instance.

2. **Luke 15:3 → Luke 16:19 (E224):** Luke's established practice of covering a series of connected parables with one parabolē label at the beginning (lost sheep, lost coin, prodigal son — all under the single label at 15:3) means the absence of parabolē in 16:19 does not signal a different genre. The prodigal son is universally accepted as a parable without its own label; the same logic applies here.

3. **Acts 2:31 → Luke 16:23 (E131):** The same author who wrote Luke 16:23 (the rich man in hades) also wrote Acts 2:31 (Christ's soul was in hades until resurrection). Luke's understanding of hades is consistent: it is the temporary holding state. The Acts 2:31 passage governs the reading of Luke 16:23 — hades is where souls remain until resurrection, not a final conscious state.

4. **Luke 16:29-31 self-interpretation (E223):** The passage itself states its theological purpose. This is the strongest possible SIS connection: the text interprets itself. The stated point is not the afterlife but the sufficiency of Moses and the Prophets.

**#4a — Cross-author SIS (verified textual parallels):**

5. **E017/E013/E020 governing E123:** The plain state-of-the-dead passages (multiple independent authors) establish the general principle that the dead lack consciousness. A parabolic narrative that appears to depict conscious activity in hades is governed by the more numerous, plain, didactic texts from multiple independent authors. The single-narrative impression of conscious activity does not override the cumulative plain evidence from Ecclesiastes, Psalms, and Job.

6. **IB001 context (Moderate AGAINST conscious intermediate state):** IB001 has already been resolved Moderate AGAINST in etc5-04. The general question of a conscious intermediate state has been weighed across all relevant evidence and the weight was AGAINST. A literal reading of Luke 16 as proof of a conscious intermediate state now constitutes an exception claim — requiring additional E/N support to override the prior resolution. The available additional support (E123) is Contextually Clear, not Plain, and is insufficient to reverse a prior Moderate resolution.

### Step 5: State the Resolution

**IB006 Resolution: Moderate — weight toward parabolic/literary genre interpretation.**

**Reasoning:**

The FOR-literal side has one Contextually Clear item (E123) plus two supporting observations that are genuine but not decisive (E220 — naming, E222 — fixed gulf).

The FOR-parabolic side has:
- Two Plain genre items (E224, E225) establishing that Luke uses this exact literary formula in contexts explicitly labeled as parabolic, and that Luke does not re-label each unit in a connected parabolic series
- One Plain self-interpretation item (E223) — the passage states its own theological purpose
- Five-plus Plain state-of-the-dead items from 3+ independent authors
- Two confirmed N items (N026 — hades temporary; N023 — dead lack consciousness)
- Four #4a SIS connections within Luke-Acts and across the biblical canon

The Plain items govern the Contextually Clear item. Multiple Plain witnesses from multiple independent authors addressing the same subject (consciousness in death) outweigh a single Contextually Clear item from a parabolic narrative context.

**Why NOT Strong:** The naming of Lazarus (E220) is genuinely unusual — no other parable of Jesus names a human character. This cannot be simply dismissed. The detailed dialogue and the specific geographical imagery (hades, Abraham's bosom, the gulf) are more elaborate than many parables. These factors introduce genuine uncertainty that prevents Strong resolution. The Contextually Clear status of E123 (rather than Ambiguous) reflects real evidential weight on the FOR-literal side.

**Why Moderate (not Unresolved):** The prior Unresolved status (etc5-03 through etc5-08) was appropriate when the evidence had not been fully examined through the specific tools available to this study. Now, with the full analysis:
- E225 (Luke 12:16 = same formula explicitly labeled parable) is a direct, Plain intra-Lukan SIS connection that was not fully articulated in prior studies.
- E224 (Luke 15:3 covers consecutive unlabeled parables) establishes the specific Lukan practice that explains the absence of a parabolē label.
- The stated purpose (E223) is an internal hermeneutical signal within the passage itself.
- The SIS connections within Luke-Acts (Acts 2:31 governing Luke 16:23) are direct #4a connections from the same author.

These convergent lines of evidence — same-formula parallel explicitly labeled as parable (E225), established Lukan practice of covering parabolic series with single label (E224), stated purpose as sufficiency of Scripture (E223), same-author hades understanding (E131) — collectively shift the IB006 resolution from Unresolved to Moderate.

**Classification note:** IB006 carries the ECT directional label (the claim that the passage is literally describing the intermediate state is the ECT/conscious-intermediate-state position). The Moderate resolution is weight AGAINST that claim — i.e., weight toward the parabolic interpretation.

## Summary of New Evidence Items

The following new items are established by this study's analysis and will be added to the master evidence file:

**E-tier (Explicit, Neutral unless noted):**
- **E219** [Neutral]: Luke 16:19 opening formula matches Lukan parabolic pattern
- **E220** [Neutral]: Lazarus is the only named human character in any parable of Jesus
- **E221** [Neutral]: Luke 16:22 — deaths of both, Lazarus carried by angels to Abraham's bosom, rich man buried
- **E222** [Neutral]: Luke 16:26 — G5490 chasma (hapax legomenon) + ἐστήρικται (perfect passive = permanently fixed)
- **E223** [Neutral]: Luke 16:29-31 — stated theological purpose: sufficiency of Moses and the Prophets
- **E224** [Neutral]: Luke 15:3 introduces three consecutive parables under one parabolē label (lost sheep, lost coin, prodigal son all follow without repeated parabolē label)
- **E225** [Neutral]: Luke 12:16 explicitly labels "certain rich man" narrative as a parabolē — same opening formula as Luke 16:19
- **E226** [Neutral]: Matthew 8:29 — demons acknowledge permanent torment is a future eschatological event ("before the time")
- **E227** [Neutral]: Luke 16 uses G931 basanos (v.23,28) and G3600 odunaomai (v.24); G929 basanismos (the Revelation torment noun) does not appear in Luke 16
- **E228** [Conditionalist]: Hebrews 11:13 — "died in faith, not having received the promises"; Heb 11:40 — "that they without us should not be made perfect"
- **E229** [Neutral]: Luke 16:14-15 — immediate audience identified as covetous Pharisees who derided Jesus
- **E230** [Neutral]: paradeisos (G3857) does not appear in Luke 16; "Abraham's bosom" (kolpos) is never explicitly equated with paradise in any biblical text

**N-tier:**
- **N038** [Neutral]: Even on a literal reading, Luke 16 describes hades (G86, the temporary pre-resurrection holding state per N026), not the lake of fire; it cannot directly establish eternal conscious torment as the final post-judgment state

**I-B resolution:**
- **IB006**: Changed from Unresolved → **Moderate — weight toward parabolic/literary genre interpretation (not literal hades description)**
