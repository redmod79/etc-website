```

**Analysis:** The OT parallels for Luke 16:23 are weak (max 0.346) and are driven primarily by keyword matches on "abraham" and "eye/see" — not by any semantic parallel to hades, torment, or intermediate-state theology. No OT passage provides a direct parallel to the hades-torment imagery. This confirms that the passage's specific afterlife geography does not derive from OT textual parallels, but rather from intertestamental Jewish literature (not indexed in this tool) and/or from Jesus's own teaching.

**Analysis:** Top NT parallels are other Luke 16 verses and Acts 2:27,31 (hades) and Rev 6:8 (hades). John 12:9 appears because it mentions "Lazarus" (the Bethany Lazarus). Acts 2:31 has "hade" as a key term match — confirming the strongest NT parallel for hades-after-death is Peter's Pentecost sermon.

**Analysis:** Extremely weak parallels (max 0.304), all driven by common words (pass, there, able). No OT passage speaks of a great gulf in the afterlife separating the righteous and wicked. This confirms that the chasma concept is unique to Luke 16:26 (hapax) and has no clear OT textual antecedent.

**Analysis:** Very weak parallels (max 0.324). No NT passage contains a close parallel to the great gulf concept. The hapax legomenon status of chasma (G5490) is confirmed: there are no comparable passages in the NT database.

```

**Analysis:** Strong matches (0.425) driven by "hear + Moses" and "hear + prophet" terms. The OT parallels are all passages involving Moses being heard or obeyed, and prophets being heeded — consistent with the theme of v.29. The passage's point (obey Moses and the prophets) resonates with the entire OT prophetic tradition calling Israel to heed the Law.

**Analysis:** Luke 16:29-31 form a tightly connected cluster (16:29 → 16:31: 0.507). The Moses-and-prophets theme links to Luke 20:37 (Moses at the bush, resurrection argument), Luke 24:27,44 (Christ expounding Moses and prophets), Acts 3:22 (Moses as prophet like Jesus). This confirms that the passage's THEOLOGICAL POINT is about the sufficiency of revelation through Moses and the prophets.

```

**Analysis:** Acts 28:23 (0.433) is notable — "persuad, mose, prophet" — Paul at Rome "persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets." The theme of being persuaded (or failing to be persuaded) through Moses and the prophets runs throughout Luke-Acts. Luke 16:31 is the foundation statement; Acts 28:23 is a near-fulfillment.

```

**Analysis:** The NT parallels are mostly driven by "said + truly" (the Amen formula) or "today" — common terms. The word "paradise" (G3857) doesn't drive strong semantic parallels because it appears only 3 times in the NT. Hebrews 4:7 (0.361) "today, if ye will hear his voice" is a Psalm 95 quotation; the "today" (sēmeron) connection is interesting given the comma debate in Luke 23:43.

**Analysis:** Weak OT parallels (max 0.352) driven by "desire" vocabulary. No OT passage speaks of departure at death to be with the Lord as a specific theological construct.

**Analysis:** The NT parallels link to surrounding Philippians context (PHP 1:21 — "to live is Christ, to die is gain") and general Pauline Christology. The phrase "to depart and be with Christ" is a Pauline unique construction — no direct NT parallel.

## Acts 2:31 — OT Parallels

HYBRID ANALYSIS OT PARALLELS FOR: ACT 2:31
Glosses: Having foreseen he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ that neither was He abandoned into Hades...

Max score: 0.266 (very weak matches on "flesh" keyword)
```

**Analysis:** Very weak OT parallels. The passage is quoting/expositing Psalm 16:10 ("thou wilt not leave my soul in hell"), but the semantic parallel tool did not score that connection highly because the parallel is in Acts 2:27 (direct quote) rather than 2:31.

...
```

**Analysis:** Acts 2:27 (direct pair) scores highest (0.493). Acts 2:31 is connected to the resurrection of Christ (1 Cor 15:12,13), confirming that the hades reference in Acts 2:27,31 is specifically about Christ's resurrection — not a general teaching on the intermediate state. LUK 16:23 scores 0.369 because it also contains "hade" — confirming that Luke 16:23 and Acts 2:27,31 share the same hades vocabulary.
