## Luke 16:23 — Concept Context

```
CONCEPT CONTEXT: Luke 16:23
"And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
Book: Luke | Chapter: 16 | Author: Luke

CONCEPTS IN THIS VERSE:
  DEATH: Maveth/thanatos - death, dying
    Strong's: G86 (hell)

SAME CHAPTER (Luke 16) (1 verses):
  1. Luke 16:22 [DEATH]
     "And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"

SAME BOOK (Luke) (18 verses):
  1. Luke 1:79 [DEATH] "...shadow of death..."
  2. Luke 10:15 [DEATH] "Capernaum...shalt be thrust down to hell"
  3. Luke 2:26 [DEATH] "not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ"
  4. Luke 20:28 [DEATH] "If any man's brother die..."
  5. Luke 20:29-32 [DEATH] — seven brothers and death without children
  6. Luke 20:36 [DEATH] "Neither can they die any more" (resurrection passage)
  7. Luke 21:16 [DEATH] "shall they cause to be put to death"

SAME AUTHOR (Luke) (13 verses including):
  1. Acts 13:28 [DEATH]
  2. Acts 2:24 [DEATH] "having loosed the pains of death"
  3. Acts 2:27 [DEATH] "thou wilt not leave my soul in hell"
  4. Acts 2:31 [DEATH] "his soul was not left in hell"
  5. Acts 21:13 [DEATH]
  6. Acts 22:4 [DEATH]
  7. Acts 23:29 [DEATH]
  8. Acts 25:11 [DEATH]
```

**Analysis notes:**
- Concept extraction identifies G86 (hades) under the DEATH concept
- The tool finds only one other verse in the same chapter with the DEATH concept: Luke 16:22
- Critical observation: Acts 2:27 and 2:31 appear as same-author parallels — both mention the soul in hell (hades)
- Luke 20:36 ("neither can they die any more") is also flagged — the resurrection passage in the same book
- The concept context tool does not find Luke 23:43 (paradise) as a parallel here — because paradise (G3857) is not in the DEATH concept category in this tool's framework

## Luke 23:43 — Concept Context

```
CONCEPT CONTEXT: Luke 23:43
"And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise."
Book: Luke | Chapter: 23 | Author: Luke

CONCEPTS IN THIS VERSE:
  WORD: Dabar/logos - word, matter, thing
    Strong's: G3004 (I say)

SAME CHAPTER (Luke 23) (14 verses with WORD concept — mostly "saying"):
  Verses with "saying" verbs: Luke 23:2,3,18,21,30,34,35,37,39,40...

SAME BOOK (Luke) (249 verses with WORD concept):
  Mostly general "saying/speaking" verses throughout Luke
```

**Analysis notes:**
- The concept tool extracts only the WORD concept (logos/dabar from G3004 legō) for Luke 23:43
- This is because paradise (G3857) and "today" (sēmeron, G4594) are not mapped to theological concept categories in the tool's framework
- The result: 249 verses in Luke with the "saying" concept — too general to be useful
- The verse's theological content (paradise, "today," "with me") is not captured by this tool for this verse
- More useful context for Luke 23:43 comes from the direct passage reading and the parallel tool

## Additional Context — Luke 16 Pericope Structure

The following shows Luke 16's overall structure relevant to the genre question:

```
Luke 16:1-13: Parable of the Dishonest Steward
  Opening: "There was a certain rich man" (Anthropos tis ēn plousios)
  Audience: Disciples (v.1)
  No parabolē label

Luke 16:14-15: Transition — Pharisees mock
  "The Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him"

Luke 16:16-18: Three bridge sayings
  Law/prophets → kingdom of God (v.16)
  Law's permanence (v.17)
  Adultery/divorce saying (v.18)

Luke 16:19-31: Rich Man and Lazarus
  Opening: "There was a certain rich man" (Anthropos de tis ēn plousios)
  Audience: Pharisees (cf. v.14 context)
  No parabolē label
  Conclusion returns to "Moses and the prophets" (vv.29,31)
```

The Law/Prophets frame (16:16-18 intro → 16:29,31 conclusion) brackets the entire Rich Man/Lazarus narrative, supporting the interpretation that the narrative's PRIMARY PURPOSE is to make a point about Moses and the prophets as sufficient revelation, not to give a doctrinal description of the intermediate state.

## Nave's SELF-INDULGENCE Connection

Nave's SELF-INDULGENCE entry links Luke 16:19 to Luke 12:16-20 (the Rich Fool parable). For reference, the Rich Fool passage:

```
Luke 12:16 — And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
Luke 12:17 — And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
Luke 12:18 — And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.
Luke 12:19 — And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, [and] be merry.
Luke 12:20 — But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?
```

**Comparison of Luke 12:16 and Luke 16:19:**
- Both are "a certain rich man" narratives
- Luke 12:16 has EXPLICIT parabolē label ("he spake a parable")
- Luke 16:19 has NO parabolē label
- Both involve the wealthy man's enjoyment and sudden death
- Both are followed by commentary on true wealth vs. earthly wealth
- Nave's implicitly treats Luke 16:19 the same way as Luke 12:16 (both under SELF-INDULGENCE)

This Nave's connection supports the parabolic reading: Luke 16:19ff is genre-paralleled with Luke 12:16-20 (explicitly a parable) in Nave's topical organization.
