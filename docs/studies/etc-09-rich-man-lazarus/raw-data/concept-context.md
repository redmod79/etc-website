# Raw Concept Context Output

"And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."

### Concepts Found
- **DEATH:** Maveth/thanatos - death, dying (Strong's: G86 = hades/"hell")

### Same Chapter (Luke 16) -- 1 verse
1. **Luke 16:22** [DEATH] -- "And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"

### Same Book (Luke) -- 18 verses (top 10)
1. **Luke 1:79** [DEATH] -- "To give light to them that sit in darkness and [in] the shadow of death"
2. **Luke 10:15** [DEATH] -- "shalt be thrust down to hell" (another Lukan hades passage)
3. **Luke 2:26** [DEATH] -- "should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ"
4. **Luke 20:28-32** [DEATH] -- levirate marriage discussion involving death
5. **Luke 20:36** [DEATH] -- "Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels"

### Same Author (Luke-Acts) -- 13 verses (top highlights)
1. **Acts 13:28** [DEATH] -- "found no cause of death [in him]"
2. **Acts 2:24** [DEATH] -- "God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death"
3. **Acts 2:27** [DEATH] -- "thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [hades]" (KEY: same author uses hades in didactic context of resurrection)
4. **Acts 2:31** [DEATH] -- "his soul was not left in hell [hades]" (KEY: same author, didactic, resurrection context)

### Key Observation
The concept_context tool connects Luke 16:23 to Acts 2:27,31 through the shared concept of DEATH (hades). This is same-author evidence: Luke uses hades in Luke 16:23 (parabolic narrative) and in Acts 2:27,31 (Peter's didactic speech about Christ's resurrection from the dead). The Acts passages use hades as the temporary state from which Christ was raised -- not as a place of conscious torment.

### Key Observations
1. Luke 16:31's four concepts (OBEDIENCE, PROPHET, FAITH, RESURRECTION) connect to a vast network of passages about hearing/obeying the prophets and believing
2. The strongest same-author connections are Acts 3:22, 7:37, and 28:23 -- all about Moses, the prophets, persuasion, and resurrection
3. Luke 24:25 ("slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken") directly parallels Luke 16:31 ("if they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded")
4. The passage's self-identified teaching point (hear Moses and the prophets) is thoroughly corroborated by same-author and cross-biblical evidence as a central theme about the authority of Scripture
