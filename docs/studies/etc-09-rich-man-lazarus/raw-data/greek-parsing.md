## Luke 16:19 — Opening Formula

**Notes:**
- "Ἄνθρωπος δέ τις ἦν πλούσιος" = "There was a certain man [who was] rich" — the standard opening formula for Lukan parables
- Compare Luke 16:1: "ἄνθρωπός τις ἦν πλούσιος" (slightly different word order, same formula)
- No word for "parable" (parabolē, G3850) appears in this verse or its immediate context
- "ἦν" = imperfect (was) — narrative past tense, consistent with parabolic story-telling
- "ἐνεδιδύσκετο" = imperfect middle — "he was habitually clothing himself" (continuous past action)

**Notes:**
- "ἀπενεχθῆναι αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀγγέλων" = "to be carried away by the angels" — aorist passive infinitive, indicating divine action
- "εἰς τὸν κόλπον Ἀβραάμ" = "into the bosom of Abraham" — accusative of destination
- "ἐτάφη" = "was buried" — aorist passive, simple statement. Notably, only the rich man is said to be buried; Lazarus's burial is not mentioned.
- The asymmetry: Lazarus is carried by angels → Abraham's bosom; the rich man dies and is buried (end of earthly dignity)

**Notes:**
- "ἐν τῷ Ἅιδῃ" = "in hades" — dative (locative) of place. The word is G86 ᾅδης, explicitly hades.
- "ὑπάρχων ἐν βασάνοις" = "being in torments" — present active participle of ὑπάρχω (to exist, to be) + dative plural of G931 βάσανος (basanos). The present participle indicates ongoing state in the narrative. Torment word is G931 basanos, NOT G928 basanizō or G929 basanismos.
- "ὁρᾷ" = "he sees" — present active indicative. Within the narrative, he is currently seeing Abraham.
- "ἐν τοῖς κόλποις αὐτοῦ" = "in his bosoms" (dative plural of kolpos) — the plural form here may be idiomatic, or may reflect the reclining-at-table posture
- Note: "Lazarus" is G2976 Λάζαρος — the only named parable figure in the NT

## Luke 16:24 — Flame and Anguish

```
Greek Text: καὶ αὐτὸς φωνήσας εἶπεν Πάτερ Ἀβραάμ, ἐλέησόν με καὶ πέμψον Λάζαρον ἵνα βάψῃ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ δακτύλου αὐτοῦ ὕδατος καὶ καταψύξῃ τὴν γλῶσσάν μου, ὅτι ὀδυνῶμαι ἐν τῇ φλογὶ ταύτῃ.

Key words:
- ὀδυνῶμαι (G3600 odunaomai) = "I am in anguish/pain" — pres pass ind 1st sg — a DIFFERENT word from basanos
- φλογὶ (G5395 phlox) = "flame" — the rich man is in a flame
- βάψῃ (G911 baptō) = "dip" — aorist active subjunctive (of purpose after ἵνα)
- δακτύλου (G1147 daktylos) = "finger" — the physical detail of the finger
- γλῶσσάν (G1100 glōssa) = "tongue" — cooling the tongue

Full parsing table above (see main session output).
```

**Notes:**
- "ὀδυνῶμαι ἐν τῇ φλογὶ ταύτῃ" = "I am tormented/anguished in this flame" — present passive indicative. G3600 odunaomai means acute pain or grief; it is used at Luke 2:48 (parents distressed searching for Jesus) and Acts 20:38 (believers grieving Paul's departure).
- The THIRD torment-related expression in the narrative, and yet a different word from basanos (v.23) — showing variety in vocabulary for suffering
- "βάψῃ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ δακτύλου" = "might dip the tip of the finger" — the physical impossibility noted by commentators: a spirit with a finger, a tongue, a flame, and a drop of water
- ECT position: These are accommodations to human understanding — real spiritual realities described in physical terms
- Conditionalist position: Physical impossibilities (disembodied spirits with fingers and tongues) are markers of parabolic/illustrative fiction

## Luke 16:26 — The Great Gulf Fixed

```
Greek Text: καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις μεταξὺ ἡμῶν καὶ ὑμῶν χάσμα μέγα ἐστήρικται, ὅπως οἱ θέλοντες διαβῆναι ἔνθεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς μὴ δύνωνται, μηδὲ ἐκεῖθεν πρὸς ἡμᾶς διαπερῶσιν.

```

**Notes:**
- "χάσμα μέγα" = "a great gulf/chasm" — G5490 (hapax) + megas (great)
- "ἐστήρικται" = PERFECT PASSIVE INDICATIVE of stērizō (to fix firmly, establish). This is the grammatically significant form:
  - Perfect tense = completed action with ongoing results
  - Passive voice = fixed by an external agent (by God)
  - Indicative mood = statement of fact
  - Result: the gulf WAS fixed (in the past) and REMAINS fixed (in the present). This is permanent, irrevocable.
- "οἱ θέλοντες διαβῆναι" = "those wishing to cross over" — present active participle of thelō + aorist active infinitive of diabainō
- "μὴ δύνωνται" = "are not able" — present m/p subjunctive, negated
- Two-directional: neither from one side to the other (ἔνθεν...ὑμᾶς) NOR from the other side to us (ἐκεῖθεν...ἡμᾶς)

```

**Notes:**
- "ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῇ" = "rise from [the] dead" — aorist active subjunctive of anistēmi (to raise up, arise). This is the resurrection vocabulary (anistēmi/anastasis).
- "πεισθήσονται" = "they will be persuaded" — future passive indicative. Negative: "they will NOT be persuaded"
- The condition: "if they hear not Moses and the prophets" (1st class conditional: εἰ + indicative = assumed as reality)
- The conclusion: even a resurrection will not persuade them
- This is the STATED PURPOSE and THEOLOGICAL POINT of the entire narrative — Moses and the prophets are sufficient revelation; rejection of them is not overcome by miracles
- Proleptic reference: "though one rose from the dead" — Jesus's own resurrection; also historically, the Lazarus of Bethany was raised (John 11) and the chief priests immediately plotted to kill him (John 12:10)

**Notes:**
- παραβολὴν (G3850) — accusative singular — explicitly labels the following material as a parable
- "ταύτην" = "this" — demonstrative, pointing to what follows
- Luke 15:3 introduces the ENTIRE pericope of Luke 15:4-32 (lost sheep, lost coin, prodigal son) under ONE parabole label
- The Prodigal Son (15:11-32) has NO separate parabolē introduction and is universally accepted as a parable
- This demonstrates the Lukan pattern: a section can be parabolic even without a repeated parabolē label

**Notes on the comma debate:**
- Greek: "Ἀμήν σοι λέγω, σήμερον μετ' ἐμοῦ ἔσῃ ἐν τῷ Παραδείσῳ"
- Standard reading: "Verily I say unto thee, TODAY shalt thou be with me in paradise" — σήμερον (today) modifies ἔσῃ (you will be)
- Alternative reading: "Verily I say unto thee TODAY, thou shalt be with me in paradise" — σήμερον (today) modifies λέγω (I say)
- Grammatically, σήμερον as an adverb naturally attaches to the nearest verb — ἔσῃ is the predicate of the main clause, λέγω is a subordinate parenthetical formula
- Most Greek grammarians read the sentence with "today" modifying "you will be" — the ECT reading
- However, the alternative cannot be ruled out grammatically; Greek does not have comma punctuation; the placement of σήμερον between the discourse formula and the promise is ambiguous
- "ἔσῃ" = future middle indicative 2nd person singular of εἰμί (to be) — "you will be"
- "ἐν τῷ Παραδείσῳ" = "in the paradise" — dative (locative) — paradise as a specific named location

**Notes:**
- "τὸ ἀναλῦσαι" = "to depart" — articular aorist active infinitive of ἀναλύω (G360, to unloose/depart) — the article τό makes it a nominalized infinitive
- "σὺν Χριστῷ εἶναι" = "to be with Christ" — articular present active infinitive of εἰμί, with σύν (with) + dative
- The coordination of these two infinitives ("to depart AND to be with Christ") in a single articular construction joined by καί strongly suggests they are a single event or consecutive/immediate events
- "πολλῷ μᾶλλον κρεῖσσον" = "much more better" — the emphatic judgment that death/departure leads immediately to something far better
- Key question: Does this express subjective experience (death feels immediate in God's sight) or objective chronology (no gap between death and conscious presence with Christ)?
- The grammar does not resolve this; both readings are possible
