**Key observation:** Nave's lists the parable as a standard literary form used throughout Scripture by multiple authors. Jesus' parables follow this established biblical tradition.

### LAZARUS
- 1. Brother of Mary and Martha. Sickness and death of: Jhn 11:1-14. Resurrection of: Jhn 11:38-44; 12:17,18. Had dinner with Jesus: Jhn 12:1,2,9. Plotted against by the chief priests: Jhn 12:10,11.

**Key observation:** Nave's lists ONLY ONE Lazarus -- the brother of Mary and Martha in John 11-12. The "Lazarus" of Luke 16 does NOT receive a separate historical entry. This is consistent with the parabolic reading where "Lazarus" is a character name (meaning "God helps") chosen for its thematic significance, not a reference to a separate historical individual.

### HADES
- 1. The unseen world, translated "hell" in AV, but in RV the word "Hades" is retained: Mat 10:28; 11:23; 16:18; Luk 10:15; 16:23; Act 2:27,31; Rev 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14. See HELL.
- 2. The realm (state) of the dead: 2 Sam 22:6; Job 26:5; Psa 6:5; 17:15; 30:9; 49:15; 86:13; 88:10-12; 115:17; 116:3; Pro 15:24; 21:16; 27:20; Ecc 9:4-6; Isa 5:14; Jon 2:2; Luk 23:42,43; Jhn 8:22; 2 Cor 12:4. See HELL; IMMORTALITY; PARADISE; RIGHTEOUS, FUTURE STATE OF; SPIRIT; WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF.

**Key observation:** Nave's categorizes hades in two senses: (1) the unseen world, and (2) the realm/state of the dead. The second category includes passages describing the dead as unconscious (Psa 6:5; 88:10-12; 115:17; Ecc 9:4-6). Luke 16:23 appears under sense 1 (the unseen world), not as a doctrinal statement about the nature of the afterlife.

### ABRAHAM
- Also called Abram. Son of Terah (Gen 11:26,27). Marries Sarah (Gen 11:29). Divine call (Gen 12:1-3; Jos 24:3; Neh 9:7; Isa 51:2; Acts 7:2,3; Heb 11:8). Canaan given to (Gen 12:1,7; 15:7-21). God's covenant with (Gen 15; 17:1-22; Mic 7:20; Luk 1:73; Rom 4:13; 15:8; Heb 6:13,14; Gal 3:6-18,29; 4:22-31). Called "friend of God" (Isa 41:8; 2 Chr 20:7; Jas 2:23). Faith of (Gen 15:6; Rom 4:1-22; Gal 3:6-9; Heb 11:8-10,17-19; Jas 2:21-24). **In Paradise: Mat 8:11; Luk 13:28; 16:22-31.** Father of the faithful (Rom 4:16-18). In the genealogy of Jesus (Mat 1:1-2).

**Key observation:** Nave's lists Luke 16:22-31 under Abraham's entry as "In Paradise" alongside Mat 8:11 and Luk 13:28. The entry does NOT list "Abraham's bosom" as a doctrinal concept or a post-mortem location. The phrase "Abraham's bosom" (kolpos Abraam) as a location for the dead appears ONLY in Luke 16:22-23 in the entire Bible.

### HELL (Nave's full entry)
- In the AV this word occurs in OT Scriptures as translation of Hebrew "sheol" (the unseen state).
- In the RV of OT it appears only in: Isa 5:14; 14:9,15; 28:15,18; 57:9; Ezek 31:16,17; 32:21,27; Amos 9:2; Jonah 2:2; Hab 2:5
- Sheol is translated "grave" in AV in: Gen 37:35; 42:38; 44:29,31; 1 Sam 2:6; 1 Ki 2:6,9; Job 7:9; 14:13; 17:13; 21:13; 24:19; Psa 6:5; 30:3; 31:17; 49:14,15; 88:3; 89:48; 141:7; Pro 1:12; 30:16; Ecc 9:10; Song 8:6; Hos 13:14
- In the RV the Greek word "gehenna" is translated "hell" in: Mat 5:22,29,30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15,33; Mark 9:43,45,47; Luke 12:5; Jas 3:6
- The RV introduced "Hades" in: Mat 11:23; 16:18; Luke 10:15; 16:23; Acts 2:27,31; Rev 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14
- **THE FUTURE HOME OF THE WICKED:** Psa 9:17; Pro 5:5; 9:13,15-18; 15:24; 23:13,14; Isa 30:33; 33:14; Mat 3:12; 5:29,30; 7:13,14; 8:11,12; 10:28; 13:30,38-42,49,50; 16:18; 18:8,9,34,35; 22:13; 25:28-30,41,46; Mark 9:43-48; **Luke 3:17; 16:23-26,28**; Acts 1:25; 2 Thess 1:9; 2 Pet 2:4; Jude 1:6-23; Rev 2:11; 9:1,2; 11:7; 14:10,11; 19:20; 20:10,15; 21:8. See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF.

**Key observation:** Luke 16:23-26,28 is listed under "THE FUTURE HOME OF THE WICKED" alongside apocalyptic and parabolic passages. Nave's categorization does not distinguish between didactic and parabolic passages in this list.

### RICH, THE (Nave's entry)
- General scriptures: Neh 5:1-13; Job 21:7-15; 27:13-23; 31:24,25,28; Psa 49:16,17; 52:1-7; 73:3-22; Pro 14:20; 18:11,23; 28:11; Ecc 5:13,14,19,20; Jer 5:7-9,27-29; 9:23; 17:11; 22:13-19; Ezek 7:19; 28:5; Amo 6:1-6; Mic 6:12; Zep 1:18; **Mat 19:23,24; Mark 10:17-27; Luke 6:24,25; 12:15-21; 16:13,14,19-26; 18:22-26**; 1 Tim 6:17-19; Jas 1:9-11; 5:1-3.

**Key observation:** Luke 16:19-26 is listed under "THE RICH" as a general scripture about the dangers of wealth. This categorization treats the passage as a moral teaching about wealth, consistent with the parabolic reading where the rich man represents those who fail to heed Moses and the prophets.

### DEATH (Nave's excerpts relevant to this study)
- Called SLEEP: Deut 31:16; Job 7:21; 14:12; Jer 51:39; Dan 12:2; John 11:11; Acts 7:60; 13:36; 1 Cor 15:6,18,51; 1 Thess 4:14,15
- OF THE RIGHTEOUS: ... Luke 2:29; **16:22**; 23:43; John 11:11; Acts 7:59; ...
- OF THE WICKED: ... Luke 12:20; **16:22-28**; Acts 5:3-10; 1 Thess 5:3

**Key observation:** Nave's lists Luke 16:22 under DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS (Lazarus being carried to Abraham's bosom) and Luke 16:22-28 under DEATH OF THE WICKED (the rich man in hades). These listings treat both as illustrative of the broader topic of death, without making a distinction about genre.

### JESUS, PARABLES OF
Nave's entry for PARABLES references "See JESUS, PARABLES OF." The search for "parables of jesus" returned entries in MALFEASANCE IN OFFICE (referencing the steward of Luke 16:1-7) and INSTRUCTION. The PARABLES entry itself lists OT and NT parables together. Critically, the unjust steward parable (Luke 16:1-7) is explicitly recognized as a parable of Jesus, and it uses the same "a certain rich man" formula as Luke 16:19.
