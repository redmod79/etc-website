## Question

What is the literary genre of Luke 16:19-31 — is it a parable or a literal historical account of the afterlife? What does the passage say directly? What do the specific details mean in their first-century Jewish context? Does this passage prove eternal conscious torment in hades, or a conscious intermediate state between death and resurrection, or neither? How should IB006 (Luke 16 as literal hades description) be classified after a full dedicated investigation?

## Topics

### LAZARUS

**Nave's entry:**

1. Brother of Mary and Martha
   - Sickness and death of: John 11:1-14
   - Resurrection of: John 11:38-44; 12:17,18
   - Had dinner with Jesus: John 12:1,2,9
   - Plotted against by the chief priests: John 12:10,11

**Research note:** Nave's has only one entry for LAZARUS — the Lazarus of Bethany (brother of Mary and Martha). The Lazarus of Luke 16:19-31 has NO separate Nave's entry, suggesting Nave's does not treat him as a historical individual with a biographical record. This is significant: the only other "Lazarus" in Scripture is a real person Jesus raised from the dead. The name Lazarus (= Eleazar = "God helps") is itself meaningful in a parabolic context — the poor man whom God ultimately helps.

### PARADISE

**Nave's entry:**

- The place of glorified spirits: Luke 23:43; 2 Cor 12:4; Rev 2:7
- See EDEN

**Research note:** Nave's lists only 3 NT occurrences. The entry treats paradise as the place of glorified spirits — consistent with ECT/CIS reading. Note that "Abraham's bosom" does NOT appear in this entry; the equation of Abraham's bosom with paradise is NOT confirmed by Nave's — it is an interpretive inference.

### HADES

**Nave's entry (full):**

1. The unseen world, translated "hell" in A.V., but in the R.V. the word "Hades" is retained:
   - Matt 10:28; 11:23; 16:18; Luke 10:15; 16:23; Acts 2:27,31; Rev 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14
   - See HELL

2. The realm (state) of the dead:
   - 2 Sam 22:6; Job 26:5; Psa 6:5; 17:15; 30:9; 49:15; 86:13; 88:10-12; 115:17; 116:3; Prov 15:24; 21:16; 27:20; Ecc 9:4-6; Isa 5:14; Jon 2:2; Luke 23:42,43; John 8:22; 2 Cor 12:4
   - See HELL
   - See IMMORTALITY
   - See PARADISE
   - See RIGHTEOUS, FUTURE STATE OF
   - See SPIRIT
   - See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Research note:** Nave's treats HADES as having two aspects: (1) the Greek word translated "hell" in KJV, covering all NT occurrences including Luke 16:23; (2) the realm of the dead, with extensive OT cross-references. The sub-entry "realm of the dead" includes Ecc 9:4-6 — the same passage used by conditionalists to argue the dead are unconscious. This placement is significant: Nave's does not distinguish conscious vs unconscious hades; it treats the realm-of-the-dead concept as a unified category.

### TORMENTS

**Nave's entry:**

- Of the wicked: Luke 16:23-28; Rev 14:10,11
- See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Research note:** Nave's links the torments of Luke 16:23-28 directly with Rev 14:10,11. This is the standard ECT/traditionalist connection. However, the analysis agent should note:
- Luke 16:23-28 uses G931 basanos (noun) and G928 basanizo (verb) — both in hades, a TEMPORARY state
- Rev 14:10,11 uses G928 basanizo (verb) and G929 basanismos (noun) — in the context of God's wrath and eternal fire
- Rev 20:10 uses G928 basanizo for the devil in the lake of fire "for ever and ever"
- The torment in Luke 16 is pre-resurrection hades torment; the torment in Rev 14/20 is post-resurrection, final-judgment torment
- Whether these two are the same kind of experience, or whether Luke 16 is parabolic imagery, is the central question.

### PARABLES

**Nave's entry:**

General parables (OT and NT):
- Of the trees: Judg 9:8-15
- Of the lamb: 2 Sam 12:1-6
- Of the woman of Tekoa: 2 Sam 14:5-12
- Of the garment: 1 Kgs 11:30-32
- Of the prisoner of war: 1 Kgs 20:39-41
- Of the thistle and cedar: 2 Kgs 14:9
- Of a vine of Egypt: Psa 80:8-16
- Of the vineyard: Isa 5:1-7; 27:2,3
- Of the husbandman: Isa 28:23-29
- Of the skins filled with wine: Jer 13:12-14
- Of the vine: Ezek 15; 17:5-10; 19:10-14
- Of the two eagles: Ezek 17
- Of Aholah and Aholibah: Ezek 23
- The boiling pot: Ezek 24:3-5
- The gourd: Jon 4:10,11
- The sheet lowered down from the sky: Acts 10:10-16
- The two covenants: Gal 4:22-31
- The mercenary soldier: 2 Tim 2:3,4
- The farmer: 2 Tim 2:6
- Furnished house: 2 Tim 2:20,21
- The athlete: 2 Tim 2:5
- The mirror: Jas 1:23-25
- See JESUS, PARABLES OF
- See SYMBOLS, TYPES

**Research note:** Nave's does NOT include a "JESUS, PARABLES OF" topic under that name (the lookup returned no match). The PARABLES entry above is a general cross-testament list. Note that Nathan's parable of the lamb (2 Sam 12:1-6) is one of the most important genre parallels: a parable specifically designed to confront a powerful person with their sin — exactly the function of Luke 16 vis-a-vis the Pharisees (Luke 16:14-15).

### IMMORTALITY

**Nave's entry:**

General scriptures concerning:
- Gen 5:24; 2 Sam 12:23; 2 Kgs 2:11; Neh 9:5; Job 4:17-21; 14:13; Psa 16:10,11; 21:4; 22:26; 23:6; 31:5; 36:9; 37:18,27; 49:7-9,14,15; 73:26; 86:12; 102:4,25-28; 121:8; 133:3; 145:1,2; Prov 14:32; Ecc 3:21; 12:7; Isa 14:9; 25:8; 26:19; 38:18,19; Ezek 32:31; Dan 12:2,3; Matt 10:28; 16:26; 19:16,17; 25:46; Mark 10:30; 12:26,27; Luke 9:25; 10:25-28; 20:36-38; John 3:14-16,36; 5:39,40; 6:39,40,44,47,50,51,53,54,58; 10:28; 11:25,26; 14:19; 17:2,3; Acts 20:32; 23:8,9; 26:7,8,18; Rom 2:7; 6:22,23; 1 Cor 15:12-55; Gal 6:8; Col 1:5,6; 1 Thess 4:13-18; 5:10; 2 Thess 1:7-9; 2:16; 1 Tim 4:8; 6:12,19; 2 Tim 1:9,10; Titus 1:2; 3:7; Heb 9:15; 10:34; 11:5,10,13-16; 1 Pet 1:3-5; 1 John 2:17,25; 5:13; Jude 21; Rev 1:7; 3:4; 22:5

- See RESURRECTION
- See RIGHTEOUS, PROMISES TO
- See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Research note:** The IMMORTALITY entry includes both conditionalist-friendly verses (Ecc 3:21; 12:7; 1 Cor 15:12-55 which argues resurrection is the hope, not an intermediate state) and ECT-friendly verses (Luke 20:36-38; John 11:25,26; Luke 23:43 implicit). The entry does not resolve the question; it simply gathers all texts where human existence beyond death is discussed.

### HELL

**Nave's entry (relevant sections):**

Definitions/translations:
- In A.V., occurs in OT as translation of Hebrew "sheol" (unseen state)
- In R.V., "sheol" appears only in Isa 5:14; 14:9,15; 28:15,18; 57:9; Ezek 31:16,17; 32:21,27; Amos 9:2; Jon 2:2; Hab 2:5
- In R.V., "sheol" is translated "lowest pit" in Deut 32:22; Psa 86:13
- In R.V., "sheol" itself occurs in: 2 Sam 22:6; Job 11:8; 26:6; Psa 9:17; 16:10; 18:5; 116:3; 139:8; Prov 5:5; 7:27; 9:18; 15:11,24; 23:14; 27:20
- Sheol translated "grave" in A.V. in: Gen 37:35; 42:38; 44:29,31; 1 Sam 2:6; 1 Kgs 2:6,9; Job 7:9; 14:13; 17:13; 21:13; 24:19; Psa 6:5; 30:3; 31:17; 49:14,15; 88:3; 89:48; 141:7; Prov 1:12; 30:16; Ecc 9:10; Song 8:6; Hos 13:14
- In R.V., "gehenna" = hell: Matt 5:22,29,30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15,33; Mark 9:43,45,47; Luke 12:5; Jas 3:6
- In R.V., "Hades" retained: Matt 11:23; 16:18; Luke 10:15; 16:23; Acts 2:27,31; Rev 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14

**THE FUTURE HOME OF THE WICKED:**
Psa 9:17; Prov 5:5; 9:13,15-18; 15:24; 23:13,14; Isa 30:33; 33:14; Matt 3:12; 5:29,30; 7:13,14; 8:11,12; 10:28; 13:30,38-42,49,50; 16:18; 18:8,9,34,35; 22:13; 25:28-30,41,46; Mark 9:43-48; Luke 3:17; 16:23-26,28; Acts 1:25; 2 Thess 1:9; 2 Pet 2:4; Jude 6-23; Rev 2:11; 9:1,2; 11:7; 14:10,11; 19:20; 20:10,15; 21:8

- See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Research note:** Nave's "FUTURE HOME OF THE WICKED" sub-entry includes Luke 16:23-26,28 alongside Rev 20:10,15 and Matt 25:41,46. This conflates the intermediate state (hades) with the final state (lake of fire), which the analysis agent must examine carefully. The distinction between hades (Rev 20:13-14, temporary) and the lake of fire (permanent) is critical for evaluating whether Luke 16 is about eternal conscious torment or a temporary intermediate-state experience.

### SELF-INDULGENCE

**Nave's entry (relevant excerpt):**

Instances of:
- Solomon: Ecc 2:10
- The rich fool: Luke 12:16-20
- **The rich man who feasted every day: Luke 16:19**
- See GLUTTONY, IDLENESS, SLOTHFULNESS, SELF-DENIAL

**Research note:** Nave's cites Luke 16:19 under SELF-INDULGENCE alongside Luke 12:16-20 (the Rich Fool parable). This is significant: Nave's topically links the rich man of Luke 16 with the rich fool of Luke 12 — and Luke 12:16 is explicitly introduced as a parable ("he spake a parable unto them"). The genre parallel between the two "certain rich men" is noted in Nave's implicit classification.

## Related Topics Not Found in Nave's

- ABRAHAM'S BOSOM — no entry
- RICH MAN (as a Nave's topic) — no entry
- JESUS, PARABLES OF — no entry (lookup failed; general PARABLES entry found instead)

The absence of a specific "Abraham's Bosom" topic entry in Nave's is itself data: it is treated as a location within Luke 16, not as a standalone theological concept with independent biblical support.
