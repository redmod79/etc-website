## Primary Passage: Luke 16:19-31 (Rich Man and Lazarus)

> **Luke 16:19** There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
> **Luke 16:20** And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
> **Luke 16:21** And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
> **Luke 16:22** And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;

> **Luke 16:24** And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

> **Luke 16:26** And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.
> **Luke 16:27** Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
> **Luke 16:28** For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
> **Luke 16:29** Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

> **Luke 15:19** And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
> **Luke 15:20** And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
> **Luke 15:21** And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
> **Luke 15:22** But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet:
> **Luke 15:23** And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill [it]; and let us eat, and be merry:

### Luke 16:1-18 (Parable 4: Unjust Steward + Transitional Material)

> **Luke 16:1** And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
> **Luke 16:2** And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.
> **Luke 16:3** Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.
> **Luke 16:4** I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
> **Luke 16:5** So he called every one of his lord's debtors [unto him], and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
> **Luke 16:6** And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
> **Luke 16:7** Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
> **Luke 16:8** And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
> **Luke 16:9** And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.
> **Luke 16:10** He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

> **Luke 16:12** And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?
> **Luke 16:13** No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
> **Luke 16:14** And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.

## Luke 12:13-21 (Parable of the Rich Fool -- same "certain rich man" formula WITH parabole label)

> **Luke 12:13** And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
> **Luke 12:14** And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
> **Luke 12:15** And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
> **Luke 12:16** And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
> **Luke 12:17** And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
> **Luke 12:18** And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.
> **Luke 12:19** And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, [and] be merry.
> **Luke 12:20** But God said unto him, [Thou] fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?
> **Luke 12:21** So [is] he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.

**Note:** Luke 12:16 uses the phrase "a certain rich man" (anthropos tis plousios) and explicitly labels it as "a parable" (parabole). Luke 16:1 uses "a certain rich man" for the unjust steward. Luke 16:19 uses "a certain rich man" for the Rich Man and Lazarus. The formula is a Lukan parabolic marker.

## Same-Author Hades Passages (Luke-Acts)

> **Luke 10:15** And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.

> **Acts 2:24** Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
> **Acts 2:27** Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
> **Acts 2:29** Men [and] brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
> **Acts 2:31** He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.
> **Acts 2:34** For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

**Note:** Luke (the same author) records Peter's statement that David is "both dead and buried" and "is not ascended into the heavens" (Acts 2:29,34). This is a same-author, didactic statement about the state of the dead -- David has not gone to heaven despite being righteous.

## Other NT Hades Passages

## Resurrection as the Hope

> **1 Thessalonians 4:16** For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
> **1 Thessalonians 4:17** Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

---

## Personification and Mashal Parallels

> **Genesis 4:10** And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.

**Note:** Abel's blood "cries out" -- a personification. The dead Abel is not literally conscious and speaking. This parallels the literary device of giving voice to the dead in parabolic/figurative contexts.

> **Isaiah 14:4** That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!
> **Isaiah 14:9** Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet [thee] at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, [even] all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
> **Isaiah 14:10** All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?

**Note:** Isaiah 14 is explicitly labeled a mashal (proverb/taunt) in v.4. The dead kings "speak" in sheol -- a personification in prophetic poetry. The dead are depicted as seated on thrones and conversing. No one takes this literally.

> **Ezekiel 32:21** The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
> **Ezekiel 32:27** And they shall not lie with the mighty [that are] fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though [they were] the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

**Note:** Ezekiel 32 is a prophetic lamentation where dead warriors "speak" and lie with swords under their heads. The dead are depicted as lying down, slain -- yet they also "speak." This illustrates the literary convention of personification in figurative descriptions of sheol/hades.

## Torment Vocabulary Comparison Passages

### basanizo (G928) -- the standard NT torment verb (NOT used in Luke 16)
> **Revelation 14:10** The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
> **Revelation 14:11** And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
> **Revelation 20:10** And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

### basanos (G931) -- the noun used in Luke 16:23,28
> **Matthew 4:24** And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.

**Note:** The only occurrence of basanos outside Luke 16 is Matthew 4:24, where it refers to physical diseases/ailments -- not eschatological punishment.

### odunao (G3600) -- the verb used in Luke 16:24,25 (translated "tormented" but meaning "grieve/sorrow")
> **Luke 2:48** And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
> **Acts 20:38** Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.

**Note:** odunao is used for Mary's grief at losing the child Jesus (Luke 2:48) and the disciples' grief at Paul's departure (Acts 20:38). Neither involves eschatological punishment.

---

## kolpos (G2859) -- "bosom" Usage in the NT

> **Luke 6:38** Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
> **John 1:18** No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].
> **John 13:23** Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
> **Acts 27:39** And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.

**Note:** kolpos appears in 6 NT occurrences. The usage in John 1:18 ("in the bosom of the Father") and John 13:23 ("leaning on Jesus' bosom") describes intimate relationship -- not geography. Luke 6:38 uses it for the fold of a garment. Acts 27:39 uses it for a bay/inlet. Only in Luke 16:22-23 is kolpos used as a post-mortem location designation ("Abraham's bosom").

---

## Paradise (paradeisos, G3857) -- NOT used in Luke 16

> **Luke 23:43** And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
> **2 Corinthians 12:2** I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
> **2 Corinthians 12:3** And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
> **2 Corinthians 12:4** How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
> **Revelation 2:7** He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

**Note:** Luke 16:19-31 does NOT use paradeisos for the location of the righteous dead. It uses "Abraham's bosom" (kolpos Abraam) -- a phrase found nowhere else in Scripture. If the passage were teaching literal afterlife geography, the absence of the standard term "paradise" is notable.
