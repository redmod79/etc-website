## Question

What is the literary genre of Luke 16:19-31? Does it prove eternal conscious torment in hades, a conscious intermediate state, or is it a parable making a different theological point?

---

## 1. Luke 16:14-31 — Primary Passage (Full Context)

### Audience Setup: Covetous Pharisees (Luke 16:14-15)

> **Luke 16:14** — And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
> **Luke 16:15** — And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

**Note:** The immediate audience is the covetous Pharisees who are mocking Jesus. The passage that follows (16:19-31) is Jesus's direct response.

### Bridge Sayings (Luke 16:16-18)

> **Luke 16:16** — The law and the prophets [were] until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
> **Luke 16:17** — And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.
> **Luke 16:18** — Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from [her] husband committeth adultery.

**Note:** Three independent sayings about the law/prophets bracket the parable. The parable begins in v.19 and ends in v.31 with a direct return to the same theme ("Moses and the prophets"). The Law/Prophets frame is deliberate.

### The Dishonest Steward Parable (Context — Luke 16:1-13)

> **Luke 16:1** — And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.

**Note:** Luke 16:1 opens with the same formula: "There was a certain rich man" (Anthropos tis ēn plousios). This parallels Luke 16:19 exactly. The dishonest steward parable (16:1-13) is addressed to disciples; the rich man/Lazarus narrative (16:19-31) is addressed to the Pharisees (16:14). Both begin with "a certain rich man."

### The Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) — Full Passage

> **Luke 16:19** — There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
> **Luke 16:20** — And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
> **Luke 16:21** — And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
> **Luke 16:22** — And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
> **Luke 16:23** — And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
> **Luke 16:24** — And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
> **Luke 16:25** — But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
> **Luke 16:26** — And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.
> **Luke 16:27** — Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
> **Luke 16:28** — For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
> **Luke 16:29** — Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
> **Luke 16:30** — And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
> **Luke 16:31** — And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

**Key observations from the text:**
- v.19: Opening formula "There was a certain rich man" (= standard Lukan parabolic opening — see Genre Context section below)
- v.20: "a certain beggar named Lazarus" — the ONLY named figure in any of Jesus's parables
- v.22: Lazarus "carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom" — the poor man receives divine attention immediately after death
- v.23: "in hell [hades]" — the Greek is en tō Haidē, explicitly hades (dative case). NOT gehenna, NOT the lake of fire.
- v.23: "being in torments [basanois]" — present active participle ὑπάρχων ("being, existing") + dative plural of G931 basanos
- v.24: "tormented in this flame" — G3600 odunaomai, "I am in pain/anguish" — a different word from v.23
- v.25: The explicit reversal-of-fortunes statement: good things vs. evil things; now comforted vs. tormented
- v.26: "a great gulf fixed" — G5490 chasma (hapax legomenon) + ἐστήρικται (perfect passive indicative of stērizō — it has been fixed and remains fixed)
- v.28: "this place of torment" — torment used a third time (basanos, G931)
- v.29-31: The theological purpose stated explicitly: Moses and the prophets are sufficient; resurrection from the dead would not persuade those who reject Scripture
- v.31: "though one rose from the dead" — proleptic reference to Jesus's own resurrection, and also to the historical Lazarus of Bethany (John 11), who was raised and whom the chief priests then plotted to kill (John 12:10)

## 2. Genre Context — "A Certain Man/Rich Man" Parables in Luke

### Pattern Documentation

| Reference | Opening Formula | Word parabolē present? | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Luke 15:3 | "he spake this parable" | YES — v.3 explicitly | Lost sheep (parabole used for whole pericope Luke 15:3-32) |
| Luke 15:4 | "What man of you, having an hundred sheep..." | Implied by v.3 | Lost sheep — no "a certain man" |
| Luke 15:8 | "Either what woman having ten pieces of silver..." | Implied by v.3 | Lost coin — no "a certain man" |
| Luke 15:11 | "A certain man had two sons" | NO (but covered by v.3) | Prodigal Son — unlabeled but parabolic |
| Luke 16:1 | "There was a certain rich man" | NO | Dishonest Steward — to disciples |
| Luke 16:19 | "There was a certain rich man" | NO | Rich Man/Lazarus — to Pharisees |
| Luke 18:1-2 | "There was in a city a judge..." | YES — v.1 intro | Unjust Judge |
| Luke 18:9-10 | "Two men went up into the temple..." | YES — v.9 intro | Pharisee & Tax Collector |
| Luke 12:16 | "he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man..." | YES | Rich Fool — "a certain rich man" + explicit parabole |

### The verses themselves

> **Luke 15:3** — And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
> **Luke 15:11** — And he said, A certain man had two sons:
> **Luke 16:1** — There was a certain rich man, which had a steward...
> **Luke 16:19** — There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen...
> **Luke 12:16** — And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
> **Luke 18:1** — And he spake a parable unto them [to this end], that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
> **Luke 18:2** — Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:
> **Luke 10:30** — And Jesus answering said, A certain [man] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves...
> **Luke 14:16** — Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:

**Key finding on genre:** The same parabolic opening formula ("There was a certain [rich] man") is used throughout Luke 12, 15, 16, 18 without a consistent pattern of being labeled with parabolē. Luke 15:3 introduces parabolē and then proceeds to tell three consecutive parables (vv.4-7, 8-10, 11-32) — only the first is labeled. The Prodigal Son (15:11-32) is universally recognized as a parable despite having no parabolē label. Luke 16:19 follows the same pattern as Luke 16:1 (also no label), and both follow immediately after the labeled parabolē section.

## 3. The Naming Pattern — Lazarus as Unique Named Character

> **Luke 16:20** — And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus...

The name "Lazarus" (G2976, Lazaros) is the Greek form of the Hebrew Eleazar (אֶלְעָזָר) meaning "God helps" or "God has helped."

**The naming argument (ECT position):** This is the only parable of Jesus in which a character is given a name. All other parable figures are generic types (the prodigal son, the unjust judge, the good Samaritan's victim). The naming of Lazarus suggests he is a real person, making this a historical account rather than a parable.

**The naming counter-argument (Conditionalist/Parabolic position):** The name "Lazarus/Eleazar" = "God helps" is thematically appropriate for the poor man in a reversal-of-fortunes narrative — God ultimately helps him, while the self-sufficient rich man finds himself in need. The name functions symbolically. Furthermore:
- The rich man has NO name in the text (the name "Dives" = Latin for "rich" comes from the Vulgate, not the Greek)
- Abraham is named — but Abraham appears in numerous parables and in historical narratives alike
- Nathan's parable of the ewe lamb (2 Sam 12:1-6) introduces unnamed characters who are stand-ins for real people

**Also relevant — the other Lazarus:** John 11 introduces a historical Lazarus of Bethany who was raised from the dead by Jesus. Luke 16:31 ends with the statement: "neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead" — this reads as a proleptic allusion to the reaction of the chief priests after the historical Lazarus's resurrection (John 12:10-11).

## 4. Parallel Passages on Paradise

### Luke 23:40-43 — The Thief on the Cross

> **Luke 23:40** — But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
> **Luke 23:41** — And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
> **Luke 23:42** — And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
> **Luke 23:43** — And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

**Key observations:**
- "To day" (sēmeron, G4594) — same day as the crucifixion. Jesus died that same day. So "today" must include the period after Jesus's death but before his resurrection.
- "Paradise" (G3857) — the only use of paradeisos in Luke-Acts
- The ECT/CIS position: this promises the thief immediate conscious fellowship with Christ after death, in paradise
- The Conditionalist position: the comma placement is debated (Greek has no punctuation); some argue the construction means "I tell you today [with certainty]: you will be with me in paradise" — i.e., "today" modifies "I say" rather than "you will be." But see Greek parsing below: sēmeron follows the verb ἔσῃ (you will be), making the most natural reading "today...you will be."
- Note: Paradise here is NOT called "Abraham's bosom" — the equation requires an interpretive step

### 2 Corinthians 12:1-4 — Paul Caught Up to Paradise

> **2 Cor 12:1** — It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
> **2 Cor 12:2** — I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
> **2 Cor 12:3** — And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
> **2 Cor 12:4** — How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

**Key observations:**
- Paradise here is equated with "the third heaven" (v.2 = v.4)
- Paul is uncertain whether this was in the body or out of the body — suggesting the body/spirit distinction is not clear-cut
- This paradise is a place of revelation ("heard unspeakable words") — a heavenly realm, not a waiting room in hades
- The equation of 2 Cor 12 paradise with Luke 16:23 Abraham's bosom is doubly inferential: (a) paradise ≠ Abraham's bosom by any explicit text; (b) 2 Cor 12 paradise = the third heaven, which is not naturally equated with hades

### Revelation 2:7 — Tree of Life in Paradise

> **Rev 2:7** — He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

**Key observation:** The "paradise of God" here is a future eschatological reward promised to the overcomer. It contains the tree of life, which also appears in Rev 22:2,14 in the New Jerusalem. This is a post-resurrection, final-state paradise — not an intermediate-state paradise. Three uses of paradeisos: (a) Luke 23:43 — immediate post-death; (b) 2 Cor 12:4 — current heavenly realm; (c) Rev 2:7 — eschatological promise.

## 5. Parallel Passages on Conscious Interim State

### Philippians 1:20-24 — To Depart and Be With Christ

> **Phil 1:20** — According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.
> **Phil 1:21** — For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.
> **Phil 1:22** — But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
> **Phil 1:23** — For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
> **Phil 1:24** — Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.

**Key observations:**
- "To depart" (analuo, G360 — aorist active infinitive) — refers to death/departure from life
- "To be with Christ" (sun Christō einai — present active infinitive of eimi) — the state that follows departure
- The collocation "depart...and be with Christ" suggests that being with Christ follows immediately upon departing (= dying)
- This is the strongest NT text for a conscious intermediate state (classified E039 in the master evidence file)
- However, conditionalists note: Paul's perspective is on what happens at resurrection (Phil 3:20-21); the subjective experience of time in death may be instantaneous regardless of objective duration

### 2 Corinthians 5:1-8 — Absent from Body, Present with Lord

> **2 Cor 5:1** — For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
> **2 Cor 5:2** — For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
> **2 Cor 5:3** — If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
> **2 Cor 5:4** — For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
> **2 Cor 5:5** — Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
> **2 Cor 5:6** — Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
> **2 Cor 5:7** — (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
> **2 Cor 5:8** — We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

**Key observations:**
- v.8: "absent from the body" / "present with the Lord" — the binary (at home in body = absent from Lord; absent from body = present with Lord) is used as an argument for ECT/CIS
- v.4: Paul does NOT want to be unclothed (= disembodied?) but to be "clothed upon" — the hope is resurrection, not disembodied existence
- The tension: v.8 implies present-ness after death, but v.1-4 keeps the focus on the resurrection body
- Classified E038 in master evidence file

## 6. Parallel Passages on Death as Sleep

### John 11:1-14 — Lazarus of Bethany; Death Called Sleep

> **John 11:1** — Now a certain [man] was sick, [named] Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
> **John 11:2** — (It was [that] Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
> **John 11:3** — Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
> **John 11:4** — When Jesus heard [that], he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
> **John 11:5** — Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
> **John 11:6** — When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
> **John 11:11** — These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
> **John 11:12** — Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
> **John 11:13** — Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
> **John 11:14** — Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
> **John 11:21** — Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
> **John 11:22** — But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give [it] thee.
> **John 11:23** — Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
> **John 11:24** — Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
> **John 11:25** — Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:

**Key observations:**
- Jesus calls death "sleep" (koimaomai) — the disciples interpret this as literal sleep; Jesus clarifies he means death
- Jesus uses this metaphor for a historical Lazarus — the same name as the character in Luke 16
- The connection between the two "Lazaruses" is thematically deliberate: the historical Lazarus is raised (John 11:44) and then the chief priests plot to kill him again (John 12:10) — Jesus predicted this at Luke 16:31 ("neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead")
- Martha's confession: "I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day" — the standard Jewish hope (not an immediate conscious intermediate state)
- Conditionalist point: Jesus consistently uses sleep language for death; the disciples' misunderstanding ("if he sleep, he shall do well") shows they understood sleep to mean rest, not conscious torment

### 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 — Those Who Sleep in Jesus

> **1 Thess 4:13** — But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
> **1 Thess 4:14** — For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
> **1 Thess 4:15** — For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
> **1 Thess 4:16** — For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
> **1 Thess 4:17** — Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
> **1 Thess 4:18** — Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

**Key observations:**
- Paul's comfort for bereaved Christians is the resurrection, not the assurance that the dead are already consciously in heaven
- "Asleep" (koimaomai) used three times for the Christian dead (v.13,14,15)
- The event that brings the dead to the living presence of the Lord is the resurrection/parousia (v.16-17), not death itself
- If the dead were already consciously with Christ (as Phil 1:23 might imply), Paul's instruction to "comfort one another with these words" about the future resurrection would be less compelling — you could simply say "they are already with Christ"
- ECT response: Phil 1:23 and 1 Thess 4 describe different aspects of the same hope — immediate presence after death, and then bodily resurrection

## 7. Parallel Passages on Hades

### Acts 2:25-31 — David in Hades Until Resurrection

> **Acts 2:25** — For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
> **Acts 2:26** — Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
> **Acts 2:27** — Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [hades], neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
> **Acts 2:28** — Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
> **Acts 2:29** — Men [and] brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
> **Acts 2:30** — Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;
> **Acts 2:31** — He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell [hades], neither his flesh did see corruption.

**Key observations (classified E130/E131 in master evidence):**
- v.29: David "is both dead and buried" as of Pentecost (30-something years after his death) — he is NOT in conscious paradise
- v.27,31: The soul was NOT LEFT in hades — the soul WAS in hades until the resurrection
- Peter's point: Psalm 16:10 applies to Christ, not David, because David's soul DID remain in hades (he was not raised), while Christ's soul was NOT left in hades (he was raised)
- This establishes: souls of the dead ARE in hades between death and resurrection; hades is where souls wait for the resurrection
- Conditionalist implication: If David (a man "after God's own heart") is still dead and buried in hades at Pentecost, this contradicts the idea that the righteous are immediately conscious in paradise/Abraham's bosom
- ECT response: David was pre-cross; after Christ's ascension, the righteous go to paradise/Abraham's bosom, not to the same section of hades; Eph 4:8 may describe a transfer of the OT saints

### Revelation 20:11-15 — Hades Delivers Up the Dead

> **Rev 20:11** — And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
> **Rev 20:12** — And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
> **Rev 20:13** — And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell [hades] delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
> **Rev 20:14** — And death and hell [hades] were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
> **Rev 20:15** — And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

**Key observations (establishes N026 in master evidence):**
- v.13: Hades delivers up its dead — this implies people are IN hades before the resurrection/judgment
- v.14: Hades is CAST INTO the lake of fire — hades is abolished, destroyed, made irrelevant once the resurrection occurs
- The distinction: hades (temporary) ≠ lake of fire (final state). Luke 16 puts the rich man in hades, NOT in the lake of fire.
- Even if Luke 16 is literal, it describes the pre-resurrection intermediate-hades experience, not the final post-resurrection punishment
- After Rev 20:14, there is no more hades — only the lake of fire and the new creation

## 8. OT Background

### Matthew 22:29-32 — God of the Living (God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob)

> **Matt 22:29** — Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
> **Matt 22:30** — For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
> **Matt 22:31** — But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
> **Matt 22:32** — I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

**Key observations:**
- Jesus affirms Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are "living" in God's reckoning — the basis for resurrection
- This passage is about resurrection ("as touching the resurrection of the dead") — Jesus does not say Abraham is in conscious paradise; he says God reckons him as living in the context of the resurrection argument
- Luke 20:37-38 parallels: "he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham...For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him"
- The argument supports resurrection, not necessarily a conscious intermediate state

### Luke 13:28-29 — Abraham, Isaac, Jacob in the Kingdom

> **Luke 13:28** — There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you [yourselves] thrust out.
> **Luke 13:29** — And they shall come from the east, and [from] the west, and from the north, and [from] the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.

**Note:** Abraham, Isaac, Jacob in "the kingdom of God" — this is future/eschatological, not a current intermediate-state location.

### Matthew 8:11-12 — Abraham's Bosom Equivalent (Kingdom of Heaven)

> **Matt 8:11** — And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
> **Matt 8:12** — But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

**Note:** "Sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven" — this parallels the imagery of "Abraham's bosom" as the place of honor at the messianic banquet (being in Abraham's bosom = reclining next to Abraham at the feast). The image is eschatological/kingdom imagery.

### Ecclesiastes 9:4-6 — The Dead Know Nothing (E017/E018)

> **Ecc 9:4** — For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
> **Ecc 9:5** — For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
> **Ecc 9:6** — Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any [thing] that is done under the sun.

**Note:** This is the most direct biblical statement about the state of the dead. The passage affirms: (a) the dead know nothing; (b) their love/hatred/envy is perished; (c) they have no more portion in anything done under the sun. This is a plain-text E item (E017) that stands in tension with a literal reading of Luke 16.

### Psalm 146:3-4 — Thoughts Perish at Death (E013)

> **Psalm 146:3** — Put not your trust in princes, [nor] in the son of man, in whom [there is] no help.
> **Psalm 146:4** — His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.

**Note:** "In that very day his thoughts perish" — the cessation of mental activity at death is stated as occurring on the same day of death. E013 in master evidence.

### Job 14:12-13, 21 — Sleep Until the Heavens Are No More (E020/E021)

> **Job 14:12** — So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens [be] no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
> **Job 14:13** — O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
> **Job 14:21** — His sons come to honour, and he knoweth [it] not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth [it] not of them.

**Note:** v.12 = E020; v.21 = E021. The dead do not awake until resurrection. The dead man does not know what happens to his children — contradicting any notion of conscious awareness in the intermediate state.

### Hebrews 11:13-16 — Patriarchs Did Not Receive the Promises

> **Heb 11:13** — These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
> **Heb 11:14** — For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
> **Heb 11:15** — And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
> **Heb 11:16** — But now they desire a better [country], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.

**Note:** Abraham and the patriarchs died in faith "not having received the promises." If they were in conscious paradise immediately after death, in what sense had they "not received" the promises? The promises include the heavenly country and the city — which Heb 11:40 suggests they will receive WITH the NT believers at the resurrection ("that they without us should not be made perfect").

## 9. The "Before the Time" Torment Passage

### Matthew 8:28-29 — Demons: "Before the Time"

> **Matt 8:28** — And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
> **Matt 8:29** — And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?

**Key observation:** The demons recognize Jesus and say "art thou come to torment us before the time?" This implies:
- Permanent, complete torment for the wicked is a FUTURE eschatological event, not a present ongoing reality
- There is an appointed "time" (kairos) for final judgment/torment — it has not yet arrived during the earthly ministry of Jesus
- The Greek word "torment" here is basanizō (G928) — same root as basanos/basanismos in Luke 16 and Revelation
- Conditionalist argument: Even demons acknowledge that the full torment of their punishment is eschatological ("before the time") — this fits with the conditionalist reading that full/permanent judgment is post-resurrection, not present in the intermediate state
- ECT response: The demons' "before the time" refers to the lake of fire (final judgment), not to the absence of any torment in the intermediate period

## 10. Luke 20:35-38 — Resurrection and the God of the Living

> **Luke 20:35** — But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
> **Luke 20:36** — Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
> **Luke 20:37** — Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
> **Luke 20:38** — For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.

**Note:** "They which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead" — the deathless, angel-like state is tied to the resurrection, not to the intermediate state. "For all live unto him" — in God's perspective and purpose, all who are his are alive, even before the resurrection.

## 11. Matthew 12:40 — Heart of the Earth

> **Matt 12:40** — For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

**Note:** Jesus's soul was in hades (Acts 2:27,31) / the heart of the earth during the three days. This is the period of the intermediate state for Christ himself. If paradise/Abraham's bosom = the third heaven (2 Cor 12:2), then Christ was in the third heaven after his death — but Acts 2:27,31 says his soul was in hades (not left there, but IN hades). The resolution of where Christ was between death and resurrection informs the question of what hades is.
