# Word Studies

## Question

What do the key Greek words in Luke 16:19-31 mean, and what is their distribution in the NT? Do these word studies support the parabolic or literal interpretation of the passage?

## 1. G86 — ᾅδης (haidēs) — Hades

**Original Greek:** ᾅδης
**Transliteration:** háidēs
**Pronunciation:** hah-dace
**Part of Speech:** proper locative noun (n-pr)
**BLB Count:** 11 NT occurrences

**Definition (BLB/Strong's):** From alpha (alpha as negative particle) + idein (to see); properly, "unseen" — i.e., Hades. The name of the god of the underworld in Greek mythology, adopted in the LXX and NT to translate Hebrew sheol (the realm of the dead). Not identical to gehenna (the place of final punishment).

**Outline of Biblical Usage (BLB):** 2 Samuel 22:6; Job 10:21; 11:8; 38:17; Psalms 16:10; Isaiah 57:9; Amos 9:2; Matthew 11:23; 16:18; Luke 10:15; 16:23; Acts 2:24; 2:27; 2:31; 1 Corinthians 15:55; Revelation 1:18; 6:8; 20:13 [LXX references + NT]

**NT Occurrences (11):**
| Reference | KJV Translation | Context |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Matt 11:23 | "hell" | Capernaum to be thrust down to hades |
| Matt 16:18 | "hell" | "gates of hell shall not prevail against the church" |
| Luke 10:15 | "hell" | Capernaum exalted to heaven → cast down to hades |
| Luke 16:23 | "hell" | "in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments" |
| Acts 2:27 | "hell" | "thou wilt not leave my soul in hell" (Ps 16:10) |
| Acts 2:31 | "hell" | "his soul was not left in hell" (resurrection of Christ) |
| Rev 1:18 | "hell" | Christ has "the keys of hell and of death" |
| Rev 6:8 | "hell" | "Death and Hell followed with him" (fourth horseman) |
| Rev 20:13 | "hell" | "death and hell delivered up the dead" |
| Rev 20:14 | "hell" | "death and hell were cast into the lake of fire" |
| 1 Cor 15:55 | "O grave" | "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" (var. reading) |

**Translations:**
- "hell" × 7 (63.6%)
- "of hell" × 2 (18.2%)
- "O grave" × 1 (9.1%)
- "Hell" × 1 (9.1%)

**Key analysis:**
- Luke 16:23: The rich man is "en tō Haidē" (in hades, dative) — this is unambiguously the temporary pre-resurrection realm of the dead, not the lake of fire or gehenna
- Acts 2:27,31: Soul is IN hades; God does not LEAVE it there (Christ's case); but David's soul WAS left there (Acts 2:29 — David died and is buried as of Pentecost)
- Rev 20:13-14: Hades delivers up its dead at the resurrection, then hades itself is destroyed — cast into the lake of fire. Hades is TEMPORARY.
- The distinction hades ≠ gehenna (lake of fire) is structurally important: Luke 16 is set in hades, not in the final state
- 1 Cor 15:55 (variant): hades is paralleled with death as something to be conquered, not a permanent dwelling place

**Etymology note:** A + idein (not to see) = the unseen realm. The underworld was called "Hades" because it was invisible, the realm beyond mortal perception. In the NT it serves as the Greek equivalent of Hebrew sheol.

## 2. G931 — βάσανος (basanos) — Torment (Noun, Used in Luke 16)

**Original Greek:** βάσανος
**Transliteration:** básanos
**Pronunciation:** bas-an-os
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 3 NT occurrences

**Definition:** Perhaps from the same as basanis (a touchstone used to test metals); the process of testing by torturing; torture, torment, anguish.

**Outline of Biblical Usage (BLB):** Matthew 4:24; Luke 16:23; 16:28

**NT Occurrences (3):**
| Reference | KJV Translation | Context |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Matt 4:24 | "torments" | People "sick and...taken with divers diseases and torments" |
| Luke 16:23 | "torments" | Rich man "being in torments" (en basanois) |
| Luke 16:28 | "torment" | "this place of torment" (basanon) |

**Critical observation:** G931 basanos (noun) occurs ONLY 3 times in NT, and 2 of those 3 occurrences are in Luke 16 (vv.23,28). The third is Matthew 4:24 — physical sicknesses and torments. The word does NOT appear in Revelation. This is the OPPOSITE of G929 basanismos (see below).

**Usage note:** In Luke 16:23, the construction is "ὑπάρχων ἐν βασάνοις" — a present active participle ("being/existing") + dative plural — indicating an ongoing state of being in torments at that moment within the narrative.

---

## 3. G928 — βασανίζω (basanizō) — Torment (Verb)

**Original Greek:** βασανίζω
**Transliteration:** basanízō
**Pronunciation:** bas-an-id-zo
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**BLB Count:** 12 NT occurrences

**Definition:** From basanos; to torture, torment — includes meanings: pain, toil, torment, toss, vex.

**Outline of Biblical Usage (BLB):** Matthew 8:6; 8:29; 14:24; Mark 5:7; 6:48; Luke 8:28; 2 Peter 2:8; Revelation 9:5; 11:10; 12:2; 14:10; 20:10

**NT Occurrences (12) — Full Distribution:**
| Reference | KJV Translation | Context | Type |
|-----------|----------------|---------|------|
| Matt 8:6 | "tormented" | Servant sick, "grievously tormented" | Physical suffering |
| Matt 8:29 | "to torment" | Demons: "art thou come to torment us before the time?" | Supernatural/eschatological |
| Matt 14:24 | "tossed" | Ship "tossed with waves" | Nautical/physical |
| Mark 5:7 | "torment me not" | Demon to Jesus | Supernatural |
| Mark 6:48 | "toiling" | Disciples "toiling in rowing" | Physical labor |
| Luke 8:28 | "torment me not" | Demon to Jesus | Supernatural |
| 2 Pet 2:8 | "vexed" | Lot "vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked" | Mental anguish |
| Rev 9:5 | "they should be tormented" | Locusts tormenting men without seal | Eschatological judgment |
| Rev 11:10 | "tormented them" | Two witnesses tormented those on earth | Prophetic |
| Rev 12:2 | "pained" | Woman in labor travailing | Birth pangs |
| Rev 14:10 | "he shall be tormented" | Worshipers of beast tormented with fire | Eschatological judgment |
| Rev 20:10 | "shall be tormented...for ever and ever" | Devil in lake of fire | Final/eternal judgment |

**Translations (12 occurrences, 11 unique):**
"tormented" × 2; "to torment" / "torment" / "that thou torment" / "toiling" / "tossed" / "vexed" / "pained" / "they should be tormented" / "he shall be tormented" / "shall be tormented" × 1 each

**Critical observations:**
1. **Mark 6:48 uses basanizō for physical rowing** — the word does NOT exclusively mean supernatural torment; it can denote hard exertion or distress
2. **Matt 8:29: "before the time"** — demons acknowledge that permanent/complete basanizō torment is ESCHATOLOGICAL (at a future "time"), not presently occurring in the intermediate period
3. **Rev 20:10: "for ever and ever"** — basanizō appears with "for ever and ever" only in the lake of fire context, NOT in hades/intermediate-state contexts
4. **Luke 16 does NOT use basanizō directly** — Luke 16 uses G931 basanos (noun) in vv.23,28 and G3600 odunaomai (anguish/pain) in v.24. The verb basanizō is absent from Luke 16.

---

## 4. G929 — βασανισμός (basanismos) — Torment (Abstract Noun)

**Original Greek:** βασανισμός
**Transliteration:** basanismós
**Pronunciation:** bas-an-is-mos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 6 NT occurrences (but note: BLB count may differ from actual occurrences — see below)

**Definition:** From basanizō; torture, torment.

**Outline of Biblical Usage (BLB):** Revelation 9:5; 14:11; 18:7; 18:10; 18:15

**NT Occurrences (5 confirmed occurrences, ALL in Revelation):**
| Reference | KJV Translation | Context |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Rev 9:5 | "torment" | Torment of scorpion-locust sting |
| Rev 14:11 | "the torment" | "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" |
| Rev 18:7 | "torment" | Babylon's self-glorification / judgment |
| Rev 18:10 | "torment" | Kings of earth standing afar seeing Babylon's torment |
| Rev 18:15 | "torment" | Merchants weeping over Babylon's torment |

**CRITICAL OBSERVATION — G929 basanismos does NOT appear in Luke 16 at all.**

Luke 16 uses G931 basanos (2x: vv.23,28) and G3600 odunaomai (1x: v.24). The abstract noun basanismos — which always describes the torment of judgment in Revelation — is entirely absent from the passage. This distribution is exegetically significant:

- When Nave's connects Luke 16:23-28 with Rev 14:10,11 under "TORMENTS," it is linking two passages that use DIFFERENT Greek words
- Luke 16: basanos (noun) + odunaomai (pain verb)
- Rev 14:10-11: basanizō (verb) + basanismos (abstract noun) + aionios (eternal)
- The argument that Luke 16 describes the same experience as Rev 14:11 ("the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever") requires treating these differently-worded passages as equivalent, which is an interpretive inference, not a lexical identity

## 5. G3857 — παράδεισος (paradeisos) — Paradise

**Original Greek:** παράδεισος
**Transliteration:** parádeisos
**Pronunciation:** par-ad-i-sos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 3 NT occurrences

**Definition:** Of Oriental/Persian origin (compare Old Persian pairidaeza = "park, enclosed garden"); a park, an Eden, paradise. Applied to the Garden of Eden in the LXX, and in the NT to the place where the blessed dead are gathered and await the resurrection, or to the heavenly realm.

**Etymology:** The word is a loanword from Old Persian pairidaeza (pairi = "around" + daeza = "wall" = "walled enclosure/park"). Used in the LXX for the Garden of Eden (Gen 2:8; 3:1, etc.) and for any enclosed garden (Neh 2:8; Ecc 2:5; Song 4:13).

**NT Occurrences (3) — All three occurrences:**
| Reference | KJV Translation | Context |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Luke 23:43 | "paradise" | "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise" |
| 2 Cor 12:4 | "paradise" | "caught up into paradise" (= "third heaven" v.2) |
| Rev 2:7 | "paradise" | "the paradise of God" — tree of life for overcomer |

**Translations (3 occurrences, 1 unique translation):** "paradise" × 3 (100%)

**Note from BLB Outline (includes LXX):** The BLB outline of biblical usage lists OT references: Genesis 2:8; 3:1; 13:10; Nehemiah 2:8; Ecclesiastes 2:5; Song of Songs 4:13; Ezekiel 28:13; 31:8 — all referring to the Garden of Eden or to a garden/park.

**Key observations:**
1. **Three distinct NT contexts:**
   - Luke 23:43: Immediate post-death (on the day of crucifixion)
   - 2 Cor 12:4: A heavenly realm Paul was caught up to (14 years earlier, c. AD 44)
   - Rev 2:7: An eschatological reward for the overcomer, associated with the tree of life

2. **"Abraham's bosom" ≠ "paradise" by any explicit NT text.** The equation requires inference.

3. **2 Cor 12:4 places paradise in "the third heaven."** If paradise = the third heaven, and if Abraham's bosom = paradise, then Abraham's bosom is in the third heaven — but Luke 16 places the narrative in hades, not the third heaven. The geography of these concepts is not harmonized in the text itself.

4. **Rev 2:7 paradise has the "tree of life."** The tree of life appears in Rev 22:2,14 in the New Jerusalem. This is a post-resurrection, final-state symbol — not necessarily equivalent to an intermediate state paradise.

## 6. G3850 — παραβολή (parabolē) — Parable

**Original Greek:** παραβολή
**Transliteration:** parabolḗ
**Pronunciation:** par-ab-ol-ay
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**BLB Count:** 50 NT occurrences

**Definition:** From paraballō (para = beside + ballō = to throw); a placing beside, comparison, similitude; a parable, i.e., a fictitious narrative containing a moral; also a proverb or figure.

**Outline of Biblical Usage (BLB, NT occurrences only):**
Matthew 13:3,10,13,18,24,31,36,53; 15:15; 21:33,45; 22:1; 24:32; Mark 3:23; 4:2,10,11,13,30,33; 7:17; 12:1,12; 13:28; Luke 4:23; 5:36; 6:39; 8:4; 12:16; 12:41; 13:6; 14:7; 15:3; 18:1; 18:9; 19:11; 20:9; 20:19; 21:29; Hebrews 9:9; 11:19

**Distribution in Luke (key occurrences):**
| Reference | Context |
|-----------|---------|
| Luke 4:23 | "Ye will surely say unto me this proverb [parabolē]" |
| Luke 5:36 | "he spake also a parable [parabolē] unto them" |
| Luke 6:39 | "he spake a parable [parabolē] unto them" |
| Luke 8:4 | "he spake by a parable [parabolēs]" — introduces sower parable |
| Luke 12:16 | "he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man..." |
| Luke 12:41 | Peter asks "speakest thou this parable [parabolēn] unto us, or even to all?" |
| Luke 13:6 | "he spake also this parable [parabolēn]" — barren fig tree |
| Luke 14:7 | "he put forth a parable [parabolēn]" — at the dinner table |
| **Luke 15:3** | **"he spake this parable [parabolēn] unto them, saying..."** — introduces lost sheep pericope |
| Luke 18:1 | "he spake a parable [parabolēn] unto them" — unjust judge |
| Luke 18:9 | "he spake this parable [parabolēn] unto certain which trusted in themselves" — Pharisee and Tax Collector |
| Luke 19:11 | "he added and spake a parable [parabolēn]" — nobleman |
| Luke 20:9 | "he began to speak to the people this parable [parabolēn]" — wicked husbandmen |
| Luke 21:29 | "he spake to them a parable [parabolēn]" — fig tree |

**CRITICAL OBSERVATION — parabolē does NOT appear in Luke 16:19-31.**

However:
- Luke 15:3 introduces the parable (parabolēn) of the lost sheep, and then without a new parabolē introduction, Luke continues with the lost coin (15:8-10) and the Prodigal Son (15:11-32) — THREE parables under ONE parabolē introduction
- Similarly, Luke 16:1 ("There was a certain rich man") and Luke 16:19 ("There was a certain rich man") are both without explicit parabolē label
- Luke 12:16 DOES have an explicit parabolē label for a "certain rich man" parable (the Rich Fool)
- The absence of parabolē from Luke 16:19-31 does not prove the passage is not a parable — it proves only that Luke did not explicitly label it here. The same is true of the Prodigal Son (15:11-32).

**Genre pattern in Luke (comparable openings):**
- "A certain man" (Anthrōpos tis) — Good Samaritan (10:30), Prodigal Son (15:11), Lazarus (16:19)
- "A certain rich man" (anthrōpos tis plousios) — Rich Fool (12:16, WITH explicit parabolē); Dishonest Steward (16:1, WITHOUT parabolē); Rich Man/Lazarus (16:19, WITHOUT parabolē)

The OPENING FORMULA for all three "certain rich man" narratives in Luke 16 uses the same construction: "ἄνθρωπος δέ τις ἦν πλούσιος" (Luke 16:1 and 16:19). The Rich Fool (12:16) also uses the same "a certain rich man" motif and is EXPLICITLY labeled a parable.

## 7. G2859 — κόλπος (kolpos) — Bosom

**Original Greek:** κόλπος
**Transliteration:** kólpos
**Pronunciation:** kol-pos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 6 NT occurrences

**Definition:** Apparently a primary word; the bosom; by analogy, a bay (of water) — bosom, creek.

**Outline of Biblical Usage (BLB, including OT parallels):** Exodus 4:6; Proverbs 6:27; Isaiah 65:6; Jeremiah 32:18; 39:18; Luke 6:38; 16:22; 16:23; John 1:18; 13:23; Acts 27:39

**NT Occurrences (4 confirmed, from lookup = 4 unique):**
| Reference | KJV Translation | Context |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Luke 6:38 | "bosom" | "give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure...pressed down...shall men give into your bosom" |
| Luke 16:22 | "bosom" | "carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom" |
| Luke 16:23 | "bosom" | "Lazarus in his bosom" |
| John 1:18 | "bosom" | "the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father" |
| John 13:23 | "bosom" | "there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples" |
| Acts 27:39 | "creek" | "they discovered a certain creek with a shore" |

**Translations:**
- "bosom" × 3 (75%)
- "creek" × 1 (25%)

**Key observation — "bosom" as idiom for place of honor:**

The bosom/kolpos image in the NT is consistently about a position of close fellowship and intimacy:
- John 1:18: The Son is "in the bosom of the Father" — describing the closest possible relational intimacy between Father and Son
- John 13:23: John the beloved disciple is "leaning on Jesus' bosom" at the Last Supper — the honored position of the guest reclining next to the host
- Luke 16:22-23: Lazarus "in Abraham's bosom" — reclining in the place of honor next to Abraham (the host of the messianic banquet)

The image of "reclining in someone's bosom" = the position at the dining table next to the honored host. This is the same imagery as Matt 8:11 — "sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven." Abraham's bosom = the honored fellowship at the eschatological banquet table.

**This is a recognizable Jewish and Greco-Roman idiom** for the most honored position at a feast. The patron/host reclines; the honored guest reclines next to him with his back against the host's chest ("in his bosom"). It does not require a literal anatomical bosom.

## 8. G5490 — χάσμα (chasma) — Gulf

**Original Greek:** χάσμα
**Transliteration:** chásma
**Pronunciation:** khas-mah
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun (n)
**BLB Count:** 1 NT occurrence

**Definition:** From a form of an obsolete primary chaō (to "gape" or "yawn"); a chasm, gulf, abyss — a gaping opening.

**Outline of Biblical Usage (BLB):** Luke 16:26 only

**NT Occurrence (1 — hapax legomenon):**
| Reference | KJV Translation | Context |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Luke 16:26 | "gulf" | "between us and you there is a great gulf fixed" |

**Translations (1 occurrence, 1 unique):** "gulf" × 1 (100%)

**Hapax status confirmed:** G5490 chasma appears ONLY ONCE in the entire NT — in Luke 16:26. This makes it a hapax legomenon within the NT. There are no other NT occurrences to provide comparative context.

**Key grammatical detail from parsing:**
- "ἐστήρικται" (estēraktai) — perfect passive indicative 3rd person singular of stērizō (G4741 — to fix, establish firmly)
- The perfect passive indicates: this gulf was fixed in the past and remains fixed in the present (a completed state with present ongoing result)
- The gulf is permanent and immovable — no crossing from either direction is possible

**Jewish background (for research agent context only — not to be cited in output):**
The divided afterlife with a gulf separating the righteous and wicked is a feature of Jewish intertestamental literature (1 Enoch 22; Test. Abraham; Apocalypse of Zephaniah). Jesus may be using this familiar imagery as parabolic scaffolding, or he may be affirming a real geography of the afterlife. The hapax status means the word carries no other NT usage context.

## 9. G5590 — ψυχή (psychē) — Soul

**Original Greek:** ψυχή
**Transliteration:** psychḗ
**Pronunciation:** psoo-khay
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**BLB Count:** 105 NT occurrences (87 in the Strong's count from this database)

**Definition:** From psychō (to breathe); breath, i.e., (by implication) spirit, abstractly or concretely — the soul, heart, life, mind.

**Translations (87 occurrences in database):**
- "soul" × 32 (36.8%)
- "life" × 25 (28.7%)
- "souls" × 18 (20.7%)
- "lives" × 4 (4.6%)
- "the soul" / "Soul" / "their minds" / "the heart" / "heartily" / "of soul" / "of the soul" / "minds" × 1 each

**Key occurrences relevant to this study:**
| Reference | KJV Translation | Context |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Acts 2:27 | "soul" | "thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [hades]" — the soul of Christ |
| Acts 2:31 | "soul" | "his soul was not left in hell [hades]" — the soul of Christ |
| Rev 6:9 | "souls" | "I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain" |
| Rev 20:4 | "souls" | "I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus" |
| Luke 12:19 | "soul" | "Soul, thou hast much goods...eat, drink, [and] be merry" (Rich Fool) |
| Luke 12:20 | "soul" | "thy soul shall be required of thee" (Rich Fool — God's response) |
| Luke 1:46 | "soul" | "My soul doth magnify the Lord" (Mary's Magnificat) |
| Matt 10:28 | "soul" | "fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell [gehenna]" |
| 1 Cor 15:45 | "soul" | "first man Adam was made a living soul" — whole person |

**Key observations:**
- Acts 2:27,31: The psychē (soul) of Christ was IN hades and was NOT LEFT there — this is the key passage establishing that souls are in hades between death and resurrection
- Luke 12:19-20: The psychē of the rich fool departs at death ("thy soul shall be required of thee") — note that Luke 16 contains no reference to "soul" (psychē) in the narrative; the narrative mentions the person (rich man, Lazarus) without specifying whether they are souls, spirits, or some other form
- Matt 10:28: The soul can be destroyed in gehenna — gehenna (not hades) is where body and soul are destroyed
- Rev 6:9; 20:4: Souls visible in heaven — these are the souls of martyrs in a heavenly/pre-resurrection context

## 10. G4434 — πτωχός (ptōchos) — Beggar / Poor

**Original Greek:** πτωχός
**Transliteration:** ptōchós
**Pronunciation:** pto-khos
**Part of Speech:** adjective (adj) — used as noun
**BLB Count:** 34 NT occurrences (26 in this database)

**Definition:** From ptōssō (to crouch); akin to ptōma (fall); a beggar — one who crouches and cowers; the abjectly poor, beggarly.

**Translations (26 occurrences):**
- "poor" × 16 (61.5%)
- "to the poor" × 4 (15.4%)
- "the poor" × 2 (7.7%)
- "beggar" × 2 (7.7%)
- "unto the poor" × 1 (3.8%)
- "beggarly" × 1 (3.8%)

**Key Lukan occurrences:**
| Reference | KJV Translation | Context |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Luke 4:18 | "poor" | "to preach the gospel to the poor" — Jesus's mission |
| Luke 6:20 | "poor" | "Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God" |
| Luke 14:13 | "poor" | "when thou makest a feast, call the poor" |
| Luke 14:21 | "poor" | "bring in hither the poor, and the maimed..." |
| **Luke 16:20** | **"beggar"** | **"a certain beggar named Lazarus"** |
| **Luke 16:22** | **"the poor"** | **"the beggar [ptōchos] died"** |
| Luke 18:22 | "poor" | "distribute unto the poor" (rich young ruler) |
| Luke 19:8 | "poor" | "I give half of my goods to the poor" (Zacchaeus) |
| Luke 21:3 | "poor" | "this poor widow hath cast in more than they all" |

**Key observations:**
- Lazarus is identified as ptōchos — the abjectly poor, a beggar who crouches at the gate
- Luke consistently uses ptōchos in the context of the reversal-of-fortunes Lukan theme: the poor are blessed (6:20), the poor receive the gospel (4:18), the poor are to be invited to feasts (14:13,21)
- The ptōchos Lazarus at the gate of the rich man is the paradigmatic Lukan figure of the one whom God vindicates in the eschatological reversal
- Luke 6:24-25 provides the direct parallel: "Woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep."
- The reversal formula of Luke 16:25 ("thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented") echoes Luke 6:24-25 precisely
