## Question

Is Luke 16:19-31 a literal historical account of the intermediate state — proving that the wicked suffer conscious torment in hades and the righteous enjoy conscious comfort in Abraham's bosom immediately after death — or is it a parable using familiar Jewish imagery to make a point about the sufficiency of Moses and the Prophets? How should IB006 (Luke 16 as literal hades description) be classified after this dedicated investigation?

---

## Summary Answer

Luke 16:19-31 is most reasonably interpreted as a parable — a literary genre employing familiar Jewish intertestamental imagery to make a specific theological point about the adequacy of existing revelation. This conclusion reaches **Moderate** (not Strong) confidence. The passage is categorized accordingly as **IB006: Moderate — weight toward parabolic/literary genre interpretation.**

The core reasons for this resolution:
1. The same "certain rich man" opening formula appears in Luke 12:16 *with an explicit parabolē label* — a direct intra-Lukan SIS connection.
2. Luke's demonstrated practice of covering consecutive parables with a single parabolē label (Luke 15:3 covers three parables; Luke 16 continues the discourse) explains the absence of a label in 16:19.
3. The passage states its own theological purpose in vv.29-31: the sufficiency of Moses and the Prophets — not afterlife description.
4. The plain state-of-the-dead passages (E017, E013, E020, E130, E131 — multiple independent authors) outweigh the single Contextually Clear passage depicting conscious activity in the parabolic narrative.
5. IB001 (conscious intermediate state) has already been resolved Moderate AGAINST in etc5-04; Luke 16 as a literal exception to that resolution requires additional Plain support that is not available.

The Moderate (not Strong) classification reflects the genuine anomaly: Lazarus is named — the only named human character in any parable of Jesus — and this unusual feature cannot be dismissed.

## Full Analysis

See `03-analysis.md` for the full verse-by-verse analysis, Greek word studies, genre analysis, and SIS application. The following is a summary of the key findings organized around the investigative questions.

### Genre Determination

The absence of the word parabolē (G3850) in Luke 16:19-31 does not establish that the passage is non-parabolic. This is demonstrated by two convergent observations:

**Observation 1 (E224):** Luke 15:3 introduces three consecutive parables with a single parabolē label. The prodigal son (15:11-32) — universally accepted as a parable — has no parabolē label of its own. Luke does not re-label each unit in a parabolic discourse.

**Observation 2 (E225):** The opening formula of Luke 16:19 ("There was a certain rich man") is *explicitly* labeled a parabolē in Luke 12:16. Luke knows and uses the parabolē label when introducing this formula. Its absence in 16:19 is explained by the discourse-level label pattern, not by a change in genre.

Combined, these two observations make the absence of parabolē in Luke 16:19-31 uninformative as a genre marker. The Lukan narrative context is parabolic.

### The Naming of Lazarus

Lazarus (G2976 = Hebrew Eleazar = "God helps") is the only named human character in any parable of Jesus. This is the strongest argument for the literal reading. However:

- The meaning of the name ("God helps") is thematically integral to the parable's reversal-of-fortunes structure: the poor man whom the world ignores is the man whom God helps.
- The rich man is unnamed in the Greek text (the name "Dives" is from the Vulgate's translation, not from the Greek original). An unnamed protagonist in an ostensibly literal account is anomalous.
- Unusual features within a parable do not convert its genre. The Prodigal Son contains extraordinary detail — emotional interiority, extended dialogue, sequential narrative — without being a historical account.

The naming of Lazarus is genuine evidence that prevents Strong resolution. It does not by itself override the convergent genre indicators.

### The Theological Purpose

Luke 16:29-31 (E223) is the passage's self-stated purpose. The narrative exists to make a point about Moses and the Prophets as sufficient revelation. The afterlife imagery (hades, Abraham's bosom, the great gulf) is the vehicle — the story frame within which the theological argument is delivered. This is standard parabolic technique.

Cross-testament parallel data confirms this: the highest-scoring NT parallels for Luke 16:31 are all Moses-and-the-Prophets texts (Luke 16:29 at 0.507, Acts 3:22 at 0.458, Luke 20:37 at 0.437, Luke 24:44 at 0.400). The passage's textual affiliations are with the sufficiency-of-Scripture argument, not with afterlife geography passages.

### What Luke 16 Cannot Prove Even on a Literal Reading

Even granting a literal reading, a critical constraint applies: the location described is hades (G86), not the lake of fire. N026 (established in etc5-04) establishes that hades is the temporary pre-resurrection holding state (Rev 20:13-14: hades delivers up the dead, then is itself cast into the lake of fire). The rich man's five brothers are still alive (v.28), placing this explicitly in the pre-resurrection period.

A literal Luke 16 cannot establish:
- That the *final* fate of the wicked is conscious torment (hades is temporary)
- That this is the eternal state (the passage describes pre-judgment hades)

A literal Luke 16 can only establish (at most):
- That there is conscious experience in the pre-resurrection intermediate state
- That this experience differs between the righteous and wicked

But IB001 (the conscious intermediate state question) has already been resolved Moderate AGAINST in etc5-04, with full consideration of E123. Using Luke 16 to prove IB001 requires overriding a prior Moderate resolution with a single Contextually Clear passage from a parabolic context.

### The Torment Vocabulary

The torment terms in Luke 16 are G931 (basanos, vv.23,28) and G3600 (odunaomai, v.24). The abstract torment noun G929 (basanismos) — which is used in all five Revelation eschatological judgment passages — does not appear in Luke 16 at all. If this passage were intended to describe the eschatological fate of the wicked in language consistent with Revelation's torment vocabulary, the absence of basanismos is notable.

### New E Items (This Study)

| ID | Explicit Statement | Reference | Classification | First Appeared |
|----|--------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| E219 | The opening formula of Luke 16:19 ("Ἄνθρωπος δέ τις ἦν πλούσιος" — "There was a certain rich man") is identical in pattern to Luke 16:1 (Dishonest Steward, unlabeled) and echoes Luke 12:16 (Rich Fool, explicitly labeled parabolē by the same author). | Luke 16:19; Luke 16:1; Luke 12:16 | Neutral | etc5-09 |
| E220 | Lazarus (G2976) is the only named human character in any parable of Jesus in the gospel tradition; the rich man has no proper name in the Greek text. | Luke 16:20 | Neutral | etc5-09 |
| E221 | "The beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried." Both deaths stated as simple aorist events; Lazarus's transport contrasted with the rich man's ordinary burial. | Luke 16:22 | Neutral | etc5-09 |
| E222 | "Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed" — G5490 chasma (hapax legomenon in the NT, occurring only here) + ἐστήρικται (perfect passive indicative of stērizō = permanently established, completed state). | Luke 16:26 | Neutral | etc5-09 |
| E223 | "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them... If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead." The stated theological purpose and conclusion of the narrative: the sufficiency of existing revelation. | Luke 16:29, 31 | Neutral | etc5-09 |
| E224 | Luke 15:3 introduces three consecutive parables under a single parabolē label ("he spake this parable unto them"). The three units that follow (lost sheep, lost coin, prodigal son) are none of them individually re-labeled with parabolē. The prodigal son (15:11-32) is universally accepted as a parable despite having no label. | Luke 15:3-32 | Neutral | etc5-09 |
| E225 | Luke 12:16 explicitly labels the "certain rich man" narrative as a parable: "And he spake a parable (parabolēn, G3850) unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully." The same opening formula as Luke 16:19 receives an explicit parabolē label in Luke 12:16. | Luke 12:16 | Neutral | etc5-09 |
| E226 | The demons say to Jesus: "Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?" (πρὸ καιροῦ βασανίσαι ἡμᾶς, basanizō G928). The demons explicitly acknowledge that their permanent torment is a future eschatological event ("before the time"), not a present ongoing reality in the intermediate state. | Matthew 8:29 | Neutral | etc5-09 |
| E227 | Luke 16 uses G931 (basanos, vv.23,28) and G3600 (odunaomai, v.24) for torment language. G929 (basanismos), the abstract torment noun found in all 5 Revelation eschatological judgment passages (Rev 9:5; 14:11; 18:7; 18:10; 18:15), does not appear in Luke 16. | Luke 16:23, 24, 28; Rev 9:5; 14:11; 18:7; 18:10; 18:15 | Neutral | etc5-09 |
| E228 | "These all died in faith, not having received the promises" (Heb 11:13). "That they without us should not be made perfect" (Heb 11:40). The patriarchs — including Abraham — are described as not yet having received the promised fulfillment as of their death, and as requiring future completion together with NT believers. | Hebrews 11:13, 40 | Conditionalist | etc5-09 |
| E229 | Luke 16:14-15 identifies the immediate audience of the narrative: "The Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him." The rich man/Lazarus narrative is Jesus's direct response to the covetous, self-justifying Pharisees. | Luke 16:14-15 | Neutral | etc5-09 |
| E230 | The word paradeisos (G3857) does not appear in Luke 16. The only description of the righteous dead's location in Luke 16 is "Abraham's bosom" (kolpos, G2859). No biblical text explicitly equates "Abraham's bosom" with "paradise." | Luke 16:19-31 (absence of G3857); Luke 23:43; 2 Cor 12:4; Rev 2:7 (G3857 occurrences) | Neutral | etc5-09 |

### New N Item (This Study)

| ID | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Classification | First Appeared |
|----|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| N038 | Even on a literal reading, the location described in Luke 16:23 is hades (G86, the temporary pre-resurrection holding state), not gehenna or the lake of fire. The passage therefore cannot, even if taken as literal, directly establish the *final* post-judgment fate of the wicked as eternal conscious torment. | N026 (hades = temporary pre-resurrection state); E134 (Rev 20:13: hades delivers up the dead at judgment); E110 (Rev 20:14: hades cast into the lake of fire); E222 (Luke 16:28 places the narrative in the pre-resurrection period: five brothers still alive) | N026 establishes that hades is temporary and pre-judgment. The rich man's brothers are still alive (v.28), confirming the pre-resurrection setting. Rev 20:13-14 sequences the end of hades at the judgment. Together these yield the conclusion that Luke 16, even literally interpreted, describes a pre-judgment intermediate state in hades, not the final post-judgment state. | Neutral | etc5-09 |

## IB006 Full SIS Resolution (5-Step)

### IB006 Claim
Luke 16:19-31 is a literal historical account of the intermediate state, providing factual information about conscious existence in Hades/Abraham's bosom between death and resurrection.

### Step 1: Tension

**FOR literal (E/N support):**
- E123 (Luke 16:23-25): Rich man in hades, conscious, in torments, sees Abraham, dialogue — Contextually Clear
- E220 (Luke 16:20): Lazarus is the only named human character in any parable — Neutral
- E222 (Luke 16:26): Great gulf permanently fixed — Neutral

**AGAINST literal / FOR parabolic (E/N support):**
- E225 (Luke 12:16): Same "certain rich man" formula explicitly labeled parabolē — Plain
- E224 (Luke 15:3): Single parabolē label covers three consecutive unlabeled parables — Plain
- E223 (Luke 16:29-31): Passage's own stated theological purpose = sufficiency of Moses and Prophets — Plain
- E219 (Luke 16:19): Opening formula matches labeled and unlabeled parabolic patterns — Neutral
- E229 (Luke 16:14-15): Pharisee audience identified — Neutral
- E131 (Acts 2:31): Same author's understanding of hades as pre-resurrection holding state — Plain
- E017 (Ecc 9:5): Dead know not any thing — Plain
- E013 (Psa 146:4): Thoughts perish that very day — Plain
- E020 (Job 14:12): Shall not awake until heavens no more — Plain
- E130 (Acts 2:29): David dead and buried as of Pentecost — Plain
- N026: Hades = temporary — Contextually Clear
- N023: Dead lack consciousness, multiple independent authors — Conditionalist necessary

### Step 2: Clarity Assessment

| Item | Clarity Rating | Basis |
|------|----------------|-------|
| E123 (conscious in hades) | Contextually Clear | Text is explicit but genre context (parabolic narrative, stated theological purpose) introduces interpretive ambiguity |
| E225 (Luke 12:16 = same formula, labeled parabole) | Plain | Direct observable textual fact: label present in Luke 12:16, formula identical to Luke 16:19 |
| E224 (Luke 15:3 covers three unlabeled parables) | Plain | Observable grammatical-literary fact universally acknowledged |
| E223 (stated purpose = Moses/Prophets) | Plain | Text's own v.29,31 are direct statements of the narrative's purpose |
| E017, E013, E020 | Plain | Unqualified direct statements, multiple independent authors |
| E130, E131 | Plain | Direct explicit statements in the same Lukan corpus |
| N026 | Contextually Clear | Established from three independent passages in etc5-04 |

The weight of Plain items is consistently AGAINST a literal reading. The primary FOR-literal item (E123) is Contextually Clear — genuine evidential weight, but not Plain.

### Step 3: Count and Weight

**FOR literal:** 1 Contextually Clear (E123) + 2 supporting Neutral observations (E220, E222)

**AGAINST literal:** 2 Plain genre items (E224, E225) + 1 Plain self-interpretation (E223) + 4 Plain state-of-the-dead items (E013, E017, E020, E130, E131) + 1 Contextually Clear N item (N026) + N023 (necessary implication from multiple authors)

The Plain items on the AGAINST side outnumber and outweigh the Contextually Clear item on the FOR side. Where Plain and Contextually Clear items conflict, Plain governs.

### Step 4: Apply SIS Cross-References

**SIS Connection #1 — E225 → E123 (#4a, intra-Lukan):**
The "certain rich man" formula appears in Luke 12:16 WITH an explicit parabolē label (same author, same Gospel, same formula). This governs the reading of Luke 16:19 which uses the same formula without a label. A verified same-author, same-vocabulary SIS connection: the labeled instance clarifies the unlabeled instance.

**SIS Connection #2 — E224 → E123 (#4a, intra-Lukan):**
Luke's demonstrated practice at 15:3-32 shows that a single parabolē label covers multiple consecutive units, none of which are individually re-labeled. The absence of parabolē in Luke 16:19 is consistent with this pattern. The genre is established by discourse-level context, not by verse-level labeling.

**SIS Connection #3 — E131 → E123 (#4a, intra-Lukan, same author):**
Luke wrote both Acts 2:31 (Christ's soul in hades until resurrection) and Luke 16:23 (rich man in hades). Luke's framework for hades is consistent: it is the temporary pre-resurrection holding state. E131 governs the interpretation of the hades reference in E123: this is not a description of the final state but of the pre-resurrection intermediate state.

**SIS Connection #4 — E223 → E123 (self-interpretation, #4a):**
The passage itself states its own purpose in Luke 16:29-31. The narrative is not presented as revelatory afterlife geography — it is presented as a parabolic argument for the sufficiency of Scripture. This is the clearest possible SIS connection: the text interprets itself.

**SIS Connection #5 — IB001 context:**
IB001 (conscious intermediate state) has been resolved Moderate AGAINST in etc5-04 with full consideration of E123 as one of the FOR items. A literal reading of Luke 16 as proof of a conscious intermediate state now constitutes an exception claim requiring additional Plain support. The available additional support from this study (E220 — naming, E222 — fixed gulf) is Neutral, not Plain, and does not constitute sufficient additional support to override or substantially modify IB001's resolution.

### Step 5: Resolution

**IB006: RESOLVED — Moderate — weight toward parabolic/literary genre interpretation (not literal hades description)**

The FOR-parabolic side has the following convergent Plain and Contextually Clear evidence:
- Two Plain genre items establishing Lukan parabolic practice for this exact formula and discourse type (E224, E225)
- One Plain self-interpretation item (E223) — the passage's own stated purpose
- Five Plain state-of-the-dead items from 3+ independent authors (E013, E017, E020, E130, E131)
- Four confirmed #4a SIS connections (same author, verified textual)

The FOR-literal side has:
- One Contextually Clear item (E123) with genuine evidential weight
- One genuinely anomalous feature (E220 — Lazarus named) that prevents Strong resolution

**NOT STRONG** because: Lazarus is named (genuinely unique in the parable tradition), and the detailed dialogue and imagery are more elaborate than most parables. The naming of Lazarus is a real anomaly that introduces irreducible uncertainty. An investigator cannot simply declare this anomaly irrelevant.

**NOT UNRESOLVED** because: The convergent weight of Plain evidence (E224, E225, E223, E013, E017, E020, E130, E131) with four confirmed #4a SIS connections from the same author provides sufficient grounds for Moderate resolution. The prior Unresolved status was appropriate when this specific evidence set had not been fully assembled and analyzed together.

---

## Updated I-B Table Entry for IB006

The IB006 entry in the master evidence file is updated as follows:

**Previous resolution:** Unresolved — the genre question cannot be resolved by the text itself; the parable's stated purpose (v.31) is the sufficiency of Scripture, not post-death description.

**New resolution:** **Moderate — weight toward parabolic/literary genre interpretation (not literal hades description)**. FOR literal: E123 (Contextually Clear — conscious activity described in text, but parabolic genre context prevents Plain status); E220 (Lazarus named — genuine anomaly, Neutral). FOR parabolic: E224 (Plain — Lukan parabolic practice established for discourse-level unlabeled units); E225 (Plain — same "certain rich man" formula explicitly labeled parabolē in Luk 12:16, same author); E223 (Plain — passage's own stated purpose = sufficiency of Moses/Prophets, vv.29-31); E013, E017, E020, E130, E131 (all Plain — state-of-the-dead passages from multiple independent authors); N026 (Contextually Clear — hades = temporary pre-resurrection state); N023 (Conditionalist necessary — dead lack consciousness, multiple independent authors). SIS #4a connections: (1) Luk 12:16 labeled instance governs Luk 16:19 same-formula unlabeled instance; (2) Luk 15:3 discourse-level label practice explains unlabeled parabolic units; (3) Acts 2:31 (same author) establishes hades as pre-resurrection state governing Luk 16:23; (4) Luk 16:29-31 self-interpretation: stated purpose governs the narrative's genre function. NOT STRONG: naming of Lazarus (E220) is genuinely unusual in the parable tradition and cannot be dismissed; introduces irreducible Moderate uncertainty. N038 (NEW): even on literal reading, the passage describes pre-resurrection hades, not the final post-judgment state — cannot prove ECT as final fate.

## Conclusion

This study reaches the following determinations:

**Primary finding:** Luke 16:19-31 is most appropriately classified as a parable — a literary narrative using familiar Jewish intertestamental afterlife imagery (divided regions of the dead, a separating gulf, the figure of Abraham) to make a specific theological argument: that Moses and the Prophets are sufficient revelation, and that those who reject them will not be persuaded even by a resurrection from the dead. The passage's genre is consistent with Luke's parabolic discourse pattern. The same "certain rich man" opening formula is explicitly labeled a parable in Luke 12:16.

**IB006 resolution:** Changed from Unresolved to **Moderate — weight toward parabolic/literary genre interpretation (not literal hades description).** This is not Strong: the naming of Lazarus is a genuine anomaly that prevents certainty.

**What Luke 16 cannot establish even on a literal reading:** Because the passage explicitly locates the rich man in hades (G86) — the temporary pre-resurrection holding state established by N026 and confirmed by Revelation 20:13-14 — and because the rich man's five living brothers place the narrative firmly in the pre-resurrection period, Luke 16 cannot directly establish *eternal conscious torment* as the *final post-judgment state* of the wicked. This would require conflating hades with the lake of fire, which Revelation 20:14 explicitly distinguishes as separate (hades is cast into the lake of fire; they are not the same). N038 records this necessary implication.

**Remaining unresolved I-B item:** After this study, IB004 (substance dualism / dichotomy) remains the only Unresolved I-B item in the series.

**Methodological note:** The investigator-not-advocate principle has been maintained throughout. The resolution of IB006 was determined by the weight of E/N evidence and the SIS protocol, not by the investigator's theological position. The ECT evidence (E123 — conscious activity described in the text) was acknowledged and assigned its appropriate Contextually Clear rating. The conclusion follows from the evidence: Plain items govern Contextually Clear items, and multiple independent Plain witnesses from the AGAINST-literal side outweigh the single Contextually Clear item from the FOR-literal side.
