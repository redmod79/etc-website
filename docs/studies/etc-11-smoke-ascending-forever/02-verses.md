## 1. Revelation 14:6-13 — Primary Passage (Three Angels + Warning + Smoke)

### Full Text

> Revelation 14:6 — And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
>
> Revelation 14:7 — Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
>
> Revelation 14:8 — And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

### Notes on Rev 14:6-13

**Structural context:** The three-angel sequence (vv.6-11) functions as a warning set before harvest judgment (vv.14-20). The first angel announces the everlasting gospel and coming judgment (v.6-7). The second announces Babylon's fall (v.8). The third announces consequences for beast-worship (vv.9-11).

**Subjects of vv.9-11:** "any man" (v.9) — indefinite, general; "who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name" (v.11) — human worshippers of the beast. These are HUMAN BEINGS, contrasted with the supernatural trio in Rev 20:10 (devil, beast, false prophet).

**The torment (v.10):** "tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb" — ἐνώπιον (enōpion = "before/in the presence of") appears twice. The torment is located spatially/temporally at a judgment scene in the divine presence.

**The smoke (v.11):** "And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever (eis aionas aionon)" — kapnos + basanismos + anabainei (Present Active Indicative) + eis aionas aionon. The present tense of anabainei ("ascends/goes up") is the verb form.

**The contrast (vv.12-13):** Immediately after the warning about the beast-worshippers having "no rest (anapausin) day nor night" (v.11), v.13 announces that those who die in the Lord "may rest (anapausōntai) from their labours." The same root word (G373 anapaūō) is used. This contrast, within three verses, between "no rest" for the wicked and "rest" for the righteous dead is striking.

## 2. Revelation 19:1-5 — Babylon's Smoke "For Ever and Ever"

> Revelation 19:1 — And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
>
> Revelation 19:2 — For true and righteous [are] his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
>
> Revelation 19:3 — And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
>
> Revelation 19:4 — And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
>
> Revelation 19:5 — And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.

### Notes on Rev 19:1-5

**Context:** Rev 18 has just described the fall of Babylon — she was "utterly burned with fire" (18:8), "in one hour" (18:10,17,19), made desolate (18:19), thrown down like a millstone and "found no more at all" (18:21). Rev 19:1-5 is the heavenly response — the great multitude praising God for judging Babylon.

**Rev 19:3 structure (Greek):** "καὶ ὁ καπνὸς αὐτῆς ἀναβαίνει εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων" — literally: "And the smoke of her goes up into the ages of the ages."
- αὐτῆς = Gen Sg Feminine = Babylon's smoke (not a person's smoke)
- ἀναβαίνει = Present Active Indicative, 3rd Sg — same form as Rev 14:11's ἀναβαίνει
- εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων = full formula with articles, identical to Rev 20:10

**The key argument from this verse:** Rev 19:3 uses the IDENTICAL linguistic formula ("smoke... goes up... eis aionas aionon") that Rev 14:11 uses for beast-worshippers. Yet Rev 19:3 refers to Babylon — a city described in Rev 18 as already destroyed, burned in "one hour," "found no more at all." If the smoke-for-ever formula requires ongoing conscious torment, then Babylon must be perpetually and consciously suffering — but Babylon is a city/system, not a person, and the broader context describes it as utterly destroyed, not perpetually burning. Therefore, the formula "smoke rose up for ever and ever" expresses permanent destruction, not necessarily ongoing burning.

**Babylon's basanismos in Rev 18:** Note G929 (basanismos = torment) appears in Rev 18:7 ("so much torment and sorrow"), 18:10 ("the hour of her judgment/torment"), 18:15 ("the fear of her torment") — all describing Babylon's judgment. The same torment-noun used for beast-worshippers in Rev 14:11 is used three times for Babylon's judgment in Rev 18, consistently in contexts of completed destruction.

## 3. Revelation 20:7-15 — Final Judgment Including Devil/Beast/False Prophet

> Revelation 20:7 — And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
>
> Revelation 20:8 — And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea.
>
> Revelation 20:9 — And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
>
> Revelation 20:10 — And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
>
> Revelation 20:11 — And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
>
> Revelation 20:12 — And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
>
> Revelation 20:13 — And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
>
> Revelation 20:14 — And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
>
> Revelation 20:15 — And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

### Notes on Rev 20:7-15

**Subjects of v.10:** "the devil," "the beast," and "the false prophet" — a supernatural/quasi-supernatural trio, distinct from the "any man" of Rev 14:9-11. This distinction matters: if there is a difference between the fate of the devil and the fate of human beings, the passages should not be conflated without analysis.

**Rev 20:9:** "fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them" — the nations gathered by Gog/Magog are "devoured" (Greek: katephagen, aorist). This is the human armies. Immediately after, v.10 addresses the devil/beast/false prophet going into the lake of fire.

**Rev 20:10 grammar:** "shall be tormented (βασανισθήσονται — Future Passive Indicative 3P) day and night for ever and ever (εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων)" — the future tense here is prospective from the point of the vision.

**Rev 20:14:** "death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." — Death and Hades are "cast into" the lake, meaning they are ended/destroyed. The lake of fire = the second death. If death itself can be cast into the second death (i.e., destroyed), this raises questions about what "for ever and ever" means for entities cast into it.

**Rev 20:15:** Human beings who were not in the book of life are "cast into the lake of fire" — but no "for ever and ever" or "day and night" is specified for them; those descriptions appear in v.10 for the devil/beast/false prophet. The analysis agent will need to address the differences between v.10 and v.15.

## 4. OT Source Texts

### Isaiah 34:1-17 (Edom's Destruction — Primary OT Source)

> Isaiah 34:1 — Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.
>
> Isaiah 34:2 — For the indignation of the LORD [is] upon all nations, and [his] fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
>
> Isaiah 34:3 — Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
>
> Isaiah 34:4 — And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling [fig] from the fig tree.
>
> Isaiah 34:5 — For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
>
> Isaiah 34:6 — The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, [and] with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.
>
> Isaiah 34:7 — And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
>
> Isaiah 34:8 — For [it is] the day of the LORD'S vengeance, [and] the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.
>
> Isaiah 34:9 — And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
>
> Isaiah 34:10 — It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
>
> Isaiah 34:11 — But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
>
> Isaiah 34:12 — They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none [shall be] there, and all her princes shall be nothing.
>
> Isaiah 34:13 — And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, [and] a court for owls.
>
> Isaiah 34:14 — The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
>
> Isaiah 34:15 — There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.
>
> Isaiah 34:16 — Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.
>
> Isaiah 34:17 — And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

**Notes on Isaiah 34:**

**Verse 8:** "The day of the LORD'S vengeance" (yom naqam) — judgment framing. Nave's ETERNAL PUNISHMENT sub-entry begins with "ISA 34:8-10."

**Verse 9:** H1614 (gophrith = brimstone) appears here — "dust thereof into brimstone." This is the Sodom-fire-and-brimstone pattern applied to Edom. The LXX maps H1614 → G2303 (theion, brimstone) — the same word used in Rev 14:10 and 20:10.

**Verse 10 (CRITICAL):**
- "It shall not be quenched night nor day" — the fire described as unquenchable (same language as Isa 66:24 and the Mark 9 passages about Gehenna)
- "the smoke thereof shall go up for ever (leolam)" — H6227 (ashan = smoke) + H5769 (olam = for ever)
- "from generation to generation it shall lie waste" — the result is desolation across generations
- "none shall pass through it for ever and ever (leolam vaed)" — H5769 twice

**Verses 11-17:** After the smoke-ascending-forever statement, the passage describes:
- Birds of prey possessing the land (v.11)
- Confusion and emptiness (v.11)
- No nobles in the kingdom (v.12)
- Thorns, nettles, brambles in palaces; habitation of dragons (v.13)
- Screech owl "at rest" there (v.14) — ironically, the wild creatures find rest in the desolate land
- Vultures nesting (v.15)
- These animals shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation (v.17)

**THE CRITICAL PATTERN:** Isa 34:10 announces "smoke ascending for ever" → vv.11-17 describe the ongoing state as a desolate, empty land with animals. There are NO HUMANS THERE. No ongoing burning. No ongoing conscious suffering. The "smoke ascending for ever" describes the RESULT (permanent, irreversible destruction) not an ongoing process. The animals now inhabit the desolate land permanently.

**Confirmed by cross-testament tool:** Isa 34:10 is the #1 OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (hybrid score 0.401) and for Rev 19:3 (score 0.330) — with unique theological phrase match "continual, forever / eternal_fire, forever." The tool confirms this is the key OT source text for both Revelation passages.

### Genesis 19:20-29 (Sodom: Fire, Brimstone, Smoke as Furnace)

> Genesis 19:23 — The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
>
> Genesis 19:24 — Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
>
> Genesis 19:25 — And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
>
> Genesis 19:26 — But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
>
> Genesis 19:27 — And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
>
> Genesis 19:28 — And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
>
> Genesis 19:29 — And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

**Notes:** Gen 19:28 is the foundational "smoke" scene in the Bible for this study. H6227 (ashan = smoke) appears here: "the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace." The smoke was VISIBLE AFTERWARD — Abraham sees it the next morning. This is smoke after destruction, not smoke as evidence of ongoing burning. The destruction was past; the smoke was a residual sign of it.

The cross-testament parallel tool shows Gen 19:28 connecting to Jude 1:7 (score 0.313) and to Rev 14:11 (score 0.290) among NT parallels — confirming the typological chain.

### Psalm 37:18-22 (Wicked Consume Into Smoke)

> Psalm 37:18 — The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.
>
> Psalm 37:20 — But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD [shall be] as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.

**Notes:** "Into smoke shall they consume away" — H6227 (ashan). The smoke here is the END PRODUCT of consumption, not an ongoing state. The fat of lambs is consumed BY FIRE and becomes smoke — the smoke is what remains after consumption, not an alternative to it. The wicked "shall perish... they shall consume... into smoke they consume away." This is total consumption/destruction imagery. Smoke = the evidence of being consumed, not of ongoing existence in smoke.

---

### Psalm 68:1-3 (Smoke Driven Away)

> Psalm 68:1 — Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.
>
> Psalm 68:2 — As smoke is driven away, [so] drive [them] away: as wax melteth before the fire, [so] let the wicked perish at the presence of God.

**Notes:** Smoke as image of dispersal and disappearing. "As smoke is driven away" paralleled with "as wax melteth before the fire." Both images describe total disappearance. "Let the wicked perish" is the prayer. This OT use of smoke reinforces the meaning of smoke as a sign of transience and destruction, not permanence.

---

### Isaiah 66:22-24 (Carcases, Worm, Unquenching Fire)

> Isaiah 66:22 — For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
>
> Isaiah 66:23 — And it shall come to pass, [that] from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
>
> Isaiah 66:24 — And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.

**Notes:** This is the OT source text for Jesus's Gehenna sayings (Mark 9:43-48). Several observations:
- Subject = "the carcases (pegerim = dead bodies) of the men" — not living, conscious persons but dead bodies
- "Their worm shall not die" — worms feeding on corpses; the decomposition is ongoing
- "Their fire be quenched" — the fire is unquenchable but the subjects are corpses, not conscious sufferers
- The scene is part of the new earth/new heavens context — the righteous go forth to look upon the slain
- "An abhorring unto all flesh" — perpetual revulsion; the memory/witness of their destruction persists

This text establishes that "unquenching fire" in the prophetic tradition applies to bodies/corpses, not necessarily to conscious ongoing experience.

## 5. Babylon Parallels (Isa 13; Jer 50-51)

### Isaiah 13:17-22 (Babylon Like Sodom; Never Inhabited)

> Isaiah 13:17 — Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and [as for] gold, they shall not delight in it.
>
> Isaiah 13:19 — And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
>
> Isaiah 13:20 — It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
>
> Isaiah 13:21 — But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.
>
> Isaiah 13:22 — And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in [their] pleasant palaces: and her time [is] near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

**Notes:** The explicit equation of Babylon's destruction with Sodom's (v.19). The result: "never inhabited... never dwelt in from generation to generation" (H5769 leolam). Wild animals possess the desolate site (vv.21-22). This is the EXACT SAME POST-DESTRUCTION PICTURE as Isa 34:11-17 for Edom: uninhabited, wild animals dwelling there. The destruction is permanent desolation, not ongoing burning.

### Isaiah 14:20-23 (Babylon Swept with Besom of Destruction)

> Isaiah 14:22 — For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.
>
> Isaiah 14:23 — I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.

**Notes:** "Besom of destruction" — totally swept clean. The "bittern" (a bird) possessing the site mirrors both Isa 34:11 (birds possessing Edom) and Isa 13:21 (birds possessing Babylon). This consistent bird-in-desolation motif across all three judgment sites (Sodom aftermath, Edom, Babylon) reinforces the permanent-desolation pattern.

### Jeremiah 50:37-41 and 51:37-58 (Babylon Perpetual Desolation; Like Sodom)

> Jeremiah 50:39 — Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell [there], and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
>
> Jeremiah 50:40 — As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour [cities] thereof, saith the LORD; [so] shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
>
> Jeremiah 51:37 — And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.
>
> Jeremiah 51:39 — In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.
>
> Jeremiah 51:57 — And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise [men], her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name [is] the LORD of hosts.
>
> Jeremiah 51:58 — Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.

**Notes:**
- Jer 50:39-40: Babylon = like Sodom. No more inhabited "for ever" (H5769 leolam). Wild animals dwell there.
- Jer 51:39,57: "sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake" — this is the Hebrew description of Babylon's rulers' fate: permanent death-sleep, not ongoing conscious torment.
- Jer 51:58: "high gates shall be burned with fire" — the gates are burned. The fire is a destruction event, not an ongoing state.

The Babylonian "perpetual sleep and not wake" language (Jer 51:39,57) alongside the Sodom comparison provides strong OT evidence that the finality of judgment language (for ever, eternal, never more) describes permanent, irreversible destruction rather than ongoing conscious experience.

## 6. "No Rest Day and Night" Comparison Passages

### Revelation 4:7-10 (Living Creatures "Rest Not Day and Night")

> Revelation 4:8 — And the four beasts had each of them six wings about [him]; and [they were] full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.

**Notes:** The living creatures have "no rest (anapausin ouk ekhousin) day and night" — they are ceaselessly worshipping God. Their "no rest" is expressed as continuous activity: "saying, Holy, holy, holy." This is the POSITIVE use of G372 (anapausis). The Greek structure is grammatically identical to Rev 14:11: same noun, same negative particle, same verb form.

**The lexical point:** G372 anapausis means "intermission; recreation; rest." Its absence means unceasing activity. In Rev 4:8, the living creatures' "no rest" = they are ALWAYS worshipping. In Rev 14:11, the beast-worshippers' "no rest" = they have no cessation, no reprieve during their judgment.

### Revelation 7:14-16 (The Redeemed Serve Day and Night)

> Revelation 7:15 — Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.

**Notes:** "Serve him day and night" — the redeemed before the throne are in continuous, unceasing service. This is the positive ongoing activity that mirrors the structure of Rev 14:11. "Day and night" in Revelation can describe:
- Positive ongoing activity: Rev 4:8 (worship); 7:15 (service)
- Accusatory ongoing activity: Rev 12:10 (devil accusing "day and night")
- Judgment without respite: Rev 14:11; 20:10

### Revelation 12:10 (Devil Accuses Day and Night)

> Revelation 12:10 — And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.

**Notes:** The devil "accused... before our God day and night" — past tense (this is the devil's prior activity, now ended). His day-and-night activity is ceased when he is cast down. This verse shows that "day and night" activity can STOP — the devil's day-and-night accusation ends at the mid-tribulation casting down. This is potentially relevant to interpreting "no rest day nor night" in Rev 14:11.

### Revelation 20:10 (Tormented Day and Night — Devil, Beast, False Prophet)

See Section 3 above.

---

## 7. "For Ever and Ever" (eis aionas aionon) — Other Uses in Revelation

The phrase "for ever and ever" (eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn or variant) appears 13-14 times in Revelation. The subject breakdown:

**God or Christ as subject (9 uses):**
- Rev 1:6: "to him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever" — praise to Christ
- Rev 1:18: "I am alive for evermore" — Christ's eternal life
- Rev 4:9: "him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever"
- Rev 4:10: "worship him that liveth for ever and ever"
- Rev 5:13: "unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever"
- Rev 5:14: "worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever"
- Rev 7:12: "Blessing, and glory... be unto our God for ever and ever"
- Rev 10:6: "sware by him that liveth for ever and ever"
- Rev 15:7: "God, who liveth for ever and ever"

**Christ's kingdom/reign (1 use):**
- Rev 11:15: "he shall reign for ever and ever"

**Saints' reign (1 use):**
- Rev 22:5: "they shall reign for ever and ever"

**Judgment/torment (3 uses):**
- Rev 14:11: smoke of beast-worshippers' torment "for ever and ever"
- Rev 19:3: Babylon's smoke "for ever and ever"
- Rev 20:10: devil/beast/false prophet tormented "for ever and ever"

**The pattern:** The same phrase used for God's eternal life, Christ's eternal reign, and the saints' eternal reign is also used for the eternal character of the judgment/smoke. This cuts both ways:
- For ECT: the phrase must mean genuinely endless duration, since it describes God's eternal existence
- For conditionalism/permanent-desolation: the phrase describes the ETERNAL CHARACTER of the result (permanent, irreversible, never undone), not necessarily endless ongoing activity — just as Babylon's "smoke for ever" describes permanent destruction, not perpetual burning

## 8. Fire and Brimstone Passages

### Genesis 19:24 (Fire and Brimstone on Sodom)

> Genesis 19:24 — Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;

**Notes:** First biblical use of fire-and-brimstone in judgment. H1614 (gophrith) + esh (fire). The foundational event. LXX: H1614 → G2303 (theion = brimstone) — the same word used in Rev 9:17; 14:10; 19:20; 20:10; 21:8.

### Ezekiel 38:20-22 (Fire and Brimstone on Gog)

> Ezekiel 38:22 — And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that [are] with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

**Notes:** The Gog judgment draws on Sodom imagery: "fire and brimstone" rained down from heaven. This is the same judgment pattern applied eschatologically. The parallel with Sodom is explicit: the same fire-from-heaven pattern.

### Revelation 9:17-18 (Horses with Fire, Smoke, Brimstone)

> Revelation 9:17 — ...out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
>
> Revelation 9:18 — By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.

**Notes:** Fire, smoke, and brimstone together as instruments of divine judgment — the Sodom pattern. Here they KILL men ("the third part of men killed"). The fire, smoke, and brimstone are death-dealing, not torment-sustaining; they slay.

### Revelation 19:20 (Beast and False Prophet Cast Into Lake)

> Revelation 19:20 — And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.

**Notes:** "Cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." This precedes Rev 20:10 where they are "tormented day and night for ever." Rev 19:20 is the casting event; Rev 20:10 is the result. The cross-testament tool confirms Rev 19:20 is the #1 NT parallel for Rev 20:10 (hybrid 0.641).

### Revelation 21:6-8 (Lake of Fire = Second Death)

> Revelation 21:8 — But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

**Notes:** The lake of fire and brimstone is explicitly equated with "the second death." The "second death" language (also Rev 20:14) frames the lake of fire as death, not as perpetual life in torment. The analysis of this phrase will be critical for understanding what the lake of fire does to those cast into it.

## 9. Jude 1:7 + 2 Peter 2:6 (Sodom = Eternal Fire = Ashes)

### Jude 1:5-8

> Jude 1:5 — I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
>
> Jude 1:6 — And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
>
> Jude 1:7 — Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
>
> Jude 1:8 — Likewise also these [filthy] dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

**Notes on Jude 1:7:**
- "πρόκεινται" (prokeinai) = Present M/P Indicative, 3rd Pl — "they are set forth" / "they lie before" — present tense: Sodom/Gomorrah ARE (presently, in Jude's time) a specimen/example
- "δεῖγμα" (deigma) = "example, specimen, display" — they are a currently visible exemplar
- "πυρὸς αἰωνίου δίκην ὑπέχουσαι" = "undergoing punishment of eternal fire" — Present Active Participle "undergoing" / "suffering" — they ARE (present tense) undergoing the punishment of eternal fire

**The interpretive question for Jude 1:7:** In what sense are Sodom/Gomorrah "presently undergoing" eternal fire? The fire was long extinguished by Jude's time. The answer (established as N029 in this series from etc5-08): the "eternal fire" is the fire that brought about their permanent, irrevocable destruction. They are presently "undergoing" it in the sense that they remain in their destroyed state — the punishment is permanent (eternal in its effects). They are an ongoing example precisely because they have never been restored. The "eternal fire" is called eternal because its effects are permanent and irreversible, not because the physical fire continues burning.

### 2 Peter 2:4-8

> 2 Peter 2:5 — And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person], a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
>
> 2 Peter 2:6 — And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
>
> 2 Peter 2:7 — And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:

**Notes on 2 Pet 2:6:**
- "turning... into ashes" (G5077 tephrōsas) — the cities were reduced to ash. Ashes are the end-product of complete combustion. Ashes are not burning.
- "an ensample (hupodeigma) unto those that after should live ungodly" — same Greek word (from deigma) as Jude 1:7 — both passages use the example/specimen concept
- The cross-testament tool confirms 2 Pet 2:6 is the #1 NT parallel for Jude 1:7 (score 0.471)

**The Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6 synthesis (N029):** Sodom is "suffering the vengeance of eternal fire" (Jude) because it "turned into ashes" (2 Peter). The eternal fire produced ashes — permanent, complete destruction. "Eternal fire" = fire whose results are eternal (permanent, irreversible), not fire that burns forever. This is the established N029 in this series.

**Relevance to Rev 14:11:** If the OT source text (Isa 34:10, Edom) shows smoke ascending for ever followed by desolation with animals, and if the Sodom precedent (the foundational smoke/fire type) results in ashes (not ongoing burning), then the "smoke ascending for ever" formula follows the OT pattern of expressing permanent, irreversible destruction — not ongoing conscious torment.

## 10. Additional Cross-Reference Passages

### Revelation 15:7-8 (Temple Filled with Smoke)

> Revelation 15:7 — And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
>
> Revelation 15:8 — And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.

**Notes:** Rev 15:8 uses G2586 (kapnos = smoke) for the temple filled with smoke from God's glory. This is divine theophanic smoke (cf. Isa 6:4). The smoke here is associated with God's presence and wrath (the seven plagues). It precedes the pouring out of judgment.

### Nahum 1:4-10 (Mountains Quake; Earth Burned; Utter End)

> Nahum 1:5 — The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
>
> Nahum 1:8 — But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
>
> Nahum 1:9 — What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.

**Notes:** "An utter end" — Nah 1:8-9 describes God making a complete, thorough end of the wicked. "Affliction shall not rise up the second time" — once judged, the judgment is final. This supports the permanent-desolation interpretation: the destruction is complete and not repeated.

### Matthew 25:40-46 (Everlasting Fire; Everlasting Punishment)

> Matthew 25:41 — Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
>
> Matthew 25:46 — And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

**Notes:**
- "Everlasting fire (pyr aiōnion) prepared for the devil and his angels" — G166 aiōnios modifying G4442 pyr. The fire was prepared for supernatural beings (devil and angels). Humans go "into" it.
- "Everlasting punishment (kolasin aiōnion)" vs. "life eternal (zōēn aiōnion)" — same adjective (G166) applied to both punishment and life. If aiōnion means endless duration for life, it means endless duration for punishment; if it means qualitative eternal-age character for one, it means the same for the other.
- This is significant ECT evidence: the parallel structure (everlasting punishment / life eternal) suggests the duration of both is the same.

### 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9 (Everlasting Destruction)

> 2 Thessalonians 1:9 — Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;

**Notes:**
- "Everlasting destruction (olethron aiōnion)" — G3639 + G166. "Destruction from the presence of the Lord"
- The punishment is described as "destruction" not "torment" — a destruction that is eternal in character
- "From the presence of the Lord" — banishment from God's presence
- The cross-testament NT parallels tool shows 2TH 1:8 connecting to Rev 14:11 (score 0.331, keyword "burn")
