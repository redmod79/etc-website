## Primary Verses

### A. The Core Revelation Passages

#### Revelation 14:6-13 (Three Angels' Messages -- Full Context)

> **14:6** And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
>
> **14:7** Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
>
> **14:8** And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
>
> **14:9** And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
>
> **14:10** The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
>
> **14:11** And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
>
> **14:12** Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
>
> **14:13** And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed [are] the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.

**Notes:** The "rest" in v.13 (anapauomai, cognate of anapausis in v.11) directly contrasts with the "no rest" of v.11. Beast-worshippers have "no rest"; the faithful dead DO "rest."

---

#### Revelation 19:1-6 (Babylon's Smoke -- Hallelujah Chorus)

> **19:1** And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
>
> **19:2** For true and righteous [are] his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
>
> **19:3** And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
>
> **19:4** And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
>
> **19:5** And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.
>
> **19:6** And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

**Notes:** Rev 19:3 uses the identical "smoke... for ever and ever" formula as Rev 14:11 but for symbolic Babylon -- already described as utterly destroyed (Rev 18:8,17,21). Same formula, same book, same author.

---

#### Revelation 20:9-10 (Fire Devoured / Devil, Beast, False Prophet)

> **20:9** And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
>
> **20:10** And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

**Notes:** V.9 uses "devoured" (katephagen) for the human enemies. V.10 uses "tormented day and night for ever and ever" for the devil, beast, and false prophet -- the latter two are symbolic entities (E205). Different subjects receive different descriptions.

---

### B. "Day and Night" / "No Rest" Comparisons Within Revelation

#### Revelation 4:8 (Living Creatures -- "Rest Not Day and Night")

> **4:8** And the four beasts had each of them six wings about [him]; and [they were] full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.

**Notes:** Same word anapausis (G372) as Rev 14:11. The living creatures "rest not day and night" in ceaseless divine praise. Same word, same book, same author. The phrase characterizes the nature of the activity during its duration, not necessarily an eternal conscious state.

#### Revelation 7:15 (The Redeemed -- "Day and Night")

> **7:15** Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.

**Notes:** The redeemed "serve him day and night" -- parallel construction to the judgment "day and night" phrases.

---

### C. "For Ever and Ever" (eis aionas aionon) in Revelation

#### Revelation 11:15

> **11:15** And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become [the kingdoms] of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.

#### Revelation 22:5

> **22:5** And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

**Notes:** Same "eis aionas aionon" formula used for Christ's reign (11:15) and the redeemed's reign (22:5). The same formula is used in judgment contexts (14:11; 19:3; 20:10). The formula appears ~19 times in Revelation for God/Christ/the redeemed and 3 times in judgment contexts.

---

### D. Babylon's Torment and Smoke (Rev 17-18)

#### Revelation 17:16

> **17:16** And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

#### Revelation 18:7-10,15,18,21

> **18:7** How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
>
> **18:8** Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong [is] the Lord God who judgeth her.
>
> **18:9** And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
>
> **18:10** Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
>
> **18:15** The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
>
> **18:18** And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What [city is] like unto this great city!
>
> **18:21** And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast [it] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.

**Notes:** Basanismos (G929, "torment") appears in 18:7,10,15 for Babylon. But Babylon's "torment" IS her destruction: "utterly burned with fire" (v.8), "in one hour" (v.10), "thrown down, and shall be found no more at all" (v.21). The same word describes a completed destruction event.

---

#### Revelation 20:14-15 (Lake of Fire = Second Death)

> **20:14** And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
>
> **20:15** And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

#### Revelation 21:8 (Lake of Fire and Brimstone = Second Death)

> **21:8** But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

**Notes:** The lake of fire is explicitly defined as "the second death" -- death terminology, not torment terminology.

#### Revelation 1:1 (Signified)

> **1:1** The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified [it] by his angel unto his servant John:

**Notes:** "Signified" (esemenein, from semaino) = communicated through signs/symbols.

---

### E. OT Source Texts

#### Isaiah 34:8-17 (Edom's Judgment -- PRIMARY OT SOURCE)

> **34:8** For [it is] the day of the LORD'S vengeance, [and] the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.
>
> **34:9** And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
>
> **34:10** It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
>
> **34:11** But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
>
> **34:12** They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none [shall be] there, and all her princes shall be nothing.
>
> **34:13** And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, [and] a court for owls.
>
> **34:14** The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
>
> **34:15** There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.
>
> **34:16** Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.
>
> **34:17** And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

**CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS:**
1. v.9: "brimstone" (gophriyth, H1614) -- same word as Gen 19:24 Sodom
2. v.10: "not quenched night nor day" -- directly parallels Rev 14:11 "no rest day nor night"
3. v.10: "smoke thereof shall go up for ever" -- directly parallels Rev 14:11 "smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever"
4. v.10: "from generation to generation it shall lie waste" -- the result is permanent desolation, not ongoing combustion
5. vv.11-17: After the "smoke ascending for ever" and "not quenched night nor day" language, the SAME PASSAGE describes animals permanently dwelling in the desolate ruins -- cormorants, bitterns, owls, ravens, dragons, screech owls, great owls, vultures
6. v.14: "the screech owl also shall REST there" -- the land that "shall not be quenched night nor day" now has animals RESTING in it
7. v.17: "they shall possess it for ever" -- animals possess the land "for ever"
8. The smoke-formula in its OT source describes permanent uninhabitable desolation, not perpetual burning

---

#### Genesis 19:24-29 (Sodom's Destruction -- Foundational Type)

> **19:24** Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
>
> **19:25** And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
>
> **19:26** But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
>
> **19:27** And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
>
> **19:28** And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
>
> **19:29** And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

**Key observations:**
1. v.24: First biblical occurrence of "brimstone and fire" as divine judgment
2. v.25: "overthrew" -- destruction, not torment
3. v.28: "the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace" -- smoke from a completed destruction event, observed by Abraham
4. v.29: "when God destroyed" -- vocabulary is destruction, not ongoing torment
5. This is the foundational type for all subsequent fire-and-brimstone judgment imagery

---

#### Malachi 4:1-3 (Eschatological Judgment -- Burning Up)

> **4:1** For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
>
> **4:2** But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.
>
> **4:3** And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do [this], saith the LORD of hosts.

**Key observations:**
1. v.1: "shall be stubble" -- consumed by fire, not ongoing in fire
2. v.1: "burn them up" -- complete consumption, not ongoing torment
3. v.1: "leave them neither root nor branch" -- total destruction; nothing remains
4. v.3: "ashes under the soles of your feet" -- the wicked become ashes; they are treaded upon after destruction
5. This is an eschatological text (about "the day" that cometh) using fire imagery for complete consumption

---

#### Jude 1:7 (Sodom as Example of Eternal Fire)

> **1:7** Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

**Context (Jude 1:5-8):**
> **1:5** I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
>
> **1:6** And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
>
> **1:7** Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
>
> **1:8** Likewise also these [filthy] dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

**Notes:** Sodom is the "example" (deigma) of "eternal fire." The fire is "eternal" (aionios) in its effect, not in its duration as an active process -- Sodom is not still burning.

---

#### 2 Peter 2:6 (Sodom Turned to Ashes)

> **2:6** And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;

**Context (2 Pet 2:4-9):**
> **2:4** For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
>
> **2:5** And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person], a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
>
> **2:6** And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
>
> **2:9** The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:
>
> **2:12** But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;

**Notes:** "Turning... into ashes" (tephroo) and "overthrow" (katastrophe) -- destruction vocabulary. This is an "ensample" (hupodeigma) for the ungodly. The example teaches: fire + brimstone = ashes = overthrow.

---

### F. Additional OT Smoke and Fire Passages

#### Psalm 37:20 (Wicked Consume Into Smoke)

> **37:20** But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD [shall be] as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.

**Context (Psalm 37:17-22):**
> **37:17** For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
> **37:18** The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.
> **37:19** They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
> **37:20** But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD [shall be] as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
> **37:22** For [such as be] blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and [they that be] cursed of him shall be cut off.

**Notes:** Smoke = the END PRODUCT of consumption. Fat of lambs on the altar was consumed entirely -- nothing remained but smoke ascending. The wicked "consume away" and the smoke is the result of that consumption.

---

#### Psalm 68:2 (Smoke Driven Away)

> **68:1** Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.
>
> **68:2** As smoke is driven away, [so] drive [them] away: as wax melteth before the fire, [so] let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
>
> **68:3** But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

**Notes:** Smoke = driven away, dispersed, vanishing. Wax = melted, consumed. Both images describe disappearance and cessation, not ongoing existence. The wicked "perish" (abad).

---

#### Isaiah 51:6 (Heavens Vanish Like Smoke)

> **51:6** Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

**Notes:** Smoke = vanishing, ceasing to exist. Contrasted with God's salvation which endures "for ever."

---

#### Hosea 13:3 (Smoke from the Chimney)

> **13:3** Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff [that] is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.

**Notes:** Four images of transience: morning cloud, early dew, chaff, smoke from chimney. All dissipate, vanish, are gone. Smoke = ephemeral.

---

#### Isaiah 66:24 (Carcases, Worm, Fire)

> **66:24** And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.

**Notes:** Subject = "carcases" (peger = dead bodies/corpses), not living persons. Already registered as E192 (Cond.).

---

#### Ezekiel 28:18-19 (Fire from the Midst / Ashes / Never Be Any More)

> **28:18** Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
>
> **28:19** All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never [shalt] thou [be] any more.

**Notes:** Fire devours, produces ashes, and the subject is "never... any more." Fire leads to non-existence, not eternal conscious suffering.

---

#### Isaiah 1:28-31 (Transgressors Consumed / Burn Together)

> **1:28** And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners [shall be] together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
>
> **1:29** For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
>
> **1:30** For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
>
> **1:31** And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench [them].

**Notes:** "None shall quench" parallels Isa 34:10 "not be quenched." The fire is unquenchable but the fuel is consumed -- tow (flax fiber) burns rapidly and completely. "None shall quench" describes the irresistibility of the fire, not its eternal duration.

---

#### Nahum 1:5-10 (God's Judgment -- Complete End)

> **1:5** The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
>
> **1:6** Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.
>
> **1:7** The LORD [is] good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.
>
> **1:8** But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
>
> **1:9** What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.
>
> **1:10** For while [they be] folden together [as] thorns, and while they are drunken [as] drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.

**Notes:** v.6 "fury poured out like fire"; v.8 "utter end"; v.9 "utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time"; v.10 "devoured as stubble fully dry." Fire imagery paired with "utter end" and "devoured" -- destruction, not ongoing torment. "Shall not rise up the second time" = finality.

### G. Babylon Desolation Parallels

#### Isaiah 13:19-22

> **13:19** And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
>
> **13:20** It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
>
> **13:21** But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.
>
> **13:22** And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in [their] pleasant palaces: and her time [is] near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

#### Jeremiah 50:39-40

> **50:39** Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell [there], and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
>
> **50:40** As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour [cities] thereof, saith the LORD; [so] shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.

**Notes:** Same pattern as Isa 34: destruction compared to Sodom's overthrow, followed by permanent desolation with wild animals inhabiting the ruins. "No more inhabited for ever" = permanent desolation, not ongoing burning.

---

### H. NT Support Passages

#### Matthew 25:41,46

> **25:41** Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
>
> **25:46** And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

#### 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9

> **1:7** And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
>
> **1:8** In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
>
> **1:9** Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;

**Notes:** "Everlasting destruction" -- the punishment is destruction, modified by "everlasting." The destruction is permanent, not reversible.

#### Psalm 11:6

> **11:6** Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: [this shall be] the portion of their cup.

**Notes:** Echoes Gen 19:24. "Fire and brimstone" = divine judgment. "The portion of their cup" parallels Rev 14:10 "the cup of his indignation."

#### Isaiah 30:33 (Tophet)

> **30:33** For Tophet [is] ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made [it] deep [and] large: the pile thereof [is] fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.

#### Ezekiel 38:22

> **38:22** And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that [are] with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

#### Deuteronomy 29:23

> **29:23** [And that] the whole land thereof [is] brimstone, and salt, [and] burning, [that] it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:

**Notes:** Describes the aftermath of Sodom's brimstone judgment -- "not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth" = permanent desolation of the land.

#### Luke 17:29

> **17:29** But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed [them] all.

**Notes:** Jesus' own description of Sodom's fire and brimstone: "destroyed them all." Destruction vocabulary.
