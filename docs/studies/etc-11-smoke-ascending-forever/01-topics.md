# Topics Research — etc5-11-smoke-ascending-forever

## Question

What does Revelation 14:9-11 mean when it says "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever"? What does Revelation 19:3 mean when it says Babylon's "smoke rose up for ever and ever"? What is the OT source of this imagery? Does "smoke ascending for ever" describe ongoing conscious torment, or does it describe the permanent/complete nature of the destruction? Are there OT examples where "smoke ascending for ever" describes destruction that is clearly finished?

## Topics

### SMOKE

**Nave's entry:**
> SMOKE
> -FIGURATIVE ISA 6:4; HOS 13:3

**Annotation:** Nave's SMOKE entry is minimal — only two figurative references. The entry itself confirms that "smoke" in Scripture is fundamentally figurative language. Isa 6:4 (the temple filled with smoke at Isaiah's vision) and Hos 13:3 (smoke out of a chimney as image of Israel's transience and disappearing) are the anchoring references.

**Contextual note:** The substantive biblical data on smoke-ascending-forever is found through the PUNISHMENT ETERNAL sub-entry and through the cross-testament parallel tool, not through the SMOKE entry itself. This indicates that Nave's does not categorize the "smoke ascending for ever" passages (Isa 34:10; Rev 14:11; Rev 19:3) primarily as "smoke" imagery but rather as eternal punishment imagery. That categorization itself is noteworthy.

**Hosea 13:3 (full Nave's SMOKE figurative reference):**
> Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff [that] is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.

Here smoke = impermanence, transience, disappearing. The smoke goes up and is gone. This is the dominant OT semantic for "smoke" as simile: it describes something that vanishes.

**Isaiah 6:4 (second Nave's SMOKE figurative reference):**
Isaiah 6:4 describes the temple filling with smoke at God's theophanic presence — smoke as divine majesty/presence. Not directly relevant to the smoke-ascending-forever question but establishes the awe-inspiring character of divine smoke.

### TORMENTS

**Nave's entry:**
> TORMENTS
> -Of the wicked LUK 16:23-28; REV 14:10,11
> -See WICKED, PUNISMENT OF

**Annotation:** Nave's TORMENTS entry lists only two passages:
1. Luke 16:23-28 (Lazarus and rich man — the rich man in Hades, seeing Abraham afar off, asks for mercy)
2. Rev 14:10,11 (the beast-mark torment passage)

The entry explicitly links torments of the wicked to the WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF cross-reference, placing this within the broader judgment framework. The Lukan passage describes the basanos (torment, G931 — related to G928 basanizō) of the rich man in Hades, in the period before the resurrection/judgment — note this is a different Greek word (G931 basanos, "touchstone, torture") used in Luke 16 vs. the G928/G929 words in Revelation.

### BRIMSTONE

**Nave's entry:**
> BRIMSTONE
> -Fire and, rained upon Sodom GEN 19:24; LUK 17:29
> -In Palestine DEU 29:23
> -FIGURATIVE JOB 18:15; PSA 11:6; ISA 30:33; EZK 38:22; REV 9:17,18; 14:10; 19:20; 21:8

**Annotation:** Nave's places brimstone in two categories:

1. **Historical/literal:** Sodom (Gen 19:24; Luk 17:29); Palestine (Deu 29:23)
   - The foundational literal use: the LORD rained brimstone and fire on Sodom. This is the anchor event.
   - Luke 17:29 explicitly says "it rained fire and brimstone from heaven" on the day Lot left Sodom.

2. **Figurative:** Job 18:15 (brimstone scattered on the wicked); Psa 11:6 (fire, brimstone, and horrible tempest as God's portion for the wicked); Isa 30:33 (Tophet prepared, with fire and brimstone); Ezk 38:22 (Gog judgment — fire and brimstone); Rev 9:17,18; 14:10; 19:20; 21:8 (Revelation uses).

**NOTE:** ALL the Revelation brimstone uses are listed by Nave's as FIGURATIVE. This aligns with the Sodom-type judgment imagery: the lake of fire and brimstone (Rev 19:20; 20:10; 21:8) draws on the same Sodom/Gomorrah destruction imagery, which Nave's treats as the literal anchor. The cross-testament parallel tool confirms H1614 (gophrith, brimstone) → G2303 (theion) with perfect 1:1 LXX mapping.

**Isaiah 34:9** contains H1614 (brimstone/gophrith): "the dust thereof into brimstone." This is the verse immediately preceding the "smoke ascending for ever" verse (Isa 34:10). The fire-and-brimstone pattern of Sodom is replicated in Edom's judgment before the smoke-ascending-forever formula appears.

### PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL (sub-entry under PUNISHMENT)

**Nave's entry (ETERNAL sub-entry):**
> PUNISHMENT
> ...
> -ETERNAL ISA 34:8-10; DAN 12:2; MAT 3:12; 10:28; 18:8; 25:41,46; MRK 3:29; LUK 3:17; JHN 5:29; HEB 6:2; 10:28-31; REV 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10

**Annotation:** This is the most critical Nave's entry for this study. Key observations:

1. **Isaiah 34:8-10 is the FIRST citation** in the ETERNAL PUNISHMENT sub-entry — listed before all NT passages. This confirms Nave's categorizes Isa 34:8-10 (Edom's smoke ascending for ever) as eternal punishment. This entry itself is an evidence data point: if Isa 34:8-10 describes "eternal punishment," what kind does it describe? Given that Isa 34:11-17 shows animals dwelling in the desolate land afterward (no ongoing burning, no ongoing conscious suffering), the "eternal" character is its finality and permanence, not its duration.

2. **The full list of NT eternal punishment passages:**
   - Dan 12:2 — "everlasting contempt"
   - Mat 3:12 — "unquenchable fire" (chaff burned)
   - Mat 10:28 — destroy both soul and body in hell
   - Mat 18:8 — "everlasting fire"
   - Mat 25:41,46 — "everlasting fire" / "everlasting punishment"
   - Mrk 3:29 — "eternal damnation" (never forgiveness)
   - Luk 3:17 — "unquenchable fire"
   - Jhn 5:29 — "resurrection of damnation"
   - Heb 6:2 — "eternal judgment"
   - Heb 10:28-31 — "sorer punishment"
   - Rev 14:10,11 — fire, brimstone, smoke ascending for ever
   - Rev 19:3 — Babylon's smoke for ever
   - Rev 20:10 — tormented day and night for ever

3. **Structural significance:** Rev 19:3 (Babylon's smoke for ever) is listed alongside Rev 14:10,11 and Rev 20:10 in this ETERNAL PUNISHMENT sub-entry. Nave's treats all three as the same type of reference. Yet Babylon is a city, not a person — and Babylon is clearly destroyed/desolate, not perpetually burning. This confirms the analysis-agent will need to address whether "smoke ascending for ever" can serve as an eternal punishment formula even when the entity destroyed is a city.

### BABYLON (figurative)

**Nave's entry (relevant portion):**
> BABYLON
> ...
> -FIGURATIVE REV 14:8; 16:19; 17; 18

**Full Nave's entry (excerpt — CITY OF):**
> Splendor of ISA 14:4
> Prophecies concerning PSA 87:4; 137:8,9; ISA 13; 14:4-26; 21:1-10; 46:1,2; 47; 48:14,20; JER 21:4-10; 25:12-14; 27:1-11; 28:14; 32:28; 34:2,3; 42:11,12; 43; 46:13-26; 49:28-30; 50; 51; EZK 21:19; 26; 29:17-20; 30:10; 32:11; DAN 2:21-38; 4:10-26; 5:25-29; 7; HAB 1:5-11; ZEC 2:7-9
> FIGURATIVE REV 14:8; 16:19; 17; 18

**Annotation:** Nave's marks Rev 14:8; 16:19; 17; 18 as FIGURATIVE uses of "Babylon" — the Revelation Babylon is identified by Nave's as a figurative/symbolic entity, not the literal ancient city. This is significant because the smoke-ascending-forever of Rev 19:3 refers to this figurative Babylon, not literal ancient Babylon (though the destruction imagery draws on the literal OT prophecies).

The OT prophecies about Babylon's desolation (Isa 13:19-22; 14:22-23; Jer 50:39-40; 51:37,58) describe it as: destroyed like Sodom; never inhabited forever; dwelling place of wild animals; the walls burned with fire. These are permanent desolation descriptions, not ongoing burning descriptions. Rev 18 draws directly on these OT prophecies in its description of Babylon's fall.

### EDOM

**Nave's entry:**
> EDOM
> -(Signifies red)
> 1. A name of Esau, possibly on account of his being covered with red hair GEN 25:25,30; 36:1,8,19
> 2. A name of the land occupied by the descendants of Esau
>    -It extended from the Elanitic Gulf to the Red Sea, and was also called IDUMEA GEN 32:3; 36:16,17,21; JER 40:11
>    -Noted for its wise men OBA 1:8
>    -Sins of OBA 1:10-14
>    -Prophecies concerning JER 25:21-23; 27:1-11; DAN 11:41
>    -See EDOMITES
>    -FIGURATIVE of the foes of Zion ISA 63:1
>    -Wilderness of 2KI 3:8

**Annotation:** Nave's EDOM entry does NOT include Isa 34 — the smoke-ascending-forever chapter about Edom/Idumea. This is because Isa 34 is an extended oracle against "Idumea" (the Greek/Latin form of Edom; Isa 34:5 says "it shall come down upon Idumea"). The absence from Nave's EDOM entry is a categorization gap, but the cross-testament parallel tool identified Isa 34:10 as the #1 OT parallel for both Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3, confirming its importance regardless.

The EDOM entry does confirm that Edom's fate involved specific "Prophecies concerning JER 25:21-23" — Jeremiah 25 is the cup-of-wrath passage where all nations drink the wine of God's wrath (cf. Rev 14:10 — same cup imagery).

### SODOM

**Nave's entry:**
> SODOM
> -Also called SODOMA
> -Situated on the plain of the Jordan River GEN 13:10
> -The southeastern limit of the Canaanites GEN 10:19
> -Lot lived in GEN 13:12
> -King of, joins other kings of the nations resisting the invasion of Chedorlaomer GEN 14:1-12
> -Wickedness of the inhabitants of GEN 13:13; 19:4-13; DEU 32:32; ISA 3:9; JER 23:14; LAM 4:6; EZK 16:46,48,49; Jude 1:7
> -Abraham's intercession for GEN 18:16-33
> -Destroyed on account of the wickedness of the people GEN 19:1-29; DEU 29:23; ISA 13:19; JER 49:18; 50:40; LAM 4:6; AMO 4:11; ZEP 2:9; MAT 10:15; LUK 17:29; ROM 9:29; 2PE 2:6
> -FIGURATIVE
>    -Of wickedness DEU 23:17; 32:32; ISA 1:10; EZK 16:46-56

**Annotation:** The SODOM entry lists Jude 1:7 under "Wickedness of the inhabitants of" — Jude cites Sodom as an example of those "suffering the vengeance of eternal fire." Nave's places 2 Pet 2:6 under "Destroyed on account of the wickedness of the people" — the passage that says Sodom was "turned into ashes."

**Critical cross-reference chain within Nave's SODOM entry:**
- Sodom destroyed → ISA 13:19 (Babylon destroyed LIKE Sodom) — this confirms the Sodom-Babylon typology
- Sodom destroyed → JER 49:18; 50:40 — both Edom and Babylon compared to Sodom's overthrow
- Sodom destroyed → 2PE 2:6 (ashes)

**The Sodom→Edom→Babylon typological chain:**
1. Sodom destroyed with fire and brimstone (Gen 19:24) → smoke ascending as smoke of furnace (Gen 19:28)
2. Edom destroyed → streams into pitch, dust into brimstone (Isa 34:9) → smoke ascending for ever and ever (Isa 34:10)
3. Babylon destroyed like Sodom (Isa 13:19; Jer 50:40) → smoke ascending for ever and ever (Rev 19:3)
4. Beast-worshippers tormented with fire and brimstone → smoke of their torment ascending for ever (Rev 14:11)

Jude 1:7 (Sodom = eternal fire) + 2 Pet 2:6 (Sodom = ashes) together define what "eternal fire" means: it consumed them to ashes permanently. The fire is eternal in its effects, not in its ongoing duration. This is N029, established in etc5-08.

### PUNISHMENT sub-entries (additional relevant data)

The PUNISHMENT entry also contains:
- **DIVINE — No Escape from:** JOB 11:20; PRO 1:24-31; 11:21; 16:5; 29:1; JER 11:11; 15:1; 25:28,29; EZK 7:19; AMO 2:14-16; ZEP 1:18; MAT 10:28; 23:33; ROM 2:3; COL 3:25; HEB 2:3; 12:25
  - This confirms the inescapability of divine punishment — no one will escape. The "no rest day nor night" language of Rev 14:11 may be expressing this inescapability (no respite, no reprieve) rather than necessarily ongoing duration.

- **ACCORDING TO DEEDS:** JOB 34:11; PSA 62:12; PRO 12:14; 24:12; ISA 59:18; JER 17:10; EZK 7:3,27; 16:59; 39:24; ZEC 1:6; MAT 5:22; 16:27; 23:14; LUK 12:47,48; 20:47
  - Multiple levels/degrees of punishment, which is more consistent with both conditionalism (some destroyed more severely) and ECT (varying intensity of torment).
