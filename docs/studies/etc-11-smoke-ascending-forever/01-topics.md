## Question

Rev 14:9-11, 19:3 -- OT source imagery (Isa 34:9-10, Gen 19:28, Mal 4:1-3). Ongoing torment vs. permanent destruction? Apply Tree 3 genre gate.

**Expanded question:** What do Revelation 14:9-11 and 19:3 describe? What is the OT background for the imagery of smoke ascending "for ever and ever," fire and brimstone, and "no rest day nor night"? Does this language describe ongoing conscious torment, or does it describe the permanent and complete nature of destruction?

### BRIMSTONE

**Full Nave's Entry:**
- Fire and, rained upon Sodom GEN 19:24; LUK 17:29
- In Palestine DEU 29:23
- FIGURATIVE JOB 18:15; PSA 11:6; ISA 30:33; EZK 38:22; REV 9:17,18; 14:10; 19:20; 21:8

**Key observations:**
- The first biblical occurrence of brimstone (Gen 19:24) describes Sodom's destruction -- a completed, ended judgment
- Nave's classifies the majority of brimstone references as FIGURATIVE (6 of 8 references)
- All NT brimstone references (Rev 9:17,18; 14:10; 19:20; 21:8; Luke 17:29) are categorized under FIGURATIVE
- Luke 17:29, the only non-Revelation NT use, refers to Sodom -- a completed destruction
- Every OT brimstone passage describes an act of destruction, not ongoing torment

### SMOKE

**Full Nave's Entry:**
- FIGURATIVE ISA 6:4; HOS 13:3

**Key observations:**
- Nave's only lists two FIGURATIVE uses of smoke
- Hos 13:3: "as the smoke out of the chimney" -- listed under WICKED PEOPLE, "Compared with" alongside morning clouds, early dew, chaff -- all images of transience and vanishing
- Isa 6:4: smoke fills the temple at God's presence (theophany)
- The Nave's classification of smoke as "figurative" and its association with transience (Hos 13:3) is significant

### PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL

**Key observations:**
- Isa 34:8-10 is the FIRST OT citation under "eternal punishment" -- Nave's itself categorizes Edom's judgment as an "eternal punishment" text
- The Isa 34:8-10 passage describes Edom, which is not still burning (animals inhabit the territory, Isa 34:11-17)
- Mat 10:28 is included -- "destroy both soul and body in hell" (destruction vocabulary, not torment vocabulary)
- Rev 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10 are the Revelation passages central to this study
- Cross-references: See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

  - Satan bound for one-thousand years REV 20:1-3
