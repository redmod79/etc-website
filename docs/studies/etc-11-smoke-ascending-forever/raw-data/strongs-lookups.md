## G929 — βασανισμός (basanismos) — torment (noun)

**Occurrence count:** 6 total (but note: lexicon shows 5 distinct references; the 6th occurrence may be a repeated verse)

```
     5 ( 83.3%) torment
     1 ( 16.7%) the torment
```

**Lexicon entry:**
- Transliteration: basanismós
- Pronunciation: bas-an-is-mos
- Part of Speech: masculine noun (n-m)

- Definition: from G928; torture:—torment.
- Outline of Biblical Usage:
  Revelation 9:5; 14:11; 18:7; 18:10; 18:15

**CRITICAL NOTE:** G929 appears ONLY in Revelation — never outside Revelation in the NT. All 5 distinct occurrences are within Revelation. Three of the five (18:7, 18:10, 18:15) describe Babylon's judgment/destruction — a clearly completed, finite event. One (9:5) describes limited 5-month scorpion-sting torment. One (14:11) describes the torment of beast-worshippers.

**Lexicon entry:**
- Transliteration: basanízō
- Pronunciation: bas-an-id-zo
- Part of Speech: verb (v)
- BLB Count: 12
- Definition: from G931; to torture:—pain, toil, torment, toss, vex.

**Categorized uses:**
- Physical pain/illness: Mat 8:6 (servant sick, tormented)

- Demon fearful of torment: Mat 8:29; Mk 5:7; Lk 8:28 ("torment us")

## G372 — ἀνάπαυσις (anapausis) — rest (noun)

**Occurrence count:** 5 total (but note: lexicon shows 6 references including Philemon 1:7)

```
     4 ( 80.0%) rest
     1 ( 20.0%) they rest
```

**Lexicon entry:**
- Transliteration: anápausis
- Pronunciation: an-ap-ow-sis
- Part of Speech: feminine noun (n-f)
- BLB Count: 5 (or 6 with Philemon)
- Definition: from G373; intermission; by implication, recreation:—rest.
- Outline of Biblical Usage:
  Matthew 11:29; 12:43 | Luke 11:24 | Philemon 1:7 | Revelation 4:8; 14:11

**KEY CONTRAST:** Rev 4:8 uses G372 for the living creatures who "rest not (anapausin ouk ekhousin) day and night" in ongoing worship — this is their positive continuous activity. Rev 14:11 uses the identical phrase "they have no rest (anapausin ouk ekhousin) day nor night" for beast-worshippers — negative. The Greek structure is grammatically identical.

## G373 — ἀναπαύω (anapauō) — rest (verb)

**Occurrence count:** 13 total (BLB shows 12), 10 unique translations

```
     4 ( 30.8%) rest

     1 (  7.7%) take thine ease
     1 (  7.7%) they have refreshed

```

**Lexicon entry:**
- Transliteration: anapaúō
- Part of Speech: verb (v)
- BLB Count: 12
- Definition: from G303 and G3973; (reflexively) to repose (literally or figuratively [be exempt], remain); also transitively, to refresh:—give rest, (give, take) rest(-ful, -ing).
- Outline of Biblical Usage:
  Isaiah 11:2 | Matthew 11:28; 26:45 | Mark 6:31; 14:41 | Luke 12:19 | 1 Corinthians 16:18 | 2 Corinthians 7:13 | Philemon 1:7; 1:20 | 1 Peter 4:14 | Revelation 6:11; 6:11; 14:13; 14:13

**CRITICAL:** Rev 6:11 (souls under altar told to rest anapausōntai) and Rev 14:13 (blessed dead "rest from their labours," using same form anapausōntai) — the same verb form used positively for the redeemed. This connects to E242 established in etc5-10.

```

**Lexicon entry:**
- Transliteration: ʻâshân
- Pronunciation: aw-shawn
- Part of Speech: masculine noun (n-m)
- BLB Count: 25
- Definition: from H6226; smoke, literally or figuratively (vapor, dust, anger):—smoke(-ing).
- Full outline: Genesis 15:17 | Exodus 19:16,18 | Joshua 8:20,21 | Judges 20:38,40 | 2 Samuel 22:9 | Job 41:12 | Psalms 18:9; 37:20; 68:3; 102:4 | Proverbs 10:26 | Song of Songs 3:6 | Isaiah 4:5; 6:4; 9:17; 14:31; 34:10; 34:10; 51:6; 65:5 | Hosea 13:3 | Joel 3:3

**LXX mapping:** H6227 → G2586 (kapnos): count 20, PMI 9.95, score 30.28 (dominant mapping)

**KEY DATA POINT:** Isaiah 34:10 contains H6227 TWICE in a single verse — "the smoke thereof (ashanah) shall go up for ever." The LXX renders this with G2586 (kapnos) — the same word John uses in Rev 14:11 and 19:3.

## H1614 — גׇּפְרִית (gophrith) — brimstone (Hebrew)

**Occurrence count:** 7 total, 4 unique translations

- LXX mapping: H1614 → G2303 (theion): count 7, PMI 11.01, score 22.89 (perfect 1:1 mapping)

**NOTE:** Isaiah 34:9 contains H1614 (brimstone/gophrith) — the verse immediately preceding the "smoke ascending for ever" of verse 10. The Sodom-destruction imagery of fire and brimstone connects directly to the smoke formula.

## H5769 — עוֹלָם (olam) — for ever / everlasting (Hebrew)

**Occurrence count:** 432 total, 40 unique translations

```
   198 ( 45.8%) for ever

```

**Lexicon entry:**
- Transliteration: ʻôwlâm
- Pronunciation: o-lawm
- Part of Speech: masculine noun (n-m)
- BLB Count: 439
- Definition: from H5956; properly, concealed, i.e. the vanishing point; generally, time out of mind (past or future), i.e. (practically) eternity; frequentatively, adverbial (especially with prepositional prefix) always:—alway(-s), ancient (time), any more, continuance, eternal, (for, (n-)) ever(-lasting, -more, of old), lasting, long (time), (of) old (time), perpetual, at any time, (beginning of the) world (without end).

**KEY OCCURRENCES IN STUDY CONTEXT:**
- Isaiah 34:10: "the smoke thereof shall go up for ever (leolam)" — H5769
- Isaiah 34:10: "none shall pass through it for ever and ever (leolam vaed)" — H5769 + H5703
- Isaiah 34:17: "they shall possess it for ever (leolam), from generation to generation" — H5769
- Jeremiah 50:39: "it shall be no more inhabited for ever (leolam)" — H5769 (of Babylon)
- Isaiah 13:20: "It shall never (leolam) be inhabited" — H5769 (of Babylon)

**SEMANTIC RANGE NOTE:** H5769 is derived from H5956 (to conceal, vanish). Its basic meaning is "the vanishing point" — the horizon of time where things disappear from view. Applied to desolation (Isa 34:10; Jer 50:39), it describes permanent irreversibility, not necessarily endless ongoing activity. The same word describes God's eternal existence, but also describes "permanent ruination" of cities that are clearly not burning forever.

## H5331 — נֶצַח (netsach) — for ever / perpetual / continually

**Occurrence count:** 44 total, 18 unique translations

```
    21 ( 47.7%) for ever
     3 (  6.8%) perpetual
     3 (  6.8%) never
     2 (  4.5%) always
     2 (  4.5%) ever
     ... (various)
```

**Lexicon entry:**
- Transliteration: netsach
- Pronunciation: neh-tsakh
- Part of Speech: masculine noun (n-m)
- BLB Count: 43
- Definition: from H5329; properly, a goal, i.e. the bright object at a distance travelled towards; hence (figuratively), splendor, or (subjectively) truthfulness, or (objectively) confidence; but usually (adverbially), continually (i.e. to the most distant point of view):—alway(-s), constantly, end, (n-) ever(more), perpetual, strength, victory.

**KEY OCCURRENCE:** Isaiah 34:10 uses H5331 ("netsach") in parallel with H5769 — "It shall not be quenched night nor day" — this verse's "for ever" vocabulary involves BOTH H5769 and H5331. Isaiah 13:20 also uses H5331 ("It shall never [leolam] be inhabited") — Babylon's desolation is described with H5769.

Other occurrences in study context: Jeremiah 50:39 (netsach — Babylon "no more inhabited for ever").
