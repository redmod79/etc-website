# Smoke Ascending Forever — Plain English Summary
## Revelation 14:9-11 and 19:3

## What This Study Is About

Revelation 14:10-11 describes the fate of those who worship the beast: they "shall be tormented with fire and brimstone... and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night." Revelation 19:3 uses the same phrase — "her smoke rose up for ever and ever" — for Babylon.

The central question is: does "smoke ascending for ever" describe ongoing, conscious, endless torment? Or does it describe the permanent and complete nature of a destruction that has already occurred?

To answer this, the study traces every piece of imagery in these verses back to its Old Testament source.

## Key Finding 1: The "Smoke Ascending Forever" Formula Comes from Isaiah 34

The most important discovery in this study is that John's language in Revelation 14:11 is drawn directly from Isaiah 34:10, which describes God's judgment on Edom:

> "It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever." — Isaiah 34:10

The wording is nearly identical. But here is what Isaiah says immediately after this "smoke for ever" statement: the same desolate land is described as filled with cormorants, bitterns, owls, ravens, jackals, and other animals dwelling permanently in the ruins (Isaiah 34:11-17). The screech owl "shall rest there" (Isaiah 34:14).

Animals do not nest in a place where fire is still burning and smoke is still rising. The "smoke ascending for ever" and "not quenched night nor day" language, in its own Old Testament context, describes the permanent desolation that follows a completed destruction — not an ongoing fire. Edom is not still burning. The formula means the judgment is final and permanent, not that combustion is eternal.

## Key Finding 2: Fire and Brimstone Always Means Destruction, Not Torment

Every occurrence of fire-and-brimstone judgment in the Old Testament describes an act of destruction with a permanent result. The pattern begins with Sodom:

> "The LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities." — Genesis 19:24-25

Abraham watched the aftermath: "the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace" (Genesis 19:28) — smoke rising from a completed destruction, not from ongoing suffering.

The New Testament confirms this reading. Jesus says the fire and brimstone "destroyed them all" (Luke 17:29). Peter says God turned "the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes" as "an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly" (2 Peter 2:6). Jude 1:7 calls Sodom's destruction "the vengeance of eternal fire" — and Sodom is not still burning. The "eternal" fire produced an eternal result: total destruction.

The prophet Malachi, in the Old Testament's clearest eschatological fire-judgment passage, describes the wicked this way:

> "Shall burn them up... leave them neither root nor branch." — Malachi 4:1
> "They shall be ashes under the soles of your feet." — Malachi 4:3

Other prophets use the same imagery of complete consumption: "into smoke shall they consume away" (Psalm 37:20); fire shall devour the wicked, producing ashes, and the subject is "never... any more" (Ezekiel 28:18-19); the enemies of God are "devoured as stubble fully dry" with "utter end" (Nahum 1:8-10).

## Key Finding 3: "Torment" in Revelation Also Describes Completed Destruction

The Greek word translated "torment" in Revelation 14:11 is *basanismos*. This word appears exactly six times in the entire New Testament — all six in Revelation. Three of those six occurrences describe Babylon's "torment" (Revelation 18:7, 10, 15).

But Babylon's "torment" is explicitly described as a completed destruction:

> "She shall be utterly burned with fire." — Revelation 18:8
> "In one hour is thy judgment come." — Revelation 18:10
> "Thrown down, and shall be found no more at all." — Revelation 18:21

And in Revelation 19:3, John records: "her smoke rose up for ever and ever" — the identical smoke formula applied to Babylon, who has already been completely destroyed and "found no more at all."

So the very same smoke formula that appears in Revelation 14:11 is applied in Revelation 19:3 to a destroyed city. And the word "torment" used in Revelation 14:11 is the same word used in Revelation 18 to describe what is explicitly called Babylon's completed destruction. Within Revelation itself, this language describes permanent, total destruction.

## Key Finding 4: "No Rest Day Nor Night" Describes Intensity, Not Eternal Duration

Revelation 14:11 says the beast-worshippers "have no rest day nor night." But the same Greek word for "rest" (*anapausis*) appears just ten chapters earlier:

> "The four living creatures rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty." — Revelation 4:8

Here, the living creatures "rest not day and night" in their ceaseless praise of God — obviously not because they are suffering forever, but because their worship is unceasing and uninterrupted. The phrase "no rest day and night" describes the continuous, unrelenting nature of something during its execution. The same author uses the same word in both places.

## Key Finding 5: Revelation 20 Uses Different Language for Different Subjects

Revelation 20 makes a notable distinction in its vocabulary:

- Human enemies are "devoured" by fire (Revelation 20:9) — destruction language.
- The devil, the beast, and the false prophet are "tormented day and night for ever and ever" (Revelation 20:10) — the beast and false prophet being symbolic figures, not individual human beings.
- When human beings enter the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14-15; 21:8), the text calls it "the second death" — death terminology, not torment terminology.

Scripture states that the lake of fire "is the second death" (Revelation 21:8). Death, not endless conscious suffering, is the identifying term applied to human beings in the lake of fire.

## What This Means

The annihilation view (that the wicked are destroyed permanently, not tormented forever) is supported by a consistent chain of evidence:

- The "smoke ascending for ever" formula, traced to its Old Testament source (Isaiah 34), describes permanent desolation after a completed destruction — not ongoing combustion.
- Every Old Testament fire-and-brimstone passage describes destructive judgment, not conscious torment. Jesus, Peter, and Jude all confirm this for Sodom.
- Within Revelation itself, the same "torment" word and the same "smoke for ever" formula are applied to Babylon's completed destruction.
- The "no rest day and night" phrase describes the intensity of something during its execution, not necessarily its eternal duration (as shown by Revelation 4:8).
- The fate assigned specifically to human beings in the lake of fire is called "the second death," not torment.

The eternal torment view reads Revelation 14:10-11's surface language (tormented, smoke, for ever and ever, no rest) as a literal description of conscious, endless suffering. That reading is possible if taken in isolation. But when the verse is read in light of its Old Testament source, its same-book parallels, and the consistent fire-and-brimstone paradigm throughout Scripture, the weight of evidence points in the other direction: the imagery describes the absolute permanence and completeness of destruction, not ongoing conscious existence in suffering.

## Conclusion

The "smoke ascending for ever" in Revelation 14:11 and 19:3 is drawn from Isaiah 34:10, where the same formula describes Edom's ended judgment — followed immediately by animals dwelling in the ruins. The fire-and-brimstone paradigm, from Sodom onward through every Old Testament occurrence, describes destructive judgment whose result is permanent desolation, not eternal torment. Jesus says fire and brimstone "destroyed them all." Peter says Sodom became "ashes." Jude says it is "an example" — and Sodom does not still burn.

Within Revelation, the "torment" word is used for Babylon's completed destruction, and the same smoke formula is applied to utterly destroyed Babylon. The fate assigned to human beings entering the lake of fire is called "the second death."

The claim that Revelation 14:10-11 teaches eternal conscious torment as a settled doctrine requires reading apocalyptic vision imagery as literal description, detaching the smoke formula from its Old Testament source where it demonstrably does not mean ongoing combustion, and treating "torment" as meaning eternal conscious suffering when Revelation's own usage applies the same word to completed destruction. The evidence, taken as a whole, does not support that reading.
