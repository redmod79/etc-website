# Bible Study: "Smoke Ascending Forever" -- Revelation 14:9-11, 19:3, and OT Source Imagery

## Question

Rev 14:9-11, 19:3 -- OT source imagery (Isa 34:9-10, Gen 19:28, Mal 4:1-3). Ongoing torment vs. permanent destruction? Apply Tree 3 genre gate.

**Expanded question:** What do Revelation 14:9-11 and 19:3 describe? What is the OT background for the imagery of smoke ascending "for ever and ever," fire and brimstone, and "no rest day nor night"? Does this language describe ongoing conscious torment, or does it describe the permanent and complete nature of destruction? How do the OT source texts (Isa 34:9-10 on Edom, Gen 19:24-28 on Sodom, Mal 4:1-3 on the wicked) inform the interpretation of these Revelation passages? Apply Tree 3 genre gate: all primary passages are in Revelation's apocalyptic framework.

**Key prior findings directly relevant to this study:**

1. **etc-07 (olam study):** Olam (H5769) does not inherently mean "endless"; duration is determined by context and subject (N031). Olam fire/smoke judgments (Edom Isa 34:10, Jerusalem Jer 17:4) have demonstrably ended (N035). Strongest "forever" form (netsach netsachim) applied to Edom's judgment, which has ended (E293). God's wrath is explicitly denied to be perpetual (E292, netsach in Ps 103:9; Isa 57:16; Jer 3:5).

2. **etc-08 (aionios study):** Aionios (G166) does not inherently mean "eternal/endless" (N036; past-time uses in Rom 16:25, 2 Tim 1:9, Tit 1:2). "Ages of ages" formula in judgment contexts (Rev 14:11; 19:3; 20:10) uses the same idiom as OT olam/netsach smoke language for completed judgments (N039). Rev 14:11 echoes Isa 34:10 (E315). Rev 19:3 describes symbolic Babylon (E316). Rev 20:10 subjects are devil, beast, false prophet -- latter two symbolic (E125). Rev 20:9 uses "devoured" for human enemies (E254). Three I-B items resolved Strong: I043, I044, I045.

3. **etc-06 (destruction vocabulary):** Destruction vocabulary and torment vocabulary are distinct word families (N030, E260). No lexicon defines any of the seven destruction words as "torment" or "ongoing conscious suffering" (E264).

4. **etc-10 (souls under the altar):** Revelation classified as VISION by Nave's (E349). Rev 1:1 communicates through signs/semainO (E350). Tree 3 applied to Rev 6:9-11: Gate 1 FAIL (symbolic vision-figure), Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic genre). Reclassified Neutral.

5. **etc-05 (four hell words):** Beast and false prophet are symbolic entities (E205). No gehenna passage uses torment vocabulary for human beings (E197). Isaiah 66:24 describes corpses (E192).

- Note: Rev 11:15 ("he shall reign for ever and ever") and Rev 22:5 ("they shall reign for ever and ever") use the same phrase for divine/redeemed reign. All three judgment uses (14:11; 19:3; 20:10) use the same formula as these doxological uses.

#### OT Source Texts (critical -- what Revelation draws from)

**Isaiah 34:8-17 -- Edom's Judgment (primary OT source)**
- Isa 34:8: "For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion."
- Isa 34:9: "the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch"
- Isa 34:10: "It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever."
- Isa 34:11-17: Birds and wild animals possess the land; pelicans, hedgehogs, owls, ravens, thorns, nettles, brambles, jackals, ostriches. "The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island" (v.14). "None shall want her mate" (v.16). "They shall possess it for ever" (v.17).
- CRITICAL NOTE: After the "smoke ascending for ever" and "not quenched night nor day" language (v.10), the SAME PASSAGE describes animals dwelling permanently in the desolate ruins (vv.11-17). The land is uninhabited by humans, not perpetually burning. The smoke-formula describes permanent desolation, not ongoing combustion.

**Genesis 19:24-28 -- Sodom's Destruction (foundational type)**
- Gen 19:24: "the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven"
- Gen 19:25: "he overthrew those cities"
- Gen 19:28: "lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."

**Malachi 4:1-3 -- The Wicked Burned Up (OT eschatological judgment)**
- Mal 4:1: "the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch."
- Mal 4:3: "ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts."
- NOTE: The wicked are "stubble" burned up, leaving "neither root nor branch." They become "ashes under the soles of your feet." Both images describe complete consumption, not ongoing burning. Already registered as E245 and E246 (Cond.) in etc-06.

**Jude 1:7 and 2 Peter 2:6 -- Sodom as Example**
- Jude 1:7: "Even as Sodom and Gomorrha... are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
- 2 Pet 2:6: "turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly"
- Already registered as E202 (Neutral).

**Isaiah 66:24 -- Corpses, Worms, Unquenching Fire**
- Isa 66:24: "they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed... for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh."
- Subject = carcases (peger = dead bodies/corpses), not living persons. Already registered as E192 (Cond.).

**Psalm 37:20 -- Wicked Consume into Smoke**
- Ps 37:20: "the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away."
- Already registered as E217 (Cond.). Smoke = the END PRODUCT of consumption, not an ongoing state.

**Hosea 13:3 -- Smoke as Image of Vanishing**
- Hos 13:3: "they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff... and as the smoke out of the chimney."

- Isa 51:6: "the heavens shall vanish away like smoke... but my salvation shall be for ever"

#### Babylon Desolation Parallels

- Isa 13:19-20: "Babylon... shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited... from generation to generation"
- Jer 50:39-40: "it shall be no more inhabited for ever... As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah..."
- Rev 17:16: "shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire"
- Rev 18:8-9: "she shall be utterly burned with fire... shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning"
- Rev 18:18: "cried when they saw the smoke of her burning"
- Rev 19:2-3: "he hath judged the great whore... And her smoke rose up for ever and ever."

#### NT Support Passages
- Matt 25:41: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire"
- 2 Thess 1:9: "everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord"
- Rev 19:20: "the beast was taken... cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone"
- Rev 20:14-15: "death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
- Rev 21:8: "the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."

**Key lexical note on G372 anapausis ("no rest"):** Rev 4:8 uses this exact word for the living creatures who "rest not day and night" in ceaseless divine praise. Rev 14:11 uses it negatively for beast-worshippers who have "no rest day nor night." Same word, same book, same author. The research agent should investigate whether the anapausis parallel illuminates Rev 14:11 -- and whether "no rest" describes an eternal state or characterizes the judgment event as admitting no respite during its execution.

**Key lexical note on G929 basanismos ("torment"):** This noun appears 6 times, ALL in Revelation: Rev 9:5 (scorpion-sting torment -- 5 months, limited); Rev 14:11 (torment of beast-worshippers); Rev 18:7,10,15 (Babylon's torment = her judgment/destruction). In Rev 18, basanismos describes Babylon's judgment -- a clearly finite, completed destruction event. Same book, same context. The research agent should examine whether basanismos in Rev 18 illuminates its use in Rev 14:11.

**Key lexical note on G2303 theion ("brimstone"):** All 7 NT occurrences are in Luke-Revelation (Luke 17:29 -- Sodom; Rev 9:17,18; 14:10; 19:20; 20:10; 21:8). The only non-Revelation use (Luke 17:29) describes Sodom's destruction -- a completed, ended judgment. The OT brimstone (H1614 gophriyth) appears in Gen 19:24 (Sodom), Deut 29:23 (Sodom aftermath), Isa 34:9 (Edom), Job 18:15, Ps 11:6, Isa 30:33 (Tophet), Ezek 38:22. In every OT case, brimstone is an agent of destruction, not of ongoing torment.

### Focus Areas

Derived from tool discoveries, prior study findings, and the study question:

1. **The Isa 34:9-10 connection (primary OT source for both Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3):** What does Isa 34:9-17 actually describe? After the "smoke ascending for ever" and "not quenched night nor day" language (v.10), vv.11-17 describe animals dwelling in a permanently desolate landscape -- not ongoing combustion or conscious torment. The smoke-formula predicts permanent uninhabitable desolation, not perpetual burning. This is the OT source pattern and, via SIS (etc methodology #4a: shared vocabulary, identical idiom), governs the meaning of Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3.

2. **The Rev 19:3 structural argument (Babylon's smoke = same formula):** Rev 19:3 uses the identical "smoke rose up for ever and ever" for the fall of Babylon. Rev 18:8-18 describes "the smoke of her burning" -- already past, observed by onlookers. Rev 17:16-18:24 describes Babylon as destroyed/consumed/desolate. The same "smoke for ever" formula that some take as proof of ongoing conscious torment in Rev 14:11 is used in Rev 19:3 for an entity that is clearly permanently destroyed. This is same-author, same-book, same-formula evidence -- the strongest possible SIS connection.

3. **The Gen 19:24-28 connection (foundational type for fire-and-brimstone imagery):** Genesis 19 is the first biblical occurrence of fire and brimstone as divine judgment. The result: total destruction (Gen 19:25 "he overthrew those cities"), with Abraham observing ascending smoke (Gen 19:28). Sodom is set forth as an "example" (Jude 1:7) of "eternal fire" and as an "ensample" (2 Pet 2:6) of "turning into ashes." The fire-and-brimstone judgment pattern from its first occurrence means complete destruction.

4. **The Mal 4:1-3 connection (eschatological judgment as burning up):** Malachi uses oven/fire imagery for eschatological judgment. The wicked are "stubble" burned up, leaving "neither root nor branch" (4:1). They become "ashes under the soles of your feet" (4:3). This is an eschatological text using fire imagery for complete consumption, not ongoing torment.

5. **Tree 3 genre gate application (CRITICAL):** All primary passages (Rev 14:9-11; 19:3; 20:10) are in Revelation's apocalyptic framework. Tree 3 Gate 3 asks: "Is the passage didactic prose?" Automatic FAIL if apocalyptic vision. The research agent MUST apply Tree 3 to each Revelation passage and document Gate 1 (subject gate) and Gate 3 (genre gate) results. Prior studies have consistently documented these failures for Revelation passages (etc-05 E205; etc-08 E29-E32; etc-10 E1-E3). The genre gate does not make the passages irrelevant -- it means their positional classification must account for their genre.

6. **The subjects of Rev 14:9-11 vs. Rev 20:10:** Rev 14:9-11 warns about "any man" who worships the beast -- human beings. But they are within an apocalyptic vision, with symbolic entities (the beast, its image, its mark). Rev 20:10 describes the devil, the beast, and the false prophet -- the latter two are symbolic entities (E205). The subjects matter for Tree 3 Gate 1.

7. **The "no rest day nor night" phrase (Rev 14:11):** Same word (anapausis, G372) as Rev 4:8 where living creatures "rest not day and night" in praising God. Rev 14:13, two verses after 14:11, says the blessed dead "rest" (anapauomai, cognate of anapausis) from their labors. The contrast: beast-worshippers have "no rest"; the faithful dead DO rest. What does "no rest" mean -- an eternal conscious state, or the nature of the judgment event itself (no reprieve during execution)?

8. **G929 basanismos in Babylon context (Rev 18:7,10,15):** Basanismos appears 6 times total, all in Revelation. Three of those describe Babylon's "torment" -- but Babylon's "torment" is her destruction (Rev 18:8 "utterly burned with fire"; 18:17 "in one hour so great riches is come to nought"; 18:21 "thrown down, and shall be found no more at all"). If basanismos describes a completed destruction event for Babylon, it may carry the same meaning in Rev 14:11.

9. **The OT smoke vocabulary (H6227 ashan):** In the OT, smoke imagery is consistently associated with transience and consumption, not permanence: wicked consume into smoke (Ps 37:20, E217); smoke = transience/vanishing (Hos 13:3, E248; Isa 51:6); Sodom's smoke ascended as from a furnace (Gen 19:28 -- a completed event Abraham observed).

10. **ECT-side evidence (both sides required):** Rev 14:11 explicitly states "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" and "they have no rest day nor night." Rev 20:10 explicitly states torment "day and night for ever and ever" for the devil, beast, and false prophet. The "no rest" and "day and night" language, read on the surface, suggests ongoing conscious activity. The ECT reading has genuine force from the plain text of these passages when read in isolation from their OT source imagery. The research agent must give this surface reading its full evidential weight and document it honestly. The question is whether the OT source imagery, the Babylon parallel, the genre gate, and the subject gate modify or determine how this surface language should be read.

- Rev 19:3 -- hybrid-ot and hybrid-nt
- Gen 19:28 -- hybrid-ot and hybrid-nt
- Isa 34:10 -- hybrid-ot and hybrid-nt

**Hebrew/Greek parsing:**
- Run `hebrew_parser.py --verse "Isa 34:10"` -- parse the Hebrew of the smoke/for-ever clause
- Run `greek_parser.py --verse "REV 14:11"` -- parse the Greek; focus on verb form of "ascendeth" (anabainei? present indicative?) and the "eis aionas aionon" construction
- Run `greek_parser.py --verse "REV 19:3"` -- parse "smoke rose up for ever"
- Run `greek_parser.py --verse "REV 20:10"` -- parse "tormented day and night for ever and ever"

**Concept context:**
- Run `concept_context.py "REV 14:11"` -- find conceptually connected verses
- Run `concept_context.py "REV 14:10"` -- fire and brimstone connections

### Series context to note in research files:

**Established items bearing on this study:**
- E125 (Rev 20:10: devil, beast, false prophet tormented) -- Neutral
- E205 (beast/false prophet are symbolic entities) -- Neutral
- E245 (Mal 4:1: burn them up, neither root nor branch) -- Cond.
- E246 (Mal 4:3: ashes under soles of feet) -- Cond.
- E248 (Hos 13:3: smoke = transience) -- Cond.
- E254 (Rev 20:9: fire devoured human enemies) -- Neutral
- E265 (Rev 14:10-11: tormented with fire and brimstone; smoke ascends) -- Neutral
- E266 (Isa 34:10: identical smoke language; Edom not still burning) -- Neutral
- E282 (Edom's smoke goes up olam; animals inhabit) -- Cond.
- E293 (strongest "forever" form = Edom's ended judgment) -- Cond.
- E314 (ages of ages: ~19x for God, 3x judgment) -- Neutral
- E315 (Rev 14:11 echoes Isa 34:10) -- Neutral
- E316 (Rev 19:3 = symbolic Babylon) -- Neutral
- E349 (Revelation = VISION per Nave's) -- Neutral
- E350 (Rev 1:1 = signs/semainO) -- Neutral
- N035 (OT "forever" fire/smoke = completed judgments) -- Cond.
- N039 ("ages of ages" in judgment = same OT idiom) -- Cond.
- I045 (ages of ages teaches literal endless torment -- I-B ECT, resolved Strong) -- ECT-direction

**Items from etc-08 I-B Resolution for I045 (directly relevant):**
The etc-08 study resolved I045 ("Ages of ages" in Rev 14:11 and 20:10 teaches literal endless torment of all the wicked) as follows:
- FOR: Rev 20:10 surface reading (Ambiguous -- apocalyptic genre, non-human/symbolic subjects); Rev 14:11 surface reading (Ambiguous -- apocalyptic vision, echoes Isa 34:10)
- AGAINST: E315 (echoes Isa 34:10 -- Plain); E316 (Babylon is symbolic -- Plain); E125 (subjects non-human/symbolic -- Plain); E254 (devoured for humans -- Plain); N039 (OT pattern = completed judgment -- Plain); E205 (beast/false prophet symbolic -- Plain)
- Resolution: Strong toward Conditionalist reading. 6 Plain items vs 2 Ambiguous items.

The etc-11 study should deepen this analysis by examining the specific passages in detail, analyzing the fire-and-brimstone vocabulary chain from Gen 19 through Isa 34 to Revelation, the basanismos usage in Rev 18 (Babylon), the anapausis parallel in Rev 4:8, and the Mal 4:1-3 eschatological destruction imagery. It should NOT merely repeat the etc-08 I-B resolution but should build on it with fresh exegetical evidence.

### Methodology

Read `D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-series-methodology.md` for the full investigative methodology. Key points:
- Investigator, not advocate
- Gather evidence from ALL sides
- State what the text says, then what each interpretation infers
- Tree 3 must be applied to all Revelation E-items claiming positional classification
- I-B items require full 5-step SIS resolution
- All items must be registered in etc-master-evidence.md
