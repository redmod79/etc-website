# Bible Study: The Smoke Ascending Forever — Revelation 14:9-11, 19:3, and the Imagery of Eternal Torment

## Question

What does Revelation 14:9-11 mean when it says "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever"? What does Revelation 19:3 mean when it says Babylon's "smoke rose up for ever and ever"? What is the OT source of this imagery? Does "smoke ascending for ever" describe ongoing conscious torment, or does it describe the permanent/complete nature of the destruction? Are there OT examples where "smoke ascending for ever" describes destruction that is clearly finished?

**Note:** Nave's SMOKE entry is minimal (ISA 6:4; HOS 13:3 figurative only). The substantive scope for "smoke ascending for ever" is found through the PUNISHMENT ETERNAL sub-entry (which explicitly lists REV 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10) and through the BRIMSTONE, SODOM, and BABYLON topics. The key OT source text Isa 34:9-10 surfaces through the cross-testament parallel tool as the top match for both REV 14:11 (score 0.401) and REV 19:3 (score 0.330), with keyword match on "age, burn [continual, forever]" and "eternal_fire, forever."

### Verse References (from Nave's entries and tool output)

#### Primary NT Passages

**Rev 14:6-12 — The Three Angels and the Warning**

- Rev 14:10: "The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb"
- Rev 14:11: "And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name"
- Rev 14:12: "Here is the patience of the saints"
- Rev 14:13: "Blessed [are] the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours"

**Rev 19:1-4 — Hallelujah: Babylon's Smoke**

**Rev 20:10 — Devil, Beast, False Prophet**
- Rev 20:10: "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."

#### "No rest day nor night" comparisons (all within Revelation, same author)
- Rev 4:8: "the four beasts... they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy" [living creatures — ongoing divine praise]
- Rev 7:15: "serve him day and night in his temple" [the redeemed — ongoing divine service]
- Rev 14:11: "they have no rest day nor night" [beast-worshippers]
- Rev 20:10: "tormented day and night for ever and ever" [devil, beast, false prophet]

#### "For ever and ever" (eis aionas aionon) occurrences in Revelation (G165 aion)
- Rev 1:6; 4:9; 5:13; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 14:11; 15:3; 15:7; 19:3; 20:10; 22:5
- Note: Rev 11:15 ("he shall reign for ever and ever") and Rev 22:5 ("they shall reign for ever and ever") use the same phrase for divine/redeemed reign. Cross-testament tool confirms Rev 22:5 (score 0.325) and Rev 11:15 (score 0.285) as NT parallels to Rev 14:11.

#### OT Source Texts (critical — what Revelation draws from)

**Isaiah 34:9-17 — Edom's Smoke (primary source text)**
- Isa 34:9: "the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch"
- Isa 34:10: "It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever."
- Isa 34:11-17: Birds and wild animals possess the land; desolate forever; no humans there
- CRITICAL NOTE: Isa 34:10 is the TOP OT parallel for both Rev 14:11 (hybrid score 0.401) and Rev 19:3 (score 0.330) — confirmed by cross-testament tool. The PUNISHMENT ETERNAL sub-entry in Nave's explicitly cites "ISA 34:8-10" as the first OT reference for eternal punishment.

**Genesis 19:24-28 — Sodom's Smoke (foundational type)**
- Gen 19:24: "the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven"
- Gen 19:28: "And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah... and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
- Brimstone appears in the Nave's BRIMSTONE entry as the first reference: "Fire and, rained upon Sodom GEN 19:24; LUK 17:29"

**Jude 1:7 and 2 Peter 2:6 — Sodom as Example of "Eternal Fire"**
- Jude 1:7: "Even as Sodom and Gomorrha... are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
- 2 Pet 2:6: "And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly"
- ESTABLISHED: N029 (etc5-08): "eternal fire" = permanent result, not ongoing burning — Sodom's fire has been extinguished for millennia; the "eternal fire" destroyed them permanently.

**Isaiah 66:24 — Corpses, Worms, Unquenching Fire**
- Isa 66:24: "And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh."
- Note: Subject = carcases (dead bodies), not conscious living persons

**Psalm 37:20 — Smoke as Image of Consumption/Destruction**
- Ps 37:20: "But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD [shall be] as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away."
- H6227 (ashan) here; smoke = they are consumed, not that they persist in smoke

**Isaiah 51:6 — Smoke as Image of Vanishing**
- Isa 51:6: "for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke... but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished."

**Hosea 13:3 — Smoke as Image of Impermanence**
- Hos 13:3: "they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff... and as the smoke out of the chimney."
- Nave's SMOKE entry: Hos 13:3 is listed as figurative — smoke = transience/disappearing

#### Babylon Desolation Parallels (showing "eternal" destruction = uninhabited, not ongoing)
- Isa 13:19-20: "Babylon... shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited... from generation to generation"
- Jer 50:39-40: "it shall be no more inhabited for ever... As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah..."
- Jer 51:37: "Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant."
- Rev 17:16: "shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire"
- Rev 18:9: "shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning"
- Rev 18:18: "cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What [city is] like unto this great city!"
- Rev 19:2-3: "he hath judged the great whore... And her smoke rose up for ever and ever."
- NOTE: Rev 19:3 uses the IDENTICAL formula ("smoke rose up for ever and ever") for Babylon — a city that is clearly destroyed/desolate, not consciously burning forever. This is the strongest structural parallel within Revelation itself.

#### NT Support Passages
- Mat 25:41: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire" (G928 basanizo in verse 10 context; angels as executors)
- 2 Thes 1:9: "everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord" (NT parallels tool: score 0.331 for Rev 14:11)
- Rev 19:20: "And the beast was taken... These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone" (score 0.441 for Rev 14:11 NT parallels)

| H6227 | ashan (עָשָׁן) | masc. noun | Hebrew "smoke" — the OT smoke noun (Isa 34:10; Gen 19:28; Ps 37:20; Isa 51:6; Hos 13:3) | 25 total; LXX renders as G2586 kapnos (highest PMI) |

**Key lexical note on G372 anapausis ("no rest"):** Rev 4:8 uses this exact word for the living creatures who "rest not day and night" while ceaselessly praising God — positive, ongoing divine activity. Rev 14:11 uses it negatively: beast-worshippers have "no rest day nor night." The research agent should investigate whether the anapausis parallel (same word, same book, same author) in Rev 4:8 illuminates what "no rest" means in Rev 14:11 — or whether the contexts are too different to draw conclusions.

**Key lexical note on G929 basanismos ("torment"):** This noun appears 5 times in Revelation: Rev 9:5 (scorpion-sting torment — 5 months, limited); Rev 14:11 (torment of beast-worshippers); Rev 18:7,10,15 (Babylon's torment = her judgment/destruction). The research agent should examine whether basanismos in the Babylon context (18:7,10,15) — describing a clearly finite, completed event — illuminates its use in 14:11.

### Related Existing Studies (from semantic_studies.py)

The constraint for this series prohibits reference to non-etc5 studies. The semantic search confirmed that multiple prior-series studies addressed this exact topic (etc2-11, etc3-11, etc4-11, etc-11 all with the same title "The Smoke Ascending Forever — Revelation 14:9-11, 19:3, and the Imagery of Eternal Torment"). These are excluded per series constraint. No etc5 studies have yet addressed Rev 14:9-11 or Rev 19:3 as a dedicated investigation.

**Relevant etc5 context from CONCLUSION.md of etc5-10-souls-under-altar (2026-02-19):**

The immediately prior study (etc5-10) established critical SIS connections relevant to this study:

- **E149/E150** (Rev 14:10-11 and Rev 20:10 torment language) — Reclassified **Neutral** in an earlier etc5 study. Both the ECT reading (ongoing conscious torment) and the conditionalist reading (permanent nature of destruction) must account for these passages; the passages are not self-interpreting as to duration.
- **E182** (Isa 34:10 smoke ascending for ever) — Classified **Neutral**.
- **IB009** (Isa 34:10 smoke formula in Rev 14:11) — **Moderate toward permanent-desolation imagery**. This I-B item was resolved in a prior etc5 study: the smoke-ascending-for-ever formula in Rev 14:11 draws on Isa 34:10's Edom imagery, which describes a desolate landscape (animals dwelling there, no humans), not ongoing conscious suffering.
- **N029** (from etc5-08): "eternal fire = permanent result, not ongoing burning" — The Sodom precedent (Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6) shows that "eternal fire" destroyed Sodom permanently; the fire itself is extinguished. N029 is established in this series.
- The anapauō (G373/G372) connection: Rev 14:13 uses the same verb form (anapausōntai) as Rev 6:11, and Rev 14:11's "no rest" (anapausis) is from the same root. etc5-10 established E242 (conditionalist) on this connection.

### Focus Areas

Derived from tool discoveries (cross-testament parallels, Strong's data, Nave's entries, verse text):

1. **The Isa 34:10 connection (confirmed by tool as #1 OT parallel for both Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3):** What does Isa 34:9-17 actually describe? After the "smoke ascending for ever" is announced (v.10), what does the rest of the passage say? Verses 11-17 describe animals dwelling in a permanently desolate landscape — not ongoing conscious torment. The smoke-formula predicts permanent desolation, not perpetual burning. This is the OT source pattern and governs the meaning of Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3.

2. **The Rev 19:3 structural argument (Babylon's smoke = same formula):** Revelation 19:3 uses the identical language ("smoke rose up for ever and ever") for the fall of Babylon. Rev 18:9,18 describe "the smoke of her burning" — already past. Rev 17:16-18:24 describes Babylon as destroyed/consumed. The same "smoke for ever" formula that some take as proof of ongoing conscious torment in Rev 14:11 is used in Rev 19:3 for a city that is clearly permanently destroyed, not perpetually burning. This internal Revelation evidence must be addressed.

3. **The subjects of Rev 14:9-11 (human beast-worshippers vs. the supernatural trio in Rev 20:10):** Rev 14:9-11 describes "any man" who worships the beast — human beings. Rev 20:10 describes the devil, the beast, and the false prophet — which may include supernatural entities (cf. IB009 already established on this distinction). The research agent should investigate whether the subjects matter for interpretation.

4. **The timing phrase "in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb" (Rev 14:10):** This phrase locates the torment at a specific event — possibly the judgment itself rather than a state of ongoing duration. The cross-testament NT parallel tool identifies this verse's context as involving angels and judgment (scores: Dan 6:23; 5:23; REV 8:4; Mat 25:41). The research agent should investigate what "in the presence of" signifies temporally.

5. **G372 anapausis ("no rest") in context:** Rev 4:8 uses the same noun (anapausis) for the living creatures who "rest not day and night" in ongoing worship before God. This is a positive ongoing activity. Rev 14:11 uses it negatively. The research agent should investigate whether "no rest day nor night" is best understood as (a) ongoing conscious suffering forever, or (b) a characterization of the judgment/destruction event that admits no respite or reprieve during its execution.

6. **G929 basanismos ("torment") in Babylon context (Rev 18:7,10,15):** The noun basanismos appears in Rev 18:7 ("give her... torment and sorrow"), Rev 18:10 ("the hour of her judgment is come"), and Rev 18:15 ("stand afar off for the fear of her torment") — all describing Babylon's judgment/destruction. These are contexts where "torment" clearly describes a judicial destruction event, not ongoing conscious suffering in eternity. The research agent should examine whether basanismos in Rev 18 — same book, same context — illuminates its use in Rev 14:11.

7. **The LXX connection (H6227 ashan → G2586 kapnos):** The LXX renders Hebrew ashan (smoke, H6227) as Greek kapnos (G2586) with highest PMI (score 30.28, count 20). This confirms that the Revelation author(s), drawing on LXX-influenced Greek, were using kapnos to translate the OT Hebrew imagery of smoke (including Isa 34:10's ashan). The research agent should verify the Isa 34:10 Hebrew and its LXX rendering.

8. **H5769 olam (for ever) and its semantic range:** H5769 appears in Isa 34:10 twice ("smoke thereof shall go up for ever"; "none shall pass through it for ever and ever"). The lexical definition: "properly, concealed, i.e. the vanishing point; generally, time out of mind." The same word describes: Sodom's desolation (Jer 49:18; 50:5; Isa 13:19-20); Babylon's desolation (Jer 51:26,39,57,62). The research agent should examine whether olam in Isa 34:10 carries an "ongoing" meaning or a "permanent/complete" meaning given what follows (vv.11-17: animals in desolate land).

9. **The "eternal punishment" Nave's sub-entry cross-references:** The Nave's PUNISHMENT entry lists ISA 34:8-10 as the first OT citation under "ETERNAL" punishment, alongside MAT 25:41,46; REV 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10. This confirms Nave's itself categorizes Isa 34:8-10 as an "eternal punishment" passage — which is itself evidence that IB009 (moderate toward permanent-desolation) must grapple with: what kind of "eternal" punishment does Isa 34:8-10 describe?

10. **ECT-side evidence (both sides required):** Rev 14:11 explicitly states "smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever." Rev 20:10 explicitly states torment "day and night for ever and ever" for the devil, beast, and false prophet. The "no rest day nor night" language, if taken with a literal "for ever and ever," requires the research agent to give this its full evidential weight. The ECT reading has genuine force from the plain text. The I-B question (IB009 and any new I-B items) must address whether Rev 14:11 taken alone supports the ECT reading, and whether the OT parallels and the Babylon parallel (Rev 19:3) adequately counter or only qualify that reading.
