## 1. G2586 καπνός (kapnos) — Smoke

**Original:** καπνός
**Transliteration:** kapnós
**Pronunciation:** kap-nos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** of uncertain affinity; smoke:—smoke.

### NT Distribution (13 total occurrences)

**ALL NT uses of G2586:**
1. Acts 2:19 — "And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke" (quoting Joel 2:30/3:3)
2. Revelation 8:4 — "And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand."
3. Revelation 9:2 — "And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit."
4. Revelation 9:3 — "And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth" (implied G2586)
5. Revelation 9:17 — "...out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone."
6. Revelation 9:18 — "By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone"

10. Revelation 18:18 — "And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning"
11. Revelation 19:3 — "And her smoke rose up for ever and ever."

**DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS:**
- Acts 2:19 (Joel quotation): 1 occurrence
- Revelation: 10+ occurrences
- All remaining NT uses are in Revelation alone

G2586 is almost exclusively a Revelation word in the NT. Outside Revelation, it appears only in Acts 2:19 as a Joel quotation. This confirms that "smoke" (kapnos) as eschatological/judgment imagery is specifically Johannine/Revelation vocabulary.

### Distribution within Revelation:

| Reference | Context | Use |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| 8:4 | Incense/prayers ascending before God | Positive/theophanic |
| 9:2 (×2) | Smoke from bottomless pit | Demonic darkness |
| 9:17,18 | Fire/smoke/brimstone from horses | Death-dealing judgment |
| 14:11 | Smoke of torment, beast-worshippers | Judgment formula |
| 15:8 | Temple filled with smoke from God's glory | Theophanic/divine presence |
| 18:9 | Smoke of Babylon's burning | Destruction/fall |
| 18:18 | Smoke of Babylon's burning (second mention) | Destruction/fall |
| 19:3 | Smoke of Babylon ascending forever | Permanent destruction formula |

**PATTERN:** G2586 kapnos in Revelation appears in three categories: (1) divine presence/theophanic (8:4; 15:8), (2) deadly judgment weapons (9:17,18), and (3) destruction/desolation imagery (14:11; 18:9; 18:18; 19:3). The two "smoke ascending forever" passages (14:11 and 19:3) share category 3 with the Babylon "smoke of her burning" (18:9,18) — which is clearly a destruction event, not ongoing torment.

### LXX Connection (H6227 → G2586):
The Hebrew ashan (H6227) is translated by the LXX as kapnos (G2586) with highest PMI score (30.28, count 20). This confirms that John's use of kapnos in Rev 14:11 and 19:3 consciously draws on the Hebrew ashan tradition — including Isa 34:10 ("ashan ascending for ever") and Gen 19:28 ("smoke of a furnace").

## 2. G929 βασανισμός (basanismos) — Torment (Noun)

**Original:** βασανισμός
**Transliteration:** basanismós
**Pronunciation:** bas-an-is-mos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** from G928 basanizō; torture:—torment.

### ALL Occurrences (5 distinct references; 6 total uses)

1. **Revelation 9:5** — "And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented (basanisthōsin) five months: and their torment (basanismos) [was] as the torment (basanismos) of a scorpion, when he striketh a man." — TWO USES (two instances of basanismos in this verse)
2. **Revelation 14:11** — "And the smoke of their torment (basanismou) ascendeth up for ever and ever"
3. **Revelation 18:7** — "How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment (basanismon) and sorrow give her"
4. **Revelation 18:10** — "Standing afar off for the fear of her torment (basanismou), saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come."
5. **Revelation 18:15** — "The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment (basanismou), weeping and wailing"

**CRITICAL OBSERVATION — ALL IN REVELATION, NEVER OUTSIDE:**

G929 basanismos (torment noun) appears ONLY in Revelation in the entire NT. It never occurs in the Gospels, Acts, Paul's letters, Hebrews, or any other NT book. This makes the internal Revelation context decisive for its meaning.

### Analysis of Uses:

**Rev 9:5 (twice — limited 5-month torment):**
The scorpion torment of the fifth trumpet is explicitly limited: "five months" (v.5,10). It is not permanent or eternal. This use of basanismos establishes that the word can describe LIMITED, FINITE torment within Revelation itself.

**Rev 18:7, 18:10, 18:15 (three times — Babylon's torment):**
All three uses describe Babylon's judgment. Babylon is a city (system). Her "torment" is:
- 18:7: deserved punishment given in equal measure to her pride
- 18:10: "for in one hour is thy judgment come" — the torment = the judgment event, which lasts "one hour"
- 18:15: the fear of her torment — the judgment is visible (smoke of burning, 18:9,18) and is clearly past/completed

The Babylon uses of basanismos consistently describe a COMPLETED JUDGMENT EVENT, not ongoing eternal torment. The torment IS the judgment, which is described as sudden ("one hour"), thorough, and final.

**Rev 14:11 (once — beast-worshippers):**
"The smoke of their torment (basanismos) ascendeth up for ever and ever."

**Key insight from the distribution:**
G929 basanismos occurs in Revelation ONLY. Three of its five uses (18:7,10,15) describe Babylon's completed judicial destruction. One (9:5) describes a limited 5-month torment. Only one (14:11) is the contested passage. The three Babylon uses of the exact same noun in the exact same book demonstrate that basanismos in Revelation CAN and DOES describe completed/finite judgment events. The smoke ascending for ever (19:3) immediately follows these Babylon-basanismos references.

## 3. G928 βασανίζω (basanizō) — To Torment (Verb)

**Original:** βασανίζω
**Transliteration:** basanízō
**Pronunciation:** bas-an-id-zo
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** from G931 basanos (a touchstone); to torture:—pain, toil, torment, toss, vex.

| **Revelation 20:10** | "shall be tormented" | Devil, beast, false prophet | **Judgment torment — Fut Pass Ind 3P** |

**Observations:**
1. The verb G928 has broad semantic range: physical pain (Mat 8:6), being tossed/strained (Mat 14:24; Mk 6:48), psychological distress (2 Pet 2:8), birth pangs (Rev 12:2), supernatural fear of judgment (Mat 8:29; Mk 5:7; Lk 8:28), prophetic witness (Rev 11:10), limited scorpion torment (Rev 9:5), and judicial torment (Rev 14:10; 20:10).
2. The word does NOT inherently require ongoing conscious torment — it covers a wide range from "tossed" (boat) to "vexed" (Lot) to "pained" (birth) to "tormented" (judgment).
3. The judicial uses (Rev 14:10; 20:10) are both Future Passive — the torment is something done TO the subjects, not something they do.

## 4. G372 ἀνάπαυσις (anapausis) — Rest (Noun)

**Original:** ἀνάπαυσις
**Transliteration:** anápausis
**Pronunciation:** an-ap-ow-sis
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** from G373 anapaūō; intermission; by implication, recreation:—rest.

### ALL Occurrences (5-6 total)

| Reference | Context | Positive/Negative |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Matthew 11:29 | "rest unto your souls" — Christ's yoke giving rest | Positive |
| Matthew 12:43 | "he walketh through dry places, seeking rest" — unclean spirit wandering | Negative (absence of rest = restlessness) |
| Luke 11:24 | "seeking rest" — unclean spirit | Negative (absence of rest = wandering) |
| Philemon 1:7 | "[hearts] refreshed/rested" — Paul to Philemon | Positive |
| **Revelation 4:8** | **"they rest not (anapausin ouk ekhousin) day and night"** — living creatures | **Positive: unceasing worship** |
| **Revelation 14:11** | **"they have no rest (anapausin ouk ekhousin) day nor night"** — beast-worshippers | **Negative: no respite in judgment** |

### CRITICAL COMPARISON — Rev 4:8 vs. Rev 14:11

**Grammatical structure (IDENTICAL):**
- Rev 4:8: ἀνάπαυσιν οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς
- Rev 14:11: οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἀνάπαυσιν ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός

Both use: G372 (ἀνάπαυσιν) + G3756 (οὐκ) + G2192 (ἔχουσιν) + G2250/G3571 (ἡμέρας/νυκτός in genitive of time)

**The parallel establishes the meaning of "no rest":**
- In Rev 4:8, the living creatures have "no rest" because they are CONTINUALLY WORSHIPPING. Their "no rest" = their unceasing positive activity of praise.
- In Rev 14:11, the beast-worshippers have "no rest" — this parallels the living creatures' construction but in a negative/judgment key.

**What the parallel tells us:** "No rest day and night" in Revelation describes unceasing activity or state. For the living creatures, it is positive unceasing worship. For the beast-worshippers, it is negative unceasing judgment/torment. The phrase does not in itself resolve the duration question (is it truly endless?), but it establishes that the phrase describes something without pause or intermission.

**Contrast with Rev 14:13:** The very next verse after "no rest day nor night" (v.11) announces: "they may rest (anapausōntai — G373 verb form) from their labours." The dead in Christ will rest. The beast-worshippers will not. The contrast is deliberate and lexically close.

## 5. G373 ἀναπαύω (anapaūō) — To Rest (Verb)

**Original:** ἀναπαύω
**Transliteration:** anapaúō
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** from G303 + G3973; to repose (literally or figuratively [be exempt], remain); to refresh:—give rest, (give, take) rest(-ful, -ing).

### Key Revelation Uses

| Reference | Context |
|-----------|---------|
| Rev 6:11 | "that they should rest (anapausōntai) yet for a little season" — souls under altar |
| Rev 14:13 | "that they may rest (anapausōntai) from their labours" — blessed dead in Christ |

**NOTE:** Rev 6:11 and Rev 14:13 both use the same aorist passive subjunctive form (anapausōntai). This is the verb form established as E242 (conditionalist) in etc5-10: souls under altar rest, and the blessed dead rest. The martyrs/righteous dead receive anapausis (rest); the beast-worshippers do not. This is the sharp antithesis within Revelation itself.

## 6. G2303 θεῖον (theion) — Brimstone/Sulfur

**Original:** θεῖον
**Transliteration:** theîon
**Pronunciation:** thi-on
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Definition:** probably neuter of G2304 (in its original sense of flashing); sulphur:—brimstone.

### ALL Occurrences (7 total)

| Reference | Context |
|-----------|---------|
| Genesis 19:24 (LXX) | "brimstone and fire" rained on Sodom |
| Psalms 11:6 (LXX) | "fire and brimstone" God's portion for the wicked |
| Ezekiel 38:22 (LXX) | "fire and brimstone" rained on Gog |
| Luke 17:29 | "it rained fire and brimstone from heaven" on Sodom |
| Revelation 9:17 | horses: fire and smoke and brimstone |
| Revelation 14:10 | tormented "with fire and brimstone" |
| Revelation 19:20 | lake of fire burning with brimstone |
| Revelation 20:10 | lake of fire and brimstone |
| Revelation 21:8 | lake which burneth with fire and brimstone = second death |

**PATTERN:** G2303 theion (brimstone) is consistently used in judgment-of-Sodom and judgment-of-nations contexts. The LXX maps H1614 (gophrith) → G2303 (theion) with perfect 1:1 correspondence (PMI 11.01, score 22.89). All NT uses are either Sodom references (Lk 17:29) or Revelation judgment passages. In Revelation, fire and brimstone consistently appear in the context of the lake of fire — the final judgment locale.

**The fire-and-brimstone → smoke connection:**
- Gen 19:24: fire and brimstone on Sodom → Gen 19:28: smoke as smoke of furnace
- Isa 34:9: brimstone on Edom → Isa 34:10: smoke ascending for ever
- Rev 14:10: fire and brimstone on beast-worshippers → Rev 14:11: smoke of their torment ascending for ever

The brimstone (G2303) is consistently the precursor to smoke (G2586) in the pattern. Fire and brimstone produce smoke. The smoke is the visible residue of what the fire and brimstone have done.

## 7. H6227 עָשָׁן (ashan) — Smoke (Hebrew)

**Original:** עָשָׁן
**Transliteration:** ʻâshân
**Pronunciation:** aw-shawn
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Definition:** from H6226; smoke, literally or figuratively (vapor, dust, anger):—smoke(-ing).

### KEY OT Occurrences (25 total in Hebrew Bible)

**Foundational smoke passages:**
- Genesis 15:17: "a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces" — Abrahamic covenant smoke
- Exodus 19:16-18: Mount Sinai smoke (theophanic — smoke of God's presence)
- Genesis 19:28 (twice): "the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace" — Sodom aftermath
- Joshua 8:20-21: Smoke of Ai burning — military destruction visible from afar

**Smoke as transience/impermanence:**
- Psalm 37:20: "into smoke shall they consume away" — the wicked perish into smoke
- Psalm 68:3: "As smoke is driven away, so drive them away" — smoke = dispersal
- Psalm 102:4: "My days are consumed like smoke" — days disappearing
- Isaiah 51:6: "the heavens shall vanish away like smoke" — dissolution

**The key prophetic passage:**
- **Isaiah 34:10 (twice):** "the smoke thereof (ashanah) shall go up for ever" — H6227 appears twice in the "smoke ascending for ever" declaration about Edom
- Isaiah 65:5: "a fire that burneth all the day" — smoke context
- Hosea 13:3: "as the smoke out of the chimney" — transience

### LXX Mapping

H6227 (ashan) → G2586 (kapnos): count 20, PMI 9.95, score 30.28 — dominant primary mapping

**Significance:** When the LXX translators encountered H6227 (ashan) in OT texts, they rendered it G2586 (kapnos) in 20 of their uses. This means:
- Isa 34:10's "ashan go up for ever" → LXX reads "kapnos anabainei eis aionas"
- Rev 14:11's "kapnos anabainei eis aionas aionon" deliberately mirrors the LXX of Isa 34:10
- John (or the Revelation author) is consciously using the LXX Isa 34:10 formula

The chain: Hebrew ashan (Isa 34:10) → LXX kapnos → Revelation kapnos (14:11; 19:3). The Greek vocabulary of the smoke-ascending formula in Revelation IS the LXX translation of the Edom-smoke-ascending formula.

### Semantic range of H6227 in OT smoke imagery:

All OT smoke imagery using H6227 functions in one of these ways:
1. **Theophanic smoke:** God's presence (Exod 19:16-18; Gen 15:17; Isa 6:4)
2. **Destruction aftermath:** Smoke seen after fire has consumed (Gen 19:28; Josh 8:20-21)
3. **Symbol of transience:** Smoke that disappears (Ps 37:20; 68:3; 102:4; Isa 51:6; Hos 13:3)
4. **Judgment imagery:** Smoke as evidence of divine judgment (Isa 34:10; Isa 65:5)

NO OT use of H6227 describes smoke as a sign of ONGOING PERPETUAL BURNING with ongoing conscious suffering. The smoke of Sodom's aftermath (Gen 19:28) was visible the next morning but the cities were already ash. The smoke of Edom (Isa 34:10) goes up "for ever" but the land becomes desolate and empty afterward (vv.11-17).

### Distribution Analysis

| Category | Count | References |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| God/Christ's eternal existence | 9 | 1:6, 1:18, 4:9, 4:10, 5:13, 5:14, 7:12, 10:6, 15:7 |
| Christ's eternal reign | 1 | 11:15 |
| Saints' eternal reign | 1 | 22:5 |
| Judgment (smoke/torment) | 3 | 14:11, 19:3, 20:10 |

**Analysis:**
- 11 of 14 uses apply the formula to God, Christ, or the redeemed — eternal life, eternal existence, eternal reign
- 3 of 14 uses apply the formula to judgment — smoke of torment (14:11), Babylon's smoke (19:3), devil's torment (20:10)

**The key tension for the analysis agent:**
1. If "for ever and ever" genuinely means endless duration when applied to God's existence (Rev 4:9), it must carry the same meaning when applied to torment (Rev 20:10). The parallelism suggests equal force.
2. However, Rev 19:3 (Babylon's smoke for ever) demonstrates within Revelation that the formula applies to COMPLETED DESTRUCTION of a non-person entity (a city/system). If Babylon's smoke can "rise for ever and ever" after a one-hour destruction, then the formula can describe the permanent, irreversible character of destruction rather than endless ongoing burning.
3. The Isa 34:10 OT background (confirmed as #1 OT parallel for both Rev 14:11 and 19:3) shows the formula applied to a desolate landscape that animals inhabit afterward — not a perpetually burning scene.

**G165 aion semantic range:** The basic definition is "an age" — a defined period of time — with "perpetuity" as an extended meaning. The plural-of-plural construction (ages of ages) is a Hebrew superlative: the greatest possible age, the ultimate duration. In contexts of God's existence, this expresses genuine endless duration. In contexts of judgment consequences, it expresses the permanent, irreversible, and age-spanning finality of the judgment.

## 9. H5769 עוֹלָם (olam) — For Ever (Hebrew)

**Transliteration:** ʻôwlâm
**Definition:** properly, concealed, i.e. the vanishing point; generally, time out of mind (past or future), i.e. (practically) eternity; frequentatively, adverbial always

**Root meaning (from H5956):** "to conceal, veil, be hidden" — "the vanishing point," the place beyond which one cannot see. This is the etymology of the word: it refers to the horizon of time where things disappear from view.

### H5769 in desolation/judgment contexts relevant to this study:

| Reference | Context | Use of H5769 |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Isaiah 34:10 (twice) | Edom's smoke / none passes through | "smoke go up for ever (leolam)" / "none shall pass through for ever and ever (leolam vaed)" |
| Isaiah 34:17 | Animals possess Edom | "they shall possess it for ever (leolam)" |
| Isaiah 13:20 | Babylon never inhabited | "It shall never (leolam) be inhabited" |
| Jeremiah 50:39 | Babylon no more inhabited | "no more inhabited for ever (leolam)" |
| Jeremiah 51:26 | No stone from Babylon for a corner | "for thou shalt be desolate for ever (leolam)" |
| Jeremiah 51:62 | Babylon desolate for ever | "shalt be desolate for ever (leolam)" |

**Contrast uses (H5769 of God's eternal existence):**
- Psalm 90:2: "from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God" — genuine eternal existence
- Deuteronomy 33:27: "The eternal God is thy refuge"

**Key observation:** H5769 applies to BOTH God's genuine eternal existence AND the permanent desolation of destroyed cities/lands. The word does not automatically mean "endless ongoing duration" — in desolation contexts, it means "permanent, irrevocable, from this age forward." Babylon's being "never inhabited for ever" (H5769) does not mean Babylon is consciously experiencing perpetual uninhabitedness — it means Babylon has been permanently ruined.

Applied to Isa 34:10: "the smoke thereof shall go up for ever (leolam)" — this is a declaration that Edom's destruction is permanent and irreversible. The smoke that ascends is the visible evidence of a permanent destruction. After v.10, vv.11-17 describe the desolate landscape where animals now dwell — confirming the "for ever" describes permanent desolation, not perpetual burning.
