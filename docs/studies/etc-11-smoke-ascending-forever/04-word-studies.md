### Distribution Analysis
- ALL 13 occurrences are in either Acts (1, quoting Joel) or Revelation (12)
- In Revelation, smoke appears in: theophany/divine presence (8:4; 15:8), judgment/destruction (9:2,17,18; 14:11; 18:9,18; 19:3), and one purely descriptive occurrence
- Rev 18:9 and 18:18 describe the SMOKE OF BABYLON'S BURNING -- a completed destruction event observed by onlookers
- Rev 19:3 uses the same kapnos for Babylon's "smoke" ascending "for ever and ever"
- The Babylon usage (18:9,18; 19:3) provides same-book, same-author context for interpreting 14:11

### OT Background (H6227 ashan)
The Hebrew equivalent (ashan) is used in OT for:
- Sodom's smoke ascending (Gen 19:28)
- Theophany smoke (Exo 19:18; Isa 6:4)
- Wicked consuming into smoke (Ps 37:20)

**Transliteration:** basanismos
**Pronunciation:** bas-an-is-mos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**Definition:** torture, torment (from basanizo)
**Total Occurrences:** 6 (BLB count)

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| torment | 5 | 83.3% |
| the torment | 1 | 16.7% |

### Key Verses (ALL 6 occurrences -- ALL in Revelation)
1. **Rev 9:5** -- "their torment [was] as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man" (5 months duration -- limited, temporary)
2. **Rev 14:11** -- "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever"
3. **Rev 18:7** -- "so much torment and sorrow give her" (Babylon)
4. **Rev 18:10** -- "Standing afar off for the fear of her torment" (Babylon)
5. **Rev 18:15** -- "shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment" (Babylon)

### Distribution Analysis -- CRITICAL
- ALL 6 occurrences are in Revelation
- 3 of 6 describe BABYLON'S "torment" (Rev 18:7,10,15)
- Babylon's "torment" IS her destruction: "utterly burned with fire" (18:8), "in one hour" (18:10,17), "thrown down, and shall be found no more at all" (18:21)
- Rev 9:5: the only occurrence with an explicit time limit (5 months) -- showing basanismos CAN describe a limited, temporary experience
- Same book, same author uses basanismos for a completed destruction event (Babylon) and a temporally limited event (scorpion torment)

- NOT limited to "eternal conscious torment" -- the word describes any form of distress, affliction, or testing
- In Rev 14:10, the verb is used in context of fire and brimstone -- the OT fire-and-brimstone pattern is destruction
- In Rev 20:10, the subjects are devil, beast, and false prophet (beast/false prophet are symbolic entities)

## G372 -- anapausis (rest/cessation)

**Original:** anapausis
**Transliteration:** anapausis
**Pronunciation:** an-ap-ow-sis
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**Definition:** intermission, recreation, rest (from anapauo)
**Total Occurrences:** 5 (BLB count)

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| rest | 4 | 80.0% |
| they rest | 1 | 20.0% |

### ALL 5 Occurrences
1. **Matt 11:29** -- "ye shall find rest unto your souls" (spiritual rest)
2. **Matt 12:43** -- "walketh through dry places, seeking rest" (unclean spirit seeking rest)
3. **Luke 11:24** -- "walketh through dry places, seeking rest" (parallel to Matt 12:43)
4. **Rev 4:8** -- "they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy" (living creatures in ceaseless praise)
5. **Rev 14:11** -- "they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast"

### Critical Comparison: Rev 4:8 vs. Rev 14:11
- SAME word (anapausis)
- SAME book (Revelation)
- SAME author (John)
- SAME phrase structure ("rest not / no rest day nor night")
- Rev 4:8: living creatures "rest not day and night" = characterizes the continuous nature of their praise DURING its duration
- Rev 14:11: beast-worshippers have "no rest day nor night" = ?
- The Rev 4:8 usage demonstrates that "no rest day and night" can describe the uninterrupted nature of an activity during its execution, without necessarily specifying duration

### Cognate: anapauomai (G373)
- Rev 14:13: "that they may REST from their labours" -- cognate of anapausis
- Direct contrast within same passage: beast-worshippers have "no rest" (14:11); faithful dead DO "rest" (14:13)

## G2303 -- theion (brimstone)

**Original:** theion
**Transliteration:** theion
**Pronunciation:** thi-on
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun
**Definition:** sulphur (probably from theios = divine; original sense "flashing")
**Total Occurrences:** 7 (BLB count)

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| brimstone | 7 | 100% |

### ALL 7 Occurrences
1. **Luke 17:29** -- "it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all" (Sodom)
2. **Rev 9:17** -- "out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone"
3. **Rev 9:18** -- "by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone"
4. **Rev 14:10** -- "tormented with fire and brimstone"
5. **Rev 19:20** -- "cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone"
6. **Rev 20:10** -- "cast into the lake of fire and brimstone"
7. **Rev 21:8** -- "the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death"

### Distribution Analysis
- Only non-Revelation use: Luke 17:29 -- Sodom. Jesus says it "destroyed them all."
- All Revelation uses are in apocalyptic vision contexts
- Rev 21:8 defines the fire-and-brimstone lake as "the second death" -- death terminology

### OT Background (H1614 gophriyth)
- Gen 19:24: Sodom destroyed with brimstone and fire
- Deut 29:23: aftermath description -- "brimstone, and salt, and burning" = desolate landscape
- Job 18:15: "brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation" (destruction of the wicked's dwelling)
- Ps 11:6: "fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest" = "portion of their cup"
- Isa 30:33: Tophet with "fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it"
- Isa 34:9: Edom's "dust thereof into brimstone"
- Ezek 38:22: "fire, and brimstone" upon Gog

In every OT case, brimstone is an agent of destruction and desolation, not of ongoing torment.

## G305 -- anabaino (ascend/go up)

**Original:** anabaino
**Transliteration:** anabaino
**Pronunciation:** an-ab-ah-ee-no
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** to go up (literally or figuratively)
**Total Occurrences:** 82 (BLB count); 65 in KJV translation data

### Key Uses in Revelation
- **Rev 8:4** -- smoke of incense "ascended up before God"
- **Rev 9:2** -- smoke of the pit "arose" (same verb)
- **Rev 11:7** -- beast "ascend out of the bottomless pit"
- **Rev 11:12** -- two witnesses "ascended up to heaven"
- **Rev 14:11** -- "smoke of their torment ascendeth up" (present tense)

### Usage in Rev 14:11
In Rev 14:11, the verb is in the present tense (anabainei), describing the smoke as "ascending up." The present tense in Greek can describe ongoing action OR characteristic action (gnomic present). The same verb describes smoke ascending from incense (8:4) and from a pit (9:2) -- neither of which requires an eternal, unending process.

In OT usage, smoke (ashan) consistently carries connotations of:

2. Completed destruction (aftermath observed)
3. Transience and vanishing (the wicked dissipate like smoke)
4. Never used for "ongoing conscious suffering" or "eternal torment"

## H1614 -- gophriyth (brimstone)

**Original:** gophriyth
**Transliteration:** gophriyth
**Pronunciation:** gof-reeth
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**Definition:** properly, cypress-resin; by analogy, sulphur (as equally inflammable)
**Total Occurrences:** 7 (BLB count)

### Translations
| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| brimstone | 3 | 42.9% |
| and brimstone | 2 | 28.6% |
| of brimstone | 1 | 14.3% |
| into brimstone | 1 | 14.3% |

### ALL 7 Occurrences
1. **Gen 19:24** -- "the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire" (Sodom destroyed)
2. **Deut 29:23** -- "the whole land thereof [is] brimstone, and salt, and burning" (desolate aftermath)
3. **Job 18:15** -- "brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation" (destruction of the wicked's place)
4. **Ps 11:6** -- "Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone" (judgment echoing Sodom)
5. **Isa 30:33** -- "the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it" (Tophet)
6. **Isa 34:9** -- "the dust thereof into brimstone" (Edom's judgment)
7. **Ezek 38:22** -- "fire, and brimstone" upon Gog (eschatological judgment)

### Usage Pattern
In every OT occurrence, gophriyth (brimstone) functions as an agent of destructive judgment. The result is always destruction and desolation -- never ongoing conscious torment. The aftermath descriptions (Deut 29:23; Isa 34:11-17) consistently describe desolate, uninhabited landscapes, not perpetual burning.
