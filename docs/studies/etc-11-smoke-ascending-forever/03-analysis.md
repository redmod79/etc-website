# Analysis — etc5-11: The Smoke Ascending Forever

## Series Context

This is study 11 of 18 in the ETC5 series "The Final Fate of the Wicked." The central question: what does "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" (Rev 14:11) mean? Does it describe ongoing conscious torment without end, or does it describe the permanent, irreversible character of the destruction? The same formula appears in Rev 19:3 applied to Babylon.

## Section 1: Revelation's Apocalyptic Genre and the Esemanen Principle

Revelation opens with a programmatic self-description: "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and **signified** [esēmainō, G4591, Aorist Active Indicative] it by his angel unto his servant John" (Rev 1:1).

E231 (established in etc5-10) confirms: the verb esēmainō means "to indicate by sign, to communicate through sign-imagery." Revelation declares its own communicative mode: it conveys truth through signs. This is not an external critical judgment imposed on the book — it is the book's self-identification.

The practical consequence for interpretation is significant. When Revelation deploys imagery drawn from the OT prophetic tradition (fire, smoke, brimstone, the eternal burning of Edom's land), that imagery communicates theological truth through symbolic representation. The question is not whether the imagery is "real" — Revelation's judgments are real — but whether the imagery's surface description is the complete literal description, or whether it is sign-language pointing to realities that the OT source context illuminates.

This principle has been consistently applied across the series: E232 (Rev 6:8, Death and Hades as horsemen — personification), E233 (Rev 16:7, altar speaks — non-conscious entity attributed speech), N039 (Revelation's genre depicts non-conscious entities speaking). The IB013 Strong resolution established that the same literary mode governs Rev 6:9-11 (souls crying = blood-testimony convention, not literal consciousness). The same interpretive framework must be applied consistently when examining the smoke imagery of Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3.

## Section 2: Revelation 14:6-12 — Full Context of the Third Angel

The third angel's proclamation (Rev 14:9-11) does not stand alone. It is the third in a sequence of three angel messages forming a structural unit:

**First angel (vv.6-7):** Eternal gospel; hour of judgment come; worship the Creator.

**Second angel (v.8):** "Babylon is fallen, is fallen." This proleptic announcement declares Babylon's fall as certain — a present-tense announcement of an event developed in Rev 17-18. The second angel frames what follows as part of the Babylon-judgment complex.

**Third angel (vv.9-11):** Warning against worshipping the beast and receiving the mark.

**Verse 12:** "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

**Verse 13:** "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest [anapausōntai, G373] from their labours; and their works do follow them."

The rhetorical purpose of the third angel's warning is to contrast two fates: (a) beast-worshippers receiving the wine of God's wrath with fire, brimstone, and smoke ascending for ever, and (b) those who die in the Lord receiving rest and having their works follow them.

The subjects of vv.9-11 are specifically defined: "any man" who worships the beast and his image and receives the mark. This is a tribulation-specific group. The same subject-limitation noted in IB008 (the "any man" category) applies here: the torment language specifies a specific class, not all humans in history.

The immediate structural sequel (vv.12-13) establishes the antithesis: the beast-worshippers have "no rest day nor night" (v.11); the saints are commanded to patiently endure (v.12); the dead in the Lord shall "rest" (v.13). This contrast between "no rest" (v.11) and "rest" (v.13) using the same Greek root (anapausis / anapauō) is structurally deliberate (see Section 8 below).

## Section 3: Revelation 14:9-11 — Verse-by-Verse Greek Analysis

### Verse 9: The Subject of the Judgment

"If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand..."

The conditional protasis identifies the specific class: those who (a) worship the beast and his image, and (b) receive the mark. These are human beings who make a specific choice during the tribulation period. The judgment announced in vv.10-11 applies to this specific subject class.

### Verse 10: The Nature of the Torment

"The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and **he shall be tormented** [basanisthēsetai — G928, Future Passive Indicative, 3rd Person Singular] with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb."

Greek morphological observations (from raw-data/greek-parsing.md):

1. **basanisthēsetai** (G928): Future Passive Indicative 3rd Singular. The torment is presented as a *future event* from the perspective of the vision — "he shall be tormented." This is not a description of an ongoing state already in progress; it is a prophetic announcement of what shall occur.

2. **The cup of wrath**: The cup imagery directly parallels Jer 25:15-29, where all nations drink the wine of God's wrath. Edom is among the nations listed (Jer 25:21). This OT connection links the cup-of-wrath imagery with the same Edom/Babylon judgment complex from which Isa 34:10 comes.

3. **"In the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb"**: This phrase locates the torment relative to a specific judicial event — the judgment in the presence of witnesses — rather than specifying duration. The phrase does not say "for ever and ever"; it identifies the occasion of the torment. Both sides must acknowledge this.

4. **Fire and brimstone**: The Nave's BRIMSTONE entry lists ALL Revelation uses of brimstone as FIGURATIVE, with the literal anchor being Sodom (Gen 19:24; Luk 17:29). Fire-and-brimstone in Revelation consistently draws on the Sodom destruction type — which produced ashes (2 Pet 2:6) and smoke that went up as the smoke of a furnace (Gen 19:28).

### Verse 11: The Smoke and the Formula

"And **the smoke** [ho kapnos, N-NSM — nominative subject] of their torment [tou basanismou autōn, N-GSM — genitive attribute] **ascendeth** [anabainei, Present Active Indicative 3rd Singular] **for ever and ever** [eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn]; and they have no rest [anapausin ouk ekhousin] day nor night [hēmeras kai nyktos], who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name."

Greek morphological observations (confirmed by greek-parsing.md tool data):

1. **ho kapnos is the nominative subject** (E211, confirmed): The smoke ascends. The torment (basanismou) is genitive — the smoke OF the torment, not the torment itself ascending. The "for ever and ever" modifier attaches to the ascending of the smoke, not to the torment's duration as such.

2. **anabainei is Present Active Indicative** (E211 notes): The present tense in apocalyptic vision narrative typically represents what the seer sees in the vision, not a duration statement about literal continuous ongoing process. The present tense is the tense of prophetic vision — "I see the smoke ascending."

3. **eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn**: The formula "into the ages of the ages" (G165 twice; see E213). The question of what this formula means when applied to the smoke is precisely the IB009 question — and the Rev 19:3 structural parallel (Section 4 below) is the decisive SIS connection.

4. **anapausin ouk ekhousin hēmeras kai nyktos**: "Rest they have not day and night." This exact Greek construction also appears in Rev 4:8 for the living creatures (Section 8 below). The phrase characterizes the unceasing nature of an activity — but what "unceasing" means depends on the subject and context.

5. **Subject specification**: The verse closes by re-specifying the subject: "who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name." The "no rest" language applies to this specific tribulation class, not to all the wicked.

## Section 4: Revelation 19:1-5 — The Babylon Structural Argument

This is the most significant structural argument in the entire study. Revelation 19:3 uses the identical formula for Babylon's smoke that appears in Rev 14:11 for the beast-worshippers:

**Rev 14:11:** "...the smoke [kapnos] of their torment **ascendeth up** [anabainei] **for ever and ever** [eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn]..."

**Rev 19:3:** "And her **smoke** [kapnos] **rose up** [anabainei — same present active indicative 3rd singular form] **for ever and ever** [eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn]."

The Greek parsing confirms: the formula is grammatically identical. Same noun (kapnos, G2586). Same verb form (anabainei, Pres Act Ind 3S). Same prepositional formula (eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn). The pronoun case differs: Rev 14:11 uses tou basanismou autōn (genitive plural — the torment of them), while Rev 19:3 uses autēs (genitive singular feminine — referring to Babylon, a grammatically feminine noun). But the formula is the same.

The context of Rev 19:3 must be understood clearly:

**Rev 18:1-24 precedes Rev 19:3 directly.** Chapter 18 describes Babylon's fall:
- Rev 18:9: "the kings of the earth...shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the **smoke of her burning**"
- Rev 18:17: "For in one hour so great riches is come to nought"
- Rev 18:18: "cried when they saw the **smoke of her burning**"
- Rev 18:19: "For in one hour is she made desolate"
- Rev 18:21: "And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and **shall be found no more at all**."
- Rev 18:23: "And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee"

Then Rev 19:1-4 describes heaven's response to the completed judgment:
- Rev 19:2: "For true and righteous are his judgments: for **he hath judged** [ekrina, Aorist — completed action] the great whore...and hath avenged the blood of his servants"
- Rev 19:3: "And again they said, Alleluia. And **her smoke rose up for ever and ever**."

The logical structure is unmistakable:
1. Babylon has been destroyed — "in one hour" (Rev 18:17,19), "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21)
2. The judgment is described as complete — "he hath judged" (Aorist, Rev 19:2)
3. The formula "smoke rose up for ever and ever" is applied to this completed, permanent destruction

Babylon in this passage is not perpetually burning while conscious. Babylon is destroyed, thrown down like a millstone into the sea, and "found no more at all." The smoke-for-ever formula describes the permanent, irreversible character of that completed destruction — not an ongoing burning process.

**The Rev 19:3 parallel constitutes the strongest possible SIS (#4a) evidence for reading Rev 14:11:** the same author, the same book, using the identical Greek formula (verified by parsing tools) for an entity that is demonstrably and permanently destroyed rather than perpetually burning. If the formula means "still burning consciously for ever" when applied to Babylon, it would contradict the book's own narrative in Rev 18. The only coherent reading of both Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3 within the same book is that the formula denotes the permanent, irreversible character of the destruction — not an ongoing burning process.

## Section 5: Revelation 20:7-15 — The Final Judgment Sequence and the Subjects

### Subjects in Rev 20:10

"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and **shall be tormented** [basanisthēsontai, Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural] **day and night for ever and ever**." (Rev 20:10)

E212 (established in etc5-08) documents:
- Three named subjects: the devil (diabolos), the beast (to therion), the false prophet (ho pseudoprophētes)
- These three are the same entities that the lake of fire was "prepared for" (Mat 25:41 names the devil and his angels; E214)
- The immediately following verse (Rev 20:15) casts the human wicked into the lake without repeating the "tormented day and night for ever and ever" language

E180 (established in etc5-06) documents:
- In the same chapter (Rev 20:9), the nations surrounding the camp of the saints are "devoured" (katephagen) by fire — consumption vocabulary
- The adjacent verse (Rev 20:10) applies torment vocabulary to the three named supernatural entities
- Different vocabulary is used for different subjects in adjacent verses within the same passage

This vocabulary distinction is significant: the three named entities in Rev 20:10 are not identified as human beings. The beast and false prophet, whatever their nature (human, supernatural, or symbolic institutions), are the named targets of the specific torment language. Rev 20:15 ("And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire") applies the lake of fire to the general human wicked without the "tormented day and night for ever and ever" formula.

### Rev 20:11-15 Context

The sequence:
- Rev 20:11: Great white throne; earth and heaven flee
- Rev 20:12-13: Dead raised; sea, death, and hades give up their dead; judged by works
- Rev 20:14: Death and hades cast into the lake of fire — "this is the second death"
- Rev 20:15: Whoever not in the book of life cast into the lake of fire

The judgment includes all humans. The outcome is the lake of fire (= second death, E148, N021). Torment language ("day and night for ever and ever") is not applied to the general human wicked in Rev 20 — only to the three named entities in v.10.

## Section 6: Isaiah 34:9-10 — The OT Source Text and Its Present State

The cross-testament parallel tool identifies Isa 34:10 as the highest-scoring OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (hybrid score 0.401) AND for Rev 19:3 (score 0.330). This is not a subjective judgment — it is a tool-verified quantitative score. Isa 34:10 is the primary OT source text for the smoke-ascending-forever formula in Revelation.

### The Hebrew of Isaiah 34:9-10

**Isa 34:9:** "And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone [H1614, gophrith], and the land thereof shall become burning pitch."

**Isa 34:10:** "It shall not be quenched night nor day [lo tikbeh laylah ve-yomam]; the smoke [H6227, ashan] thereof shall go up for ever [le-olam]; from generation to generation [le-dor va-dor] it shall lie waste [techérav]; none shall pass through it for ever and ever [ad-olam ve-ad]."

Hebrew analysis:
1. **H1614 gophrith** (brimstone): The same word used for Sodom's destruction (Gen 19:24). This passage explicitly sets up the Sodom parallel before the smoke formula.
2. **H6227 ashan** (smoke): The primary Hebrew smoke word (25 occurrences). The LXX renders ashan as G2586 kapnos with PMI 9.95, count 20, score 30.28 — the dominant primary mapping. This confirms that Revelation's kapnos in Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3 directly corresponds to Isa 34:10's ashan.
3. **le-olam / ad-olam ve-ad**: The same H5769 (olam) terminology established in N034 (duration contextually determined by subject's nature). In this passage, olam describes the permanent desolation of Edom's land.
4. **techérav** ("it shall lie waste"): The land lies desolate. The smoke ascends from a waste place, not from ongoing burning of conscious persons.

### Isaiah 34:11-17: What Follows the Smoke-for-Ever

Immediately after the smoke-ascending-forever announcement (v.10), the text describes what the land looks like:

- Vv.11-15: Owls, ravens, jackals, ostriches, great owls, vultures, kites, screech owls, and other wild creatures possess the land. The pelican and porcupine possess it.
- V.15: The great owl makes her nest and lays eggs; the vultures are gathered.
- V.16-17: "Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate...the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it."
- V.17: "He hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever [le-olam], from generation to generation shall they dwell therein."

E192 (established in etc5-07) documents this: after the smoke-for-ever declaration, the land is inhabited by wild animals permanently. This is not the description of an ongoing burning conscious experience. It is the description of a permanently desolated wasteland that animals possess.

The "smoke ascending for ever" in Isa 34:10 describes the complete and permanent destruction of Edom. The aftermath is not ongoing fire but permanent waste land occupied by wild creatures. This is the OT source context that governs the formula when Revelation uses it.

### The Edom-Babylon Connection in the OT

The desolation prophecies of the OT link Edom, Sodom, and Babylon through the same formula:
- Isa 13:19-20: Babylon "shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited...from generation to generation"
- Jer 49:17-18: Edom "shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished...As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah"
- Jer 50:39-40: Babylon "no more inhabited for ever...As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah...it shall be no more inhabited for ever"

The same permanent-desolation pattern appears across all three: Sodom-type overthrow → permanent waste → never inhabited. None of these passages describes ongoing conscious burning; all describe permanent desolation. This is the OT semantic field from which Revelation draws its imagery.

## Section 7: G929 Basanismos Distribution in Revelation

G929 (basanismos, "torment") has 6 NT occurrences, ALL in Revelation (E172 establishes this). The distribution is highly significant:

| Reference | Context | Duration |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Rev 9:5 | Scorpion-sting torment of the fifth trumpet | **Explicitly limited: "five months"** (vv.5,10) |
| Rev 14:11 | Torment of beast-worshippers | Smoke ascending "for ever and ever" |
| Rev 18:7 | "Give her torment and sorrow" — Babylon | **Completed destruction event** |
| Rev 18:10 | "Alas, alas...for in one hour is thy judgment come" | **"In one hour"** |
| Rev 18:15 | "Shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment" | **Completed destruction event** |

Critical observations:
1. **Rev 9:5**: The same basanismos noun used in Rev 14:11 is used in Rev 9:5 to describe a *five-month limited* judgment. The noun does not inherently carry the meaning of eternal ongoing duration.
2. **Rev 18:7, 18:10, 18:15**: All three uses describe Babylon's judicial destruction — a completed event ("in one hour," "is come to nought"). The same noun that describes this five-minute or five-hour event also describes what is characterized as "smoke ascending for ever" in Rev 19:3.
3. **Distributional conclusion**: The word basanismos in Revelation describes (a) a five-month limited judgment (Rev 9:5), (b) a one-hour completed judgment (Rev 18:7,10,15), and (c) the smoke formula applied both to beast-worshippers (Rev 14:11) and to Babylon (Rev 19:3). The word itself does not determine duration — the formula "for ever and ever" determines the permanence of the *result*, as N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved)* establishes.

## Section 8: "No Rest Day or Night" — Comparing Rev 4:8 and Rev 14:11

The phrase in Rev 14:11 is: **anapausin ouk ekhousin hēmeras kai nyktos** — "rest they-have-not day and night."

The phrase in Rev 4:8 is: **anapausin ouk ekhousin hēmeras kai nyktos** — "rest they-have-not day and night."

The Greek parsing confirms (raw-data/greek-parsing.md): these are grammatically identical constructions. Same noun (anapausin, G372, Accusative Singular Feminine), same negation (ouk), same verb (ekhousin, Present Active Indicative 3rd Plural), same genitive time expression (hēmeras kai nyktos).

**Rev 4:8 context:** "And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come."

The living creatures' "no rest day and night" describes their *continuous worship activity* before God. There is nothing in this phrase that implies suffering or pain. The phrase describes unceasing, uninterrupted activity — in the Rev 4:8 case, positive worshipful activity.

When the identical phrase appears in Rev 14:11, it describes a different subject (beast-worshippers) in a different context (judgment). But the phrase itself, as demonstrated by Rev 4:8, means "unceasing activity without intermission" — not specifically "ongoing conscious suffering without end."

The two possible readings of "no rest day nor night" in Rev 14:11:

**(a) ECT reading:** Ongoing conscious suffering without any respite, continuing forever. The "no rest" specifies perpetual conscious torment.

**(b) Desolation/judgment-process reading:** The judgment that overtakes them admits of no rest, no reprieve, no escape. The "no rest" characterizes the thoroughness and finality of the judgment (its unceasing pursuit of them until completion), consistent with how Rev 4:8 uses the identical phrase for continuous activity — here the continuous activity is the divine judgment itself.

Reading (b) is consistent with Rev 4:8's use of the identical phrase for unceasing *activity* (not suffering), and consistent with the Rev 19:3 parallel (same formula for Babylon's completed destruction). Reading (a) is consistent with the surface-level implication of "no rest" applied to persons under judgment.

Both readings are grammatically possible. The SIS connections (Rev 4:8 identical phrase = unceasing activity; Rev 19:3 same formula = completed destruction) give weight to reading (b). This is an I-B tension addressed below (IB014, new item).

---

## Section 9: "For Ever and Ever" Distribution in Revelation

The formula "for ever and ever" (eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn, using G165 twice — E213) appears a total of 12 times in the KJV Revelation (see PROMPT.md list): Rev 1:6; 4:9; 4:10; 5:13; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 14:11; 15:3; 15:7; 19:3; 20:10; 22:5.

By subject:
- **God/Christ/saints** (11 uses): Rev 1:6; 4:9; 4:10; 5:13; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 15:3; 15:7; 22:5
- **Judgment subjects** (3 uses): Rev 14:11 (beast-worshippers' smoke); Rev 19:3 (Babylon's smoke); Rev 20:10 (devil/beast/false prophet tormented)

The 11 uses applied to God and the saints describe entities whose existence is inherently endless — God lives "for ever and ever" because he is by nature immortal; the redeemed "reign for ever and ever" because they have been given immortality at the resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54; Rev 22:5).

N034 establishes: the duration olam (and by N035 extension, the Greek eis aionas) denotes is contextually determined by the nature of the subject. The same formula that describes God's endless existence can describe the permanence of a desolated land (Isa 34:10) or the permanent ruin of a destroyed city (Rev 19:3) — because "for ever" adapts to what the subject's nature allows.

For Babylon: permanent destruction is the nature of the outcome. "Smoke rising for ever and ever" describes the permanent, irreversible character of the completed destruction.

For the devil, beast, and false prophet: E149 (Neutral, reclassified from ECT in etc5-18 audit) presents their ongoing torment; IB008 (Moderate toward not extending to all humans) addresses the subject limitation.

For beast-worshippers: this is the contested case. The subject is human beast-worshippers. Whether "smoke of their torment for ever and ever" describes ongoing conscious torment (former ECT reading of E150, reclassified Neutral etc5-18) or permanent, irreversible destruction (desolation reading, grounded in Isa 34:10 source text and Rev 19:3 Babylon parallel) is the IB009 question.

## Section 10: The Sodom / Eternal Fire / Ashes Chain

N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved after Study 5)* (established in etc5-05) is the foundation for this section. The full chain:

**Step 1 — Sodom's destruction:**
- Gen 19:24: "the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven"
- Gen 19:28: "the smoke [H6227, ashan] of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace" — Abraham sees this the morning AFTER the destruction. The smoke is visible as a residue of the past destruction event, not as evidence of ongoing burning.

**Step 2 — NT interpretation of Sodom's fire:**
- Jude 1:7: Sodom and Gomorrah "are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire [puros aioniou]." The Sodom cities are called an "example" of eternal fire.
- 2 Pet 2:6: "turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha **into ashes** [tephrosas, G4871 = reduced to ashes] condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly."

**Step 3 — The necessary implication (N029, reclassified to IB009-resolved):**
Both passages describe the same event. Jude calls it "eternal fire." Peter calls the result "ashes." The eternal fire of Sodom has not been literally burning since Genesis — the cities are in the Dead Sea region and their fire was extinguished millennia ago. The "eternal" character of the fire refers to the permanent, irreversible result of the destruction (ashes), not to the ongoing duration of the burning process. This is N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved)*, a plain textual observation about the same event described by the same author (Jude/2 Peter are likely from the same author tradition).

**Step 4 — The Edom smoke chain:**
- Isa 34:9 (brimstone — H1614, same word as Sodom): "the dust thereof into brimstone"
- Isa 34:10 (smoke for ever): the smoke of Edom's judgment ascending for ever
- Isa 34:11-17 (aftermath = desolation with animals): not ongoing burning, but permanent waste

**Step 5 — Application to Revelation:**
- The "fire and brimstone" of Rev 14:10 draws directly on the Sodom-type judgment vocabulary (Nave's BRIMSTONE: ALL Revelation uses = FIGURATIVE; literal anchor = Sodom)
- The smoke-for-ever formula (Rev 14:11) draws directly on Isa 34:10 (tool-confirmed #1 OT parallel, score 0.401)
- Rev 19:3 (Babylon's smoke for ever) draws on the same formula for a clearly completed destruction
- The result: N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved)* (eternal fire = permanent result) governs the fire-and-brimstone imagery; the OT source (Isa 34:10 = wasteland, not ongoing burning) governs the smoke-formula meaning

The Sodom-Edom-Babylon chain is a continuous literary typology in which the same formula (fire-and-brimstone → smoke for ever → permanent desolation) is applied to each successive judgment in an escalating series. In none of the OT instances does the formula describe ongoing conscious suffering. In each case, the aftermath is desolation without inhabitants.

## Section 11: IB009 SIS Resolution Assessment — Moderate to Strong

**Current state (entering etc5-11):** IB009 is resolved Moderate toward literary formula / permanent-desolation imagery.

**New evidence bearing on IB009 from this study:**

1. **Rev 19:3 structural parallel (new E250 below):** The identical Greek formula (kapnos + anabainei + eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn) is applied in Rev 19:3 to Babylon — which is described in the immediately preceding chapter (Rev 18) as destroyed "in one hour," "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21), and "never be inhabited" (drawing on the OT desolation prophecies). The judgment is declared complete: "he hath judged" (Aorist, Rev 19:2). Same author. Same book. Same formula. Demonstrably completed destruction.

2. **Basanismos distribution (new E251, E252 below):** The noun basanismos (G929), used in Rev 14:11 for the beast-worshippers' torment, is used three times in Rev 18 for Babylon's completed one-hour judicial destruction. The same noun describes both "five months" (Rev 9:5) and Babylon's completed judicial event. The noun does not determine perpetual duration.

3. **Rev 4:8 / Rev 14:11 anapausis identity (new E253 below):** The "no rest day and night" phrase (grammatically identical) in Rev 4:8 describes the living creatures' unceasing worship — positive continuous activity, not conscious suffering. This demonstrates that the phrase describes unceasing activity without specifying suffering, leaving the "no rest" language in Rev 14:11 ambiguous as to whether it specifies ongoing conscious torment or unceasing judgment process.

**Applying the 5-Step I-B SIS Protocol:**

*Step 1 — State the competing claims:*
- FOR (literary formula / desolation): The smoke-ascending-forever formula in Rev 14:11 is a literary formula drawn from Isa 34:10's OT desolation imagery, describing the permanent, irreversible result of destruction, not ongoing conscious torment in perpetuity.
- AGAINST (ongoing torment): The formula, combined with "no rest day nor night" and applied to human beast-worshippers who are "tormented" (basanizo), describes perpetual ongoing conscious suffering.

*Step 2 — Identify the Plain-level items on each side:*

**FOR literary formula/desolation — Plain items:**
- Rev 19:3 (new E250): Same formula, same author, same book, applied to Babylon which is explicitly "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21). This is a Plain SIS connection: within Revelation itself, the identical formula demonstrates that "smoke ascending for ever and ever" can describe the permanent aftermath of completed destruction.
- N029: "Eternal fire" = permanent result (Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6 = same event = ashes). This is a Plain necessary implication that "for ever" fire/smoke language in biblical usage denotes permanent result, not ongoing process.
- E147: Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6 (same event: Sodom = eternal fire = ashes). Plain textual fact.
- E212: Rev 20:15 immediately following the torment description applies the lake of fire to human wicked without repeating the "tormented day and night for ever and ever" language. Both sides must acknowledge this Plain omission.

**AGAINST (ongoing torment) — what is its Plain level?**
- E150: "The smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night." The text explicitly states these things. E150 was classified ECT because it directly states the torment language (reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit).
- However: E150 was classified ECT because the text explicitly states ongoing torment language for beast-worshippers. The question is not whether the text says "torment" and "for ever and ever" — it does, plainly. The question is whether this statement, on its own, before the OT source context and within-book Babylon parallel are applied, constitutes a Plain statement that the torment is *ongoing and conscious and perpetual*.

The honest assessment: E150 is Plain in stating that (a) there is torment, (b) smoke ascends for ever and ever, (c) there is no rest day or night. But E150 is *Ambiguous* as to whether "for ever and ever" means ongoing conscious perpetual process (ECT) or permanent irrevocable destruction (desolation). The text says the smoke ascends for ever — it does not specify whether the persons are still consciously experiencing torment while the smoke ascends, or whether the smoke ascends as the permanent marker of their destruction.

*Step 3 — Apply SIS priority (#4a):*

The Rev 19:3 parallel is a #4a SIS connection of the highest caliber: same author, same book, same formula, demonstrably completed destruction context. When the same author uses the identical formula in the same book for a completed-destruction context, that usage governs the interpretation of the formula's other occurrence. This is the strongest possible form of #4a SIS.

The Isa 34:10 source text is also a #4a SIS connection: tool-verified highest-scoring OT parallel (0.401). The source text's context (desolation, not ongoing burning) governs the Revelation usage.

*Step 4 — Assess the result:*

The FOR-desolation side has:
- Plain items: Rev 19:3 (same formula, same book, completed destruction), N029 (eternal fire = ashes), E147 (Sodom eternal fire = ashes)
- Contextually Clear items: E182 (Isa 34:10 source text = wasteland aftermath), E192 (Isa 34:11-17 animals in desolation)

The AGAINST (ongoing torment) side has:
- E150 is Plain in stating torment/smoke/no-rest language; but *Ambiguous as to duration mechanism* given the within-book demonstration (Rev 19:3) that the identical formula applies to completed destruction

**Step 5 — Render the verdict:**

Strong resolution applies when: "Plain statements on one side" + "only Ambiguous or Contextually Clear statements on the other, with no Plain counter-items."

The FOR-desolation side has Plain items (Rev 19:3 within-book same-formula demonstration; N029 eternal fire = ashes). The AGAINST side's strongest item (E150) is Plain in stating the language but Ambiguous as to what the language *means* for duration once the Rev 19:3 within-book demonstration is considered.

**Verdict: Upgrade IB009 from Moderate to Strong — weight toward literary formula / permanent-desolation imagery.**

The Rev 19:3 within-book structural parallel is decisive. Within Revelation, the identical formula is used for Babylon's completed destruction. The OT source text (Isa 34:10) describes a desolated wasteland, not ongoing conscious torment. N029 establishes eternal fire = permanent result. The "no rest" phrase (Rev 4:8 parallel, new E253) is demonstrated within the same book to describe unceasing *activity* without implying suffering. Together these constitute Plain + Contextually Clear SIS evidence, with the AGAINST side reduced to Ambiguous statements once the within-book demonstration is applied.

**Important qualification:** This Strong resolution applies specifically to the *formula* "smoke ascending for ever and ever" as a literary construction. The torment language itself (basanizo) in v.10 and basanismos in v.11 does describe a genuine judicial torment — both the ECT and conditionalist readings acknowledge this. The conditionalist reading holds that the torment is real and intense, but that it is not perpetually ongoing — rather, it is the torment of the destruction event itself, whose *smoke* (aftermath marker) ascends permanently as testimony to the permanent irrevocability of the judgment. The IB009 resolution does not eliminate the torment; it addresses the duration mechanism of the "for ever and ever" formula.

## Summary of Analysis

The convergent evidence from this study points in a consistent direction:

1. **The OT source text (Isa 34:10)** — the tool-verified highest-scoring parallel for Rev 14:11 — depicts a desolated wasteland where animals dwell, not ongoing burning of conscious persons.

2. **The within-book Babylon parallel (Rev 19:3)** — the identical formula applied by the same author to a city that is explicitly "found no more at all" — demonstrates that the formula describes permanent, irreversible destruction, not ongoing burning.

3. **The basanismos distribution (Rev 9:5; 18:7,10,15)** — the same torment noun describes five-month limited judgment and one-hour completed destruction within the same book.

4. **The "no rest day and night" parallel (Rev 4:8)** — the identical Greek phrase describes the living creatures' unceasing worship, demonstrating that the phrase means "unceasing activity" without specifying ongoing suffering.

5. **N029 (eternal fire = permanent result; reclassified to IB009-resolved after Study 5)** — the Bible's own self-interpretation (Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6: Sodom = eternal fire = ashes) establishes that "eternal" fire/smoke language in biblical usage denotes permanent result.

6. **The "for ever and ever" distribution** — 11 of 12+ Revelation uses apply to God/Christ/saints whose existence is inherently endless; when applied to judgment subjects, the formula adapts to the nature of the outcome (N034).

The former ECT reading of Rev 14:11 (E150, reclassified Neutral etc5-18) has genuine force from the direct text — the torment language, the smoke formula, the "no rest" language are all present. This is not to be dismissed. But these same elements are present when the formula is applied to Babylon (Rev 19:3) in a demonstrably completed-destruction context. The within-book demonstration that the formula can describe completed destruction is decisive for the Strong resolution of IB009.

The result is not that Rev 14:11 means nothing. It means: the beast-worshippers face a genuine judicial torment (basanizo) — a real and intense divine judgment — from which there is no rest and no reprieve, and whose permanent result (the ascending smoke) is an irrevocable, eternal marker of their complete destruction. The formula uses the language of Isa 34:10 and the Sodom typology, which throughout Scripture describe permanent, irrevocable destruction — not ongoing conscious existence in torment.
