# Verse Analysis

## Question

What do Revelation 14:9-11 and 19:3 describe? What is the OT background for the imagery of smoke ascending "for ever and ever," fire and brimstone, and "no rest day nor night"? Does this language describe ongoing conscious torment, or does it describe the permanent and complete nature of destruction?

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Isaiah 34:8-17 (Edom's Judgment -- Primary OT Source)

**Context:** Isaiah 34 is a prophetic oracle against Edom (and, in the broader chapter, against all nations). It describes "the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion" (v.8). This is a specific historical/prophetic judgment on the land and people of Edom.

**Direct statement:** Edom's land is turned to "burning pitch" (v.9). Its dust becomes brimstone. The fire "shall not be quenched night nor day" (v.10a). "The smoke thereof shall go up for ever" (v.10b). "From generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever" (v.10c).

**Key observations:**
1. The phrase "not quenched night nor day" (v.10) uses the identical "day and night" formula found in Rev 14:11 and Rev 20:10.
2. "The smoke thereof shall go up for ever" uses the identical smoke-ascending formula found in Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3.
3. After this "smoke ascending for ever" and "not quenched night nor day" language, verses 11-17 describe animals permanently dwelling in the desolate ruins: cormorants, bitterns, owls, ravens, thorns, nettles, brambles, jackals, satyrs, screech owls, great owls, vultures.
4. Verse 14 states the screech owl "shall rest there" -- the land whose fire is "not quenched night nor day" now has animals resting in it.
5. Verse 17 states "they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein" -- referring to the animals.
6. The smoke-formula in its OT source describes permanent uninhabitable desolation, not perpetual combustion. The fire has done its work; the smoke (memorial of destruction) is what persists conceptually.
7. Edom's territory is not presently burning. The judgment was executed and completed. The result is permanent.

**Cross-references:** This passage is the highest-scoring OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (tool-verified, score 0.401). The verbal correspondence includes: "smoke" + "ascending" + "for ever" + "not quenched night nor day" + "brimstone." The same passage is the top OT parallel for Rev 19:3 (score 0.330). E266, E282, E293, E315 document these connections.

### Genesis 19:24-28 (Sodom's Destruction -- Foundational Type)

**Context:** The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire and brimstone from heaven. This is the first biblical occurrence of fire-and-brimstone as a mode of divine judgment.

**Direct statement:** "The LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven" (v.24). "He overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities" (v.25). Abraham "looked... and beheld... the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace" (v.28).

**Key observations:**
1. The vocabulary is consistently destruction: "overthrew" (v.25), "destroyed" (v.29 -- same root).
2. Abraham observes the aftermath: ascending smoke from a completed destruction event. The cities are gone. The smoke is the evidence of what the fire did.
3. This is the foundational type for all subsequent fire-and-brimstone imagery in Scripture. Every later reference to fire and brimstone as divine judgment draws on this paradigm.
4. Jesus describes this event: "it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all" (Luke 17:29). The vocabulary is apollymi -- destruction.
5. Jude 1:7 calls this "the vengeance of eternal fire" and says Sodom is "set forth for an example." Sodom is not still burning. The fire was "eternal" (aionios) in result, not in ongoing combustion.
6. 2 Peter 2:6 says God turned Sodom "into ashes" and made it "an ensample." The result of the fire-and-brimstone judgment is ashes.

**Cross-references:** Gen 19:28 parallels with Isa 34:10 (fire/brimstone + smoke ascending), Rev 18:9 (smoke of her burning observed), Jude 1:7 and 2 Pet 2:6 (Sodom as example). E202 documents the "eternal fire" applied to Sodom.

---

### Malachi 4:1-3 (Eschatological Judgment -- Burning Up)

**Context:** The last chapter of the OT prophets. This is an eschatological text: "the day cometh" -- a future judgment day.

**Direct statement:** "The day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch" (v.1). "Ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet" (v.3).

**Key observations:**
1. The wicked are compared to "stubble" -- consumed quickly and completely by fire.
2. "Burn them up" -- the fire consumes the fuel entirely.
3. "Leave them neither root nor branch" -- nothing of them remains. Complete destruction.
4. "Ashes under the soles of your feet" -- the wicked are reduced to ashes. The righteous walk on the ashes of the destroyed wicked.
5. This is an OT eschatological text using fire imagery for complete consumption. The end product is ashes, not ongoing burning.
6. Already registered as E245 (Cond.) and E246 (Cond.) in etc-06.

**Cross-references:** The oven/fire/stubble/ashes imagery in Malachi parallels the chaff-burning of Matt 3:12, the tares-burning of Matt 13:40-42, and the destruction vocabulary pattern documented in etc-06.

### Revelation 14:9-11 (Third Angel's Warning)

**Context:** This is the third of three angelic messages in Rev 14:6-13. The first angel proclaims the everlasting gospel and the hour of judgment (vv.6-7). The second announces Babylon's fall (v.8). The third warns about worshipping the beast (vv.9-11). The passage concludes with the patience of the saints (v.12) and the blessing on the dead in the Lord who "rest from their labours" (v.13).

**Direct statement:** "If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark... The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name" (vv.9-11).

**Key observations:**
1. **Genre:** This occurs within an apocalyptic vision (Revelation classified as VISION by Nave's; Rev 1:1 communicates through signs). Tree 3 Gate 3 applies.
2. **Subjects:** "Any man" who worships the beast and its image. The subjects are human, but they are described in relation to symbolic entities (the beast, its image, its mark) that are part of Revelation's apocalyptic framework. The "beast" is not a literal animal but a symbolic entity (E205).
3. **"Tormented with fire and brimstone":** The OT fire-and-brimstone paradigm, from its first occurrence (Gen 19:24 Sodom), describes destruction. Every OT brimstone passage (H1614 gophriyth, 7 occurrences) describes destructive judgment. Luke 17:29, the only non-Revelation NT use of theion (G2303), says the fire and brimstone "destroyed them all."
4. **"Smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever":** The verbal correspondence with Isa 34:10 ("the smoke thereof shall go up for ever") is the highest-scoring OT parallel (tool-verified, 0.401). In the OT source, this describes permanent desolation with animals inhabiting the ruins, not ongoing combustion.
5. **"No rest day nor night":** The phrase uses anapausis (G372). The same word appears in Rev 4:8, where the living creatures "rest not day and night" in ceaseless praise. The Rev 4:8 usage demonstrates that "rest not day and night" characterizes the continuous nature of an activity during its duration, not necessarily an eternal conscious state.
6. **basanismos (G929) in same-book context:** The noun "torment" (basanismos) occurs 6 times -- all in Revelation. Three describe Babylon's "torment" (Rev 18:7,10,15). But Babylon's "torment" IS her destruction: "utterly burned with fire" (18:8), "in one hour" (18:10,17), "thrown down, and shall be found no more at all" (18:21). The same word describes a completed destruction event for Babylon.
7. **Contrast with v.13:** Two verses later, the faithful dead "rest" (anapauomai, cognate of anapausis) from their labors. Beast-worshippers: no rest. Faithful dead: rest. The contrast functions within the passage's own literary structure.
8. **"In the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb":** The torment occurs before the Lamb and the angels -- a public judgment event. This language does not describe a hidden ongoing state but a visible execution of judgment.

---

### Revelation 19:1-3 (Babylon's Smoke Ascends)

**Context:** Following the destruction of Babylon described in Rev 17-18, the heavenly host celebrates. This is a doxological/praise passage.

**Direct statement:** "True and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore... and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever" (vv.2-3).

**Key observations:**
1. Rev 19:3 uses the identical "smoke... for ever and ever" (eis tous aionas ton aionon) formula as Rev 14:11.
2. This formula is applied to Babylon -- a symbolic entity ("MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT," Rev 17:5). E316 documents this.
3. Babylon's destruction is described in detail in Rev 17-18: burned with fire (17:16), utterly burned (18:8), come to nought in one hour (18:17), thrown down, found no more at all (18:21).
4. Babylon's "torment" (basanismos, 18:7,10,15) IS her destruction. The smoke of her burning is observed by kings, merchants, and shipmasters who stand afar off (18:9,15,18).
5. The ascending smoke in 19:3 is the memorial/evidence of a completed destruction event -- the same function smoke serves in Gen 19:28 (Abraham observing Sodom's smoke) and Isa 34:10 (Edom's smoke ascending for ever).
6. This is the strongest same-book, same-author, same-formula evidence for interpreting the "smoke ascending for ever" language: the same formula that some interpret as eternal conscious torment in Rev 14:11 is applied to Babylon's completed destruction in Rev 19:3.

---

### Revelation 20:9-10 (Fire Devoured / Devil, Beast, False Prophet)

**Context:** After the thousand years, Satan is released. The wicked surround the camp of the saints. Fire comes down. The devil is cast into the lake of fire.

**Direct statement:** "Fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them" (v.9). "The devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever" (v.10).

**Key observations:**
1. **Different subjects, different descriptions:** Verse 9 describes the human enemies being "devoured" (katephagen) -- destruction vocabulary. Verse 10 describes the devil, the beast, and the false prophet being "tormented day and night for ever and ever."
2. The beast and the false prophet are symbolic entities (E205). The devil is a non-human spirit being. None of the three subjects in v.10 is a literal human being.
3. The human enemies in v.9 are described with destruction vocabulary ("devoured"), not torment vocabulary.
4. Rev 20:14-15 then describes death, hades, and unsaved humans being cast into the lake of fire. When humans enter, the identifying term is "second death" (E204) -- death vocabulary, not torment vocabulary.
5. The text does not say "the wicked shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever." It says the devil, beast, and false prophet experience this. The human fate is described as "devoured" (v.9) and "second death" (vv.14-15).

---

### Revelation 4:8 (Living Creatures "Rest Not Day and Night")

**Context:** John's vision of the throne room of God.

**Direct statement:** "The four beasts... rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty."

**Key observations:**
1. Uses the same word anapausis (G372) as Rev 14:11.
2. The living creatures "rest not day and night" in ceaseless divine praise.
3. This establishes that "rest not day and night" can describe the continuous and uninterrupted nature of an activity during its execution.
4. The phrase characterizes the quality and completeness of the activity, not necessarily its eternal metaphysical duration.

---

### Revelation 18:7-10,15,21 (Babylon's Basanismos)

**Context:** The fall of Babylon.

**Direct statement:** "So much torment and sorrow give her" (v.7). "She shall be utterly burned with fire" (v.8). "Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas... for in one hour is thy judgment come" (v.10). "The merchants... shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment" (v.15). "Thrown down, and shall be found no more at all" (v.21).

**Key observations:**
1. Basanismos (G929) is used three times for Babylon's "torment" (18:7,10,15).
2. Babylon's "torment" is described as: utterly burned with fire (v.8), come in one hour (v.10,17), thrown down and found no more at all (v.21).
3. The "torment" IS the destruction. Basanismos describes the judgment event itself, which is a completed and total destruction.
4. This is the closest same-book, same-word context for interpreting basanismos in Rev 14:11. Three of the six NT occurrences of basanismos describe a completed destruction event.

---

### Psalm 37:20 (Wicked Consume Into Smoke)

**Context:** A Davidic psalm contrasting the fates of the righteous and the wicked.

**Direct statement:** "The wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away."

**Key observations:**
1. Smoke is the END PRODUCT of consumption. Fat of lambs on the altar was consumed entirely -- nothing remained but ascending smoke.
2. "They shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away" describes a process that ends with the wicked gone and only smoke remaining.
3. The smoke is evidence that consumption is complete, not evidence of ongoing existence.
4. Already registered as E217 (Cond.).

---

### Hosea 13:3 (Smoke as Transience)

**Context:** God's judgment on Ephraim.

**Direct statement:** "They shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney."

**Key observations:**
1. Four images of transience: morning cloud, early dew, chaff, chimney smoke. All dissipate and are gone.
2. Smoke = ephemeral, vanishing, transient.
3. Already registered as E248 (Cond.).

---

### Isaiah 51:6 (Heavens Vanish Like Smoke)

**Context:** God's word of comfort and salvation contrasted with the passing of the physical creation.

**Direct statement:** "The heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment."

**Key observations:**
1. Smoke = vanishing, ceasing to be visible.
2. Contrasted with God's salvation which "shall be for ever."

---

### Ezekiel 28:18-19 (Fire from Within / Ashes / Never Be Any More)

**Context:** Prophetic oracle against the king of Tyre (with possible typological overtones).

**Direct statement:** "I will bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth" (v.18). "Thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more" (v.19).

**Key observations:**
1. Fire devours, produces ashes, and the subject is "never... any more."
2. The fire leads to non-existence -- ashes and ceasing to be.

---

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: The OT Fire-and-Brimstone Paradigm (Destruction, Not Ongoing Torment)

From its first occurrence (Gen 19:24 -- Sodom) through every subsequent use, the fire-and-brimstone pattern describes destructive judgment with a completed result:
- **Gen 19:24-28:** Fire and brimstone "overthrew" the cities. Abraham observed ascending smoke afterward.
- **Deut 29:23:** Aftermath = brimstone, salt, burning -- desolate, barren landscape.
- **Isa 34:9-10:** Edom's dust turns to brimstone, smoke ascends "for ever" -- but animals dwell in the ruins (vv.11-17).
- **Isa 30:33:** Tophet with fire and brimstone -- a place of burning/consumption.
- **Ps 11:6:** Fire and brimstone upon the wicked -- "the portion of their cup" (paralleling Rev 14:10).
- **Ezek 38:22:** Fire and brimstone in eschatological judgment against Gog.
- **Luke 17:29:** Jesus says the fire and brimstone "destroyed them all."
- **Jude 1:7:** "Eternal fire" applied to Sodom -- "example" of judgment. Sodom is not still burning.
- **2 Pet 2:6:** Sodom turned "into ashes" -- "ensample" of what awaits the ungodly.

In no OT passage does fire and brimstone describe ongoing conscious torment. Every instance describes an act of destruction whose result is permanent.

### Pattern 2: Smoke as End-Product of Consumption / Memorial of Completed Destruction

- **Ps 37:20:** Wicked "consume; into smoke shall they consume away" -- smoke is what remains after consumption.
- **Ps 68:2:** "As smoke is driven away" -- wicked perish.
- **Hos 13:3:** Smoke from chimney = transience, vanishing.
- **Isa 51:6:** Heavens vanish like smoke.
- **Gen 19:28:** Abraham sees Sodom's smoke ascending -- from a completed destruction.
- **Isa 34:10:** Edom's smoke ascends "for ever" -- from a completed judgment; animals dwell there.
- **Rev 18:9,18:** Onlookers see "the smoke of her burning" -- Babylon is already destroyed.
- **Rev 19:3:** "Her smoke rose up for ever and ever" -- Babylon is "thrown down, found no more."

In the OT, smoke consistently represents the aftermath/evidence of completed destruction or transience and vanishing. It does not represent ongoing conscious existence.

### Pattern 3: Basanismos in Same-Book Context (Babylon's "Torment" = Destruction)

The noun basanismos (G929) occurs 6 times -- all in Revelation:
1. Rev 9:5 -- scorpion torment, limited to 5 months (temporary)
2. Rev 14:11 -- smoke of their torment (the passage under study)
3. Rev 18:7 -- Babylon's torment
4. Rev 18:10 -- Babylon's torment
5. Rev 18:15 -- Babylon's torment

Three of six occurrences describe Babylon's "torment," and Babylon's "torment" IS her destruction: utterly burned with fire (18:8), in one hour (18:10,17), thrown down and found no more at all (18:21). One occurrence (Rev 9:5) has an explicit time limit of 5 months. The same-book context demonstrates that basanismos does not require "eternal conscious suffering" as its meaning.

### Pattern 4: "No Rest Day and Night" as Quality of Activity, Not Duration

- **Rev 4:8:** Living creatures "rest not day and night" in praising God.
- **Rev 14:11:** Beast-worshippers have "no rest day nor night."
- **Isa 34:10:** Edom's fire "shall not be quenched night nor day."

The Rev 4:8 usage shows that "rest not day and night" characterizes the continuous and uninterrupted nature of an activity. In Isa 34:10, the "not quenched night nor day" describes the irresistibility and completeness of the fire's work, followed by animals dwelling in the desolated ruins. The phrase describes the totality and intensity of the activity during its execution.

### Pattern 5: Different Subjects Receive Different Descriptions in Rev 20

- **Rev 20:9:** Human enemies "devoured" by fire (destruction vocabulary).
- **Rev 20:10:** Devil, beast, and false prophet "tormented day and night for ever and ever" (the beast and false prophet are symbolic entities; the devil is non-human).
- **Rev 20:14-15:** Humans cast into the lake of fire -- identified as "the second death" (death vocabulary, not torment vocabulary).

The text itself distinguishes between the fate of symbolic/non-human entities (tormented) and literal humans (devoured/second death).

## Connections Between Passages

### The Isa 34:10 --> Rev 14:11 / Rev 19:3 Verbal Chain

The verbal correspondence is exact:
- Isa 34:10: "smoke... shall go up for ever" + "not quenched night nor day" + "brimstone"
- Rev 14:11: "smoke... ascendeth up for ever and ever" + "no rest day nor night" + "fire and brimstone"
- Rev 19:3: "smoke rose up for ever and ever"

The parallels tool confirms this: Isa 34:10 is the highest-scoring OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (0.401) and for Rev 19:3 (0.330). The connection is verified via shared vocabulary and identical idiom (#4a SIS).

In the OT source, this formula describes a completed, irreversible judgment followed by permanent desolation (animals dwell in the ruins). The formula is a memorial of judgment, not a description of ongoing conscious experience.

### The Rev 14:11 <-> Rev 19:3 Same-Formula Connection

The same "smoke... for ever and ever" formula is used for:
- Beast-worshippers (Rev 14:11)
- Symbolic Babylon (Rev 19:3)

Babylon is explicitly described as utterly destroyed (Rev 18:8,17,21). The smoke of Babylon "rose up for ever and ever" after she has been "thrown down, and shall be found no more at all." The same formula that some interpret as ongoing conscious torment in 14:11 describes a completed destruction in 19:3. Same author, same book, same formula.

### The Gen 19 --> Isa 34 --> Rev 14/19 Fire-and-Brimstone Arc

1. **Gen 19:24:** First fire-and-brimstone judgment. Result: destruction. Smoke observed afterward.
2. **Isa 34:9-10:** Edom's brimstone judgment. "Smoke ascending for ever." Animals inhabit the ruins.
3. **Rev 14:10-11:** "Tormented with fire and brimstone." "Smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever."
4. **Rev 19:3:** Babylon's "smoke rose up for ever and ever."

Each later occurrence draws on the earlier: Isa 34 draws on Gen 19's fire-and-brimstone; Revelation draws on Isa 34's smoke-ascending-for-ever. The OT source texts consistently describe destruction with permanent results, not ongoing conscious torment.

### The Basanismos Chain (Rev 9:5 --> Rev 14:11 --> Rev 18:7,10,15)

Basanismos appears to describe: a temporary affliction (9:5, five months), the judgment of beast-worshippers (14:11), and the destruction of Babylon (18:7,10,15). The Babylon usage is the most extensive (3 of 6 occurrences) and the most interpretively informative: Babylon's "torment" is her total, completed destruction.

### The Anapausis Contrast (Rev 4:8, 14:11, 14:13)

Rev 14:11 ("no rest day nor night") is flanked by:
- Rev 4:8: living creatures praise without rest (no anapausis) day and night
- Rev 14:13: the faithful dead rest (anapauomai) from their labors

The contrast is: beast-worshippers face judgment admitting no respite; the faithful dead enter rest. The anapausis in Rev 4:8 characterizes uninterrupted activity, not necessarily eternal duration. The anapausis in Rev 14:13 characterizes the rest state of the dead (consistent with the sleep/rest imagery for death throughout Scripture).

## Word Study Insights

### Basanismos (G929): Not Exclusively "Eternal Conscious Torment"

Basanismos occurs 6 times, all in Revelation. Three describe a completed destruction event (Babylon). One describes a temporary affliction (Rev 9:5, five months). The word describes the experience of undergoing judgment, not necessarily a permanent conscious state. Its same-book usage for Babylon's destruction is the controlling context for Rev 14:11.

### Basanizo (G928): Wide Semantic Range

The verb basanizo occurs 12 times and covers: physical illness (Matt 8:6), a boat tossed by waves (Matt 14:24), physical effort/toiling (Mark 6:48), emotional distress (2 Pet 2:8), labor pains (Rev 12:2), demonic fear (Matt 8:29), and divine judgment (Rev 14:10; 20:10). The word describes any form of distress or affliction, not exclusively eternal conscious torment.

### Anapausis (G372): Rest/Cessation -- Quality of Activity

All 5 NT occurrences: spiritual rest for souls (Matt 11:29), unclean spirit seeking rest (Matt 12:43; Luke 11:24), living creatures' ceaseless praise (Rev 4:8), beast-worshippers' judgment (Rev 14:11). The Rev 4:8 usage demonstrates that "no anapausis day and night" characterizes the uninterrupted nature of an activity during its execution.

### Kapnos (G2586): Smoke in Same-Book Context

All 13 occurrences are in Acts (1, quoting Joel) or Revelation (12). In Revelation, smoke appears in theophany (8:4; 15:8), judgment (9:2,17,18; 14:11; 18:9,18; 19:3). The Babylon smoke passages (18:9,18; 19:3) describe the smoke of a completed destruction observed by onlookers -- the same function smoke serves in Gen 19:28 and Isa 34:10.

### Theion (G2303): Brimstone -- Agent of Destruction

All 7 NT occurrences. The only non-Revelation use (Luke 17:29) describes Sodom's destruction: "destroyed them all." The OT equivalent (gophriyth, H1614, 7 occurrences) functions as an agent of destruction and desolation in every instance. No occurrence of brimstone in either testament describes ongoing conscious torment.

## Difficult Passages

### The Surface Reading of Rev 14:10-11

Read in isolation from its OT source imagery, Rev 14:10-11 appears to describe ongoing conscious torment: "tormented with fire and brimstone... smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever... no rest day nor night." The ECT reading of this passage carries force from the surface language.

The text under analysis:
- Rev 14:10 uses basanizo ("tormented"), not a destruction verb.
- Rev 14:11 describes "smoke of their torment" -- not smoke of their destruction.
- "No rest day nor night" parallels conscious activity.

Against this surface reading, the analysis identifies:
1. The OT source (Isa 34:10) uses the identical formula for a demonstrably completed judgment.
2. Same-book usage: basanismos describes Babylon's completed destruction (Rev 18:7,10,15).
3. Same-book usage: "rest not day and night" describes continuous activity in Rev 4:8.
4. The fire-and-brimstone paradigm from Gen 19 through every OT occurrence describes destruction.
5. The genre is apocalyptic vision (Tree 3 Gate 3).
6. Rev 19:3 uses the same formula for destroyed Babylon.
7. Rev 20:9 uses "devoured" for human enemies, while 20:10 uses "tormented" for the devil and symbolic entities.

The passage states what it states. The question is whether the OT background, the same-book context, and the genre govern the interpretation of the surface language.

### Rev 20:10 and the "Day and Night For Ever and Ever" Language

Rev 20:10 is the passage with the strongest surface-level ECT language: "tormented day and night for ever and ever." The subjects are the devil, the beast, and the false prophet.

The beast and false prophet are symbolic entities (E205). The devil is a non-human spirit being. No literal human is a subject of Rev 20:10. The immediately preceding verse (20:9) describes human enemies being "devoured" -- destruction vocabulary. The immediately following passage (20:14-15) describes humans entering the lake of fire under the designation "second death" -- death vocabulary.

The text distinguishes between these subjects. Whether the fate of the devil can be extended to all humans is not stated by the text; it must be inferred.

### The "Ages of Ages" Formula for God vs. for Judgment

The "eis tous aionas ton aionon" formula is used ~19 times for God/Christ (Rev 1:6; 4:9; 5:13; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 15:7; 22:5, etc.) and 3 times in judgment contexts (Rev 14:11; 19:3; 20:10). When applied to God, the formula carries its maximal force because God is genuinely eternal. The question is whether the same formula automatically carries identical force when applied to judgment.

The OT evidence from etc-07 and etc-08 demonstrates that "forever" vocabulary carries duration determined by its subject: olam for God's reign (genuinely unending) vs. olam for a slave's service (one lifetime) vs. olam for Edom's smoke (ended). The same word carries different durations for different subjects.
