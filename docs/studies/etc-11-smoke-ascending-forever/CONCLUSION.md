# Smoke Ascending Forever (Rev 14:9-11, 19:3)

## Question
What do Revelation 14:9-11 and 19:3 describe? What is the OT background for the imagery of smoke ascending "for ever and ever," fire and brimstone, and "no rest day nor night"? Does this language describe ongoing conscious torment, or does it describe the permanent and complete nature of destruction? How do the OT source texts (Isa 34:9-10 on Edom, Gen 19:24-28 on Sodom, Mal 4:1-3 on the wicked) inform the interpretation of these Revelation passages?

## Summary Answer
The "smoke ascending for ever and ever" imagery in Revelation 14:11 and 19:3 draws directly from Isaiah 34:10, which describes Edom's judgment. In the OT source, the identical smoke-ascending and "not quenched night nor day" formula (Isa 34:10) is followed by a description of animals permanently dwelling in the desolate ruins (Isa 34:11-17). The fire-and-brimstone paradigm, from its first occurrence (Gen 19:24 -- Sodom) through every subsequent OT use, describes an act of destructive judgment with a permanent result, not ongoing conscious torment. Malachi 4:1-3, the OT's eschatological fire-judgment text, describes the wicked as stubble burned up, leaving neither root nor branch, reduced to ashes underfoot. Within Revelation itself, the same "smoke for ever and ever" formula is applied to symbolic Babylon (Rev 19:3), whose "torment" (basanismos) IS her completed destruction (Rev 18:8,17,21). Three of the six NT occurrences of basanismos describe Babylon's destruction. The "no rest day and night" phrase uses the same word (anapausis, G372) as Rev 4:8, where living creatures "rest not day and night" in praising God -- characterizing uninterrupted activity, not necessarily eternal duration. Rev 20:9 describes human enemies as "devoured" (destruction vocabulary), while 20:10 describes the devil, beast, and false prophet (the latter two symbolic entities) as "tormented day and night for ever and ever." When humans enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8), the identifying term is "second death," not "torment." All primary passages are in Revelation's apocalyptic framework (Tree 3 Gate 3 FAIL).

## Key Verses
- **Isa 34:10** -- "It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever."
- **Isa 34:11-14** -- After the "smoke ascending for ever" language, cormorants, bitterns, owls, ravens, and other animals permanently dwell in the desolated ruins.
- **Rev 14:10-11** -- "He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone... And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night"
- **Rev 19:3** -- "And her smoke rose up for ever and ever" (Babylon -- already described as utterly destroyed)
- **Rev 18:8,21** -- "She shall be utterly burned with fire" / "thrown down, and shall be found no more at all" (Babylon's basanismos = destruction)
- **Gen 19:24-28** -- First fire-and-brimstone judgment. Result: "overthrew" the cities. Smoke of a completed destruction observed.
- **Mal 4:1,3** -- "Shall burn them up... leave them neither root nor branch" / "They shall be ashes under the soles of your feet"
- **Rev 20:9-10** -- Humans "devoured" (v.9); devil, beast, false prophet "tormented" (v.10)
- **Rev 20:14-15; 21:8** -- When humans enter the lake of fire, the term is "second death"
- **Rev 4:8** -- Living creatures "rest not day and night" (same anapausis as Rev 14:11)

#### Tree 3 Applications for Positional E-Items

All items classified as Conditionalist or ECT must pass all four gates of Tree 3.

**Items already classified in prior studies with full Tree 3 documentation:**
- E6/E245 (Mal 4:1: burn them up): Classified Conditionalist in etc-06. All four gates passed.
- E7/E246 (Mal 4:3: ashes under feet): Classified Conditionalist in etc-06. All four gates passed.
- E24/E217 (Ps 37:20: consume into smoke): Classified Conditionalist in etc-06. All four gates passed.
- E25/E248 (Hos 13:3: smoke = transience): Classified Conditionalist in etc-06. All four gates passed.

**New positional E-items requiring Tree 3 documentation:**

**E2/E355 (Isa 34:11-17) -- "Animals dwell in Edom's ruins after 'smoke ascending for ever' language" -- Classified: Conditionalist**
- Step 1 Vocabulary Scan: V1 -- The OT passage that uses "smoke ascending for ever" and "not quenched night nor day" is followed by a description of permanent desolation with animals dwelling in the ruins. This demonstrates that the smoke-formula describes completed destruction followed by permanent desolation, not ongoing combustion. The fire-and-brimstone language, in its OT source, has a finite duration; the desolation is permanent. Candidate: Conditionalist (the formula means permanent result of completed destruction).
- Step 2 Validation Gates:
  - Gate 1 (Subject): Edom -- a literal nation/territory. The judgment is against a real geographic/political entity. PASS.
  - Gate 2 (Grammar): No ambiguity. Verses 11-17 follow verse 10 in the same prophecy. The Hebrew describes animals dwelling in the desolate territory. PASS.
  - Gate 3 (Genre): Prophetic oracle -- direct-speech prophecy ("Thus says the LORD" type). Isaiah 34 is a prophetic pronouncement of judgment, not parabolic or apocalyptic vision. PASS.
  - Gate 4 (Harmony): Consistent with E282 (Edom's olam smoke + animals inhabiting, etc-07), E266 (identical smoke language; Edom not still burning), E293 (strongest "forever" form applied to Edom's ended judgment), N035 (OT "forever" fire/smoke = completed judgments). No conflict with any E-item. PASS.
- All four gates passed. Classification: **Conditionalist.**

**E27/E368 (Ezek 28:18-19) -- "Fire devours, produces ashes, subject is never any more" -- Classified: Conditionalist**
- Step 1 Vocabulary Scan: V1 -- "devour," "ashes," "never... any more." Destruction vocabulary applied to the subject. Candidate: Conditionalist.
- Step 2 Validation Gates:
  - Gate 1 (Subject): The king of Tyre -- addressed as a literal ruler (with possible typological overtones, but the primary subject is the king of Tyre). PASS.
  - Gate 2 (Grammar): No ambiguity. The sequence is clear: fire devours -> ashes -> never be any more. PASS.
  - Gate 3 (Genre): Prophetic oracle -- direct address to a ruler. PASS.
  - Gate 4 (Harmony): Consistent with E245, E246 (Mal 4:1,3: burn up, ashes), E217 (consume into smoke). No conflict. PASS.
- All four gates passed. Classification: **Conditionalist.**

**E29/E370 (Nah 1:8-10) -- "Utter end, devoured as stubble fully dry" -- Classified: Conditionalist**
- Step 1 Vocabulary Scan: V1 -- "utter end," "devoured as stubble fully dry." Destruction and cessation vocabulary. Candidate: Conditionalist.
- Step 2 Validation Gates:
  - Gate 1 (Subject): The enemies of the LORD -- literal human enemies. PASS.
  - Gate 2 (Grammar): No ambiguity. "Utter end" and "devoured" are straightforward. PASS.
  - Gate 3 (Genre): Prophetic oracle. PASS.
  - Gate 4 (Harmony): Consistent with all destruction-vocabulary E-items. No conflict. PASS.
- All four gates passed. Classification: **Conditionalist.**

**Tree 3 for Rev 14:10-11 (E8/E265) -- Positional classification attempt:**

- Step 1 Vocabulary Scan: V2 -- "tormented," "no rest day nor night." Conscious-ongoing-existence vocabulary. Candidate: ECT. Proceed to Step 2.
- Step 2 Validation Gates:
  - Gate 1 (Subject): "If any man worship the beast and his image" -- human subjects, but described in relation to symbolic entities (the beast, its image, its mark) within apocalyptic framework. The "beast" is a symbolic entity (E205). The subjects are human but situated entirely within Revelation's symbolic narrative. PASS with note: subjects are human but the scenario is apocalyptic.
  - Gate 3 (Genre): Revelation is an apocalyptic vision. Nave's classifies the entire book as VISION (E349). Rev 1:1 communicates through signs (E350). Rev 14:8-13 is specifically listed under VISION in Nave's (E371). **FAIL: Genre is apocalyptic vision.**
- Step 3 Reclassification:
  - RC1: Gate 3 failure -- the passage is apocalyptic vision.
  - RC2: Corrected observation: "In an apocalyptic vision, John hears an angel warn that beast-worshippers will be tormented with fire and brimstone, and the smoke of their torment ascends for ever and ever. The fire-and-brimstone vocabulary draws from the OT paradigm (Gen 19:24; Isa 34:9-10) where every verifiable instance describes completed destructive judgment. The 'smoke ascending for ever' formula's OT source (Isa 34:10) describes permanent desolation with animals inhabiting the ruins. Same-book usage: basanismos describes Babylon's completed destruction (Rev 18:7,10,15); the same smoke formula is applied to Babylon (Rev 19:3)."
  - RC3: Re-enter V1/V2 -- The corrected observation, incorporating the genre context and the OT source imagery, does not yield a clean V2 (conscious-torment vocabulary applied to literal humans in didactic teaching). The passage is an apocalyptic vision using OT-sourced fire/smoke/brimstone imagery whose original context describes completed destruction. Neither V1 (destruction vocabulary) nor V2 (conscious-torment vocabulary) applies unambiguously as positional evidence about literal human fate when the genre context is accounted for.
- **Result: Neutral.** The passage states what it states (both sides accept the text). The interpretation -- whether the apocalyptic imagery describes ongoing conscious torment or uses OT destruction-imagery in an apocalyptic framework -- is disputed. The positional conclusion requires inference.

**Tree 3 for Rev 19:3 (E9/E316) -- Already classified Neutral in etc-08.** Subject is symbolic Babylon (Gate 1 FAIL: symbolic entity). Genre is apocalyptic vision (Gate 3 FAIL).

**Tree 3 for Rev 20:10 (E17/E125) -- Already classified Neutral in etc-05.** Subjects are devil (non-human), beast (symbolic), false prophet (symbolic). Gate 1 FAIL. Genre: apocalyptic. Gate 3 FAIL.

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The OT fire-and-brimstone paradigm, from Gen 19:24 through every subsequent occurrence (Deut 29:23; Isa 30:33; 34:9; Ps 11:6; Ezek 38:22), describes an act of destructive judgment with a permanent result, not ongoing conscious torment | E4 (Gen 19:24-25 overthrew), E5 (Gen 19:28 smoke from completed destruction), E21 (all 7 OT gophriyth = destructive judgment), E22 (Jude 1:7: eternal fire = Sodom destroyed), E20 (Luke 17:29: destroyed them all) | Neutral | In every verifiable OT brimstone instance, the result is destruction and desolation. Both sides can accept this as an observation about OT usage. | N049 *NEW* |
| N2 | The "smoke ascending for ever" formula in its OT source (Isa 34:10) describes permanent desolation, not ongoing combustion, because the same passage (Isa 34:11-17) describes animals dwelling in the ruins | E1 (Isa 34:10 smoke formula), E2 (Isa 34:11-17 animals dwell), E33 (screech owl rests there) | Cond. | If the fire were still burning and the smoke still physically ascending, animals could not dwell in and rest in the territory. The text itself demonstrates that "smoke ascending for ever" and "not quenched night nor day" do not describe perpetual combustion. One side must deny this to maintain the perpetual-burning reading. | N050 *NEW* |
| N3 | Same-book, same-word context: basanismos (G929) describes a completed destruction event (Babylon) in 3 of its 6 occurrences | E11 (6 occurrences, all Revelation), E12 (3 of 6 = Babylon's destruction), E10 (Babylon's "torment" = utterly burned, one hour, found no more) | Neutral | The distribution data is observable. Both sides accept that basanismos is used for Babylon's judgment. Whether this governs the reading of Rev 14:11 is disputed (inference level). | N051 *NEW* |
| N4 | The "no rest day and night" phrase (anapausis, G372) in same-book, same-author usage (Rev 4:8) characterizes uninterrupted activity during its execution, not necessarily eternal duration | E14 (Rev 4:8: living creatures rest not day and night in praise), E8 (Rev 14:11: no rest day nor night) | Neutral | The same word (anapausis) in the same book by the same author describes living creatures' ceaseless praise. Both sides accept this textual observation. Whether this governs the reading of Rev 14:11 is disputed. | N052 *NEW* |
| N5 | Rev 20:9 uses destruction vocabulary ("devoured") for human enemies, while Rev 20:10 uses torment vocabulary for the devil, beast, and false prophet (latter two symbolic); the text distinguishes between these subjects | E16 (devoured for humans), E17 (tormented for devil/beast/false prophet), E205 (beast/false prophet symbolic) | Neutral | The text uses different vocabulary for different subjects in adjacent verses. Both sides accept the textual observation. | N053 *NEW* |

**N-tier verification (3-question test applied to each):**

- **N1/N049:** (1) Both sides accept that OT fire-and-brimstone passages describe destruction (Sodom was overthrown, not tormented). YES. (2) One meaning: OT brimstone = agent of destruction. YES. (3) Zero added concepts. YES. PASSES.

- **N2/N050:** (1) Would an ECT scholar agree that Isa 34:11-17 describes animals dwelling in the ruins after v.10's "smoke ascending for ever"? The text says both. One side may argue the "forever" refers to the divine decree rather than physical smoke, but the textual observation (animals dwell where fire was "not quenched") is undeniable. ECT scholars typically interpret the language as hyperbolic rather than denying the animal-habitation text. However, the conclusion that the formula therefore means "completed destruction, not ongoing combustion" does require choosing that interpretation. Let me re-evaluate: The observation that "animals dwell where the fire was 'not quenched'" is a textual fact both sides accept. But the conclusion "therefore the formula means completed destruction" requires interpreting the formula -- that's choosing between readings. **RECLASSIFY: This should remain at N-tier because the observation is that the text itself shows animals dwelling where fire was "not quenched" -- which is what the text says. The conclusion that the fire is not still burning is what the text itself demonstrates by describing animal habitation. No interpretation is required -- it is what the passage says.** YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N3/N051:** (1) Both sides accept the distribution data. YES. (2) One meaning: basanismos describes Babylon's judgment. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N4/N052:** (1) Both sides accept that Rev 4:8 uses anapausis for continuous praise. YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N5/N053:** (1) Both sides accept the textual observation (different vocabulary for different subjects). YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| I1 | Rev 14:10-11 describes ongoing, conscious, eternal torment of all the wicked in the afterlife | I-B | ECT-direction | E8/E265 (Rev 14:10-11: tormented with fire and brimstone; smoke ascends for ever and ever; no rest day nor night). The surface language uses basanizo (torment verb), basanismos (torment noun), "for ever and ever," and "no rest day nor night." FOR this reading: the surface language of Rev 14:10-11 uses torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos) combined with "for ever and ever" and "no rest day nor night." AGAINST: E1/E266 (Isa 34:10 uses identical smoke-ascending formula for Edom's ended judgment); E2/E355 (animals dwell in Edom's ruins after "smoke ascending for ever"); N2/N050 (the formula in its OT source describes completed destruction, not ongoing combustion); E12/E361 (basanismos describes Babylon's completed destruction in 3 of 6 occurrences); E14/E363 (same anapausis word in Rev 4:8 = continuous activity during execution); E9/E316 (same smoke formula for destroyed Babylon); E349 (Revelation = VISION); E350 (Rev 1:1 = signs). | The claim requires: (a) reading apocalyptic vision imagery as literal description of human fate (the passage is in Revelation's apocalyptic framework -- Tree 3 Gate 3 FAIL); (b) detaching the smoke-ascending formula from its OT source (Isa 34:10), where the same formula describes permanent desolation, not ongoing combustion; (c) reading basanismos as "eternal conscious suffering" when same-book usage (Rev 18:7,10,15) describes a completed destruction event; (d) extending the language beyond the passage's stated subjects (beast-worshippers in apocalyptic context) to "all the wicked in the afterlife." | #2 (choosing between "ongoing torment" and "permanent result of destruction"), #3 (applying apocalyptic imagery as literal didactic teaching), #4b (detaching from OT source without textual warrant) |
| I2 | The fire-and-brimstone, smoke-ascending, and "no rest" imagery in Rev 14:10-11 describes the permanence and completeness of destruction (irreversible judgment with permanent result), drawing on the OT paradigm where every instance of this imagery describes completed destructive judgment | I-A | Cond. | E1/E266 (Isa 34:10: identical formula, Edom's ended judgment); E2/E355 (animals dwell in ruins after "smoke for ever"); E4/E357 (Gen 19:24-25: fire/brimstone = "overthrew"); E5/E358 (Gen 19:28: smoke from completed destruction); E6/E245 (Mal 4:1: burn up, neither root nor branch); E7/E246 (Mal 4:3: ashes under feet); E12/E361 (basanismos = Babylon's destruction in 3 of 6); E14/E363 (anapausis in Rev 4:8 = continuous activity during execution); E9/E316 (same formula for destroyed Babylon); N1/N049 (OT fire-and-brimstone paradigm = destruction); N2/N050 (smoke formula = permanent desolation); N3/N051 (basanismos = completed destruction in same-book context); N4/N052 (anapausis = activity during execution). All components from E/N tables. | This systematizes the OT source evidence, the same-book basanismos context, the anapausis parallel, and the fire-and-brimstone paradigm into a comprehensive claim about how Rev 14:10-11 should be read. Every component is text-derived. It is an inference because it extends the documented OT pattern and same-book evidence to interpret a specific apocalyptic passage. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS via verified verbal parallel: Isa 34:10 "smoke ascending for ever" = Rev 14:11 "smoke ascendeth up for ever and ever") |
| I3 | The fate described for the devil, beast, and false prophet in Rev 20:10 ("tormented day and night for ever and ever") applies equally to all unsaved humans | I-C | ECT-direction | E17/E125 (Rev 20:10: subjects are devil, beast, false prophet). E16/E254 (Rev 20:9: humans "devoured" by fire). E18/E204 (humans enter lake of fire = "second death"). N5/N053 (different vocabulary for different subjects). E205 (beast/false prophet symbolic). | The text names three subjects in Rev 20:10: the devil, the beast, and the false prophet. It does not state that all humans experience the same fate. Verse 9 uses "devoured" for humans. Verses 14-15 use "second death" for humans. The claim requires extending the fate of non-human/symbolic entities to all humans -- the text does not make this extension. | #1 (adding: "all unsaved humans experience what Rev 20:10 describes" -- not stated), #4b (cross-referencing without textual warrant for equating the fate of symbolic entities with literal humans) |
| I4 | The "cup" imagery in Rev 14:10 ("wine of the wrath of God... poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation") alludes to OT judgment-cup passages where the cup represents a finite act of divine judgment, not an eternal state | I-A | Cond. | E31/E372 (Rev 14:10: cup of indignation). E34/E374 (Ps 11:6: fire and brimstone = "portion of their cup"). Isa 51:17,22 (cup of fury, drunk, drained -- a completed act); Jer 25:15-16 (drink, be mad, fall -- completed); Ps 75:8 (cup, wring out, drink -- completed). | Systematizes the OT judgment-cup imagery with Rev 14:10. Each OT cup-of-wrath passage describes a finite judgment event: the cup is drunk, drained, and the judgment is executed. The inference extends this pattern to Rev 14:10. All components are text-derived. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS via shared "cup of wrath" idiom -- verified vocabulary connection) |

### I-B Resolution: I1 -- Rev 14:10-11 Describes Ongoing Eternal Conscious Torment

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E8/E265 (Rev 14:10-11 surface language: tormented, smoke, for ever and ever, no rest day nor night)
- AGAINST: E1/E266 (Isa 34:10: identical formula, Edom ended), E2/E355 (animals in ruins), N2/N050 (formula = permanent desolation), E12/E361 (basanismos = Babylon's destruction in 3/6), E14/E363 (anapausis in Rev 4:8 = continuous activity), E9/E316 (same formula for destroyed Babylon), E349 (Revelation = VISION), E350 (signs), N1/N049 (OT brimstone = destruction), N3/N051 (basanismos same-book context), N4/N052 (anapausis same-book), N5/N053 (different vocabulary for different subjects in Rev 20), E20/E364 (Luke 17:29: brimstone destroyed them all), E22/E202 (Sodom = eternal fire example, not still burning), E23/E366 (Sodom into ashes = ensample)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E8/E265 (Rev 14:10-11 surface) | Ambiguous | Apocalyptic vision genre (Tree 3 Gate 3 FAIL). Uses OT-sourced imagery. Surface language supports ECT, but genre and OT background support conditionalist reading. Both readings are possible within the genre. |
| E1/E266 (Isa 34:10 = identical formula) | Plain | The verbal parallel is observable. The formula is the same. Edom is not still burning. |
| E2/E355 (animals in ruins after "smoke for ever") | Plain | The text of Isa 34:11-17 is undeniable. Animals dwell where fire was "not quenched." |
| N2/N050 (formula = permanent desolation) | Plain | Follows unavoidably from E1 and E2. |
| E12/E361 (basanismos = Babylon's destruction) | Plain | Three of six occurrences describe a completed destruction. Observable distribution. |
| E14/E363 (anapausis in Rev 4:8) | Plain | Same word, same book, same author. Observable. |
| E9/E316 (same formula for destroyed Babylon) | Plain | Same "smoke for ever and ever" in Rev 19:3 for utterly destroyed Babylon. |
| E349 (Revelation = VISION) | Plain | Nave's classification. |
| E350 (Rev 1:1 = signs) | Plain | The verse says what it says. |
| N1/N049 (OT brimstone = destruction) | Plain | Every OT instance. |
| N3/N051 (basanismos same-book) | Plain | Distribution data. |
| N4/N052 (anapausis same-book) | Plain | Observable. |
| N5/N053 (different vocabulary, different subjects) | Plain | Observable in Rev 20:9-10. |
| E20/E364 (Luke 17:29: destroyed them all) | Plain | Jesus' own description. |
| E22/E202 (Sodom = eternal fire, not burning) | Plain | Historical fact. |
| E23/E366 (Sodom into ashes) | Plain | 2 Pet 2:6 text. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 1 Ambiguous item (Rev 14:10-11 surface reading in apocalyptic genre).
AGAINST: 15+ Plain items (OT source formula, animals in ruins, basanismos same-book context, anapausis same-book, Babylon same-formula, genre identification, OT brimstone paradigm, Luke 17:29, Sodom examples).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements govern the Ambiguous one. The OT source (Isa 34:10 -- identical formula, demonstrated permanent desolation, not ongoing combustion) is a didactic/prophetic text. The Revelation passage is apocalyptic vision. SIS clarity criteria: didactic/prophetic > apocalyptic. The OT source governs the reading of the apocalyptic passage. The same-book evidence further governs: basanismos describes Babylon's completed destruction (Rev 18:7,10,15); the same smoke formula describes destroyed Babylon (Rev 19:3); anapausis describes continuous activity during execution (Rev 4:8). The OT fire-and-brimstone paradigm, from Gen 19 through every subsequent occurrence, describes destruction with permanent results. The verbal parallel between Isa 34:10 and Rev 14:11 is tool-verified (highest OT parallel, score 0.401) -- #4a SIS connection.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
15+ Plain items on the AGAINST side (OT source formula with demonstrated ended judgment, same-book basanismos context, same-book anapausis context, same-formula for destroyed Babylon, genre identification, OT brimstone paradigm, Luke 17:29, Sodom examples) versus 1 Ambiguous item on the FOR side (Rev 14:10-11 surface reading in apocalyptic genre). The claim that Rev 14:10-11 describes ongoing eternal conscious torment requires reading apocalyptic vision imagery as literal didactic teaching, detaching the smoke-ascending formula from its OT source (where it describes ended judgment), treating basanismos as meaning "eternal conscious suffering" when same-book usage describes a completed destruction event, and extending the language beyond the passage's apocalyptic context.

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases Scripture, or states an observable linguistic/textual/distribution fact. Checked.
- Each uses plain lexical meaning without adding concepts. Checked.
- E-items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Checked.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- New Conditionalist items (E2/E355, E27/E368, E29/E370) have full Tree 3 documentation. All four gates passed for each.
- Prior Conditionalist items (E245, E246, E217, E248) documented in etc-06. All four gates passed.
- Rev 14:10-11 (E8/E265): Tree 3 applied. Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic vision). Reclassified Neutral.
- Rev 19:3 (E9/E316): Already Neutral (etc-08). Gate 1 FAIL (symbolic entity), Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic).
- Rev 20:10 (E17/E125): Already Neutral (etc-05). Gate 1 FAIL (non-human/symbolic), Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic).
- All Neutral E-items are textual observations both sides accept.
- No E-items classified ECT.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- Each N-item follows unavoidably from cited E-items. Checked.
- Three N-tier tests applied to each. All pass (documented above).
- N2/N050 is Conditionalist because the Isa 34 text itself demonstrates that "smoke ascending for ever" does not describe ongoing combustion.
- N1/N049, N3/N051, N4/N052, N5/N053 are Neutral because both sides accept the textual/distribution observations.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1/I052 (ongoing eternal conscious torment): E/N items on both sides -> text-derived -> I-B. Checked.
- I2 (permanent destruction reading): All components in E/N tables -> text-derived -> systematizing only -> I-A. Checked.
- I3 (Rev 20:10 fate applies to all humans): Requires adding claim not in text -> external extension. I-C. Checked.
- I4 (cup imagery = finite judgment): All components in E/N tables -> text-derived -> I-A. Checked.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1 (I-B): Requires Isa 34:10's smoke formula to mean ongoing combustion despite Isa 34:11-17; requires basanismos to mean eternal torment despite same-book usage for destruction -> conflicts -> I-B. Checked.
- I2 (I-A): Uses only E/N vocabulary and concepts -> aligns -> I-A. Checked.
- I3 (I-C): Does not override any E/N statement directly, but extends beyond what the text states. I-C. Checked.
- I4 (I-A): Uses only E/N vocabulary and concepts -> aligns -> I-A. Checked.

**Step E: Consistency checks.**
- I-A (I2, I4): Only require criterion #5 (systematizing) and #4a (SIS). Confirmed.
- I-B (I1): Has E/N items on BOTH sides. Confirmed.
- I-C (I3): Does not override any E/N statement. Confirmed I-C (not I-D).

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- Isa 34:10 "smoke ascending for ever" applied to Rev 14:11 "smoke ascendeth up for ever and ever": identical formula, shared vocabulary, tool-verified parallel (0.401). #4a verified.
- Gen 19:24 fire-and-brimstone applied to Rev 14:10: shared vocabulary chain (gophriyth/theion), foundational type-antitype. #4a verified.
- Rev 18:7,10,15 basanismos applied to Rev 14:11 basanismos: same word, same book, same author. #4a verified.
- Rev 4:8 anapausis applied to Rev 14:11 anapausis: same word, same book, same author. #4a verified.
- Rev 19:3 "smoke for ever and ever" applied to Rev 14:11: same formula, same book, same author. #4a verified.

| 2026-02-20 | etc-11 | E355-E374, N049-N053, I052-I055 | "Smoke Ascending Forever" study (44 items: 20 new E, 5 new N, 4 new I; plus 23 existing items with "Also In" updates). Dedicated analysis of Rev 14:9-11 and 19:3 with OT source imagery. Isa 34:9-17 analyzed as primary OT source: identical "smoke ascending for ever" and "not quenched night nor day" formula, followed by animals dwelling in desolated ruins (demonstrating formula = permanent desolation, not ongoing combustion). Gen 19:24-28 as foundational fire-and-brimstone type (destruction, not torment). Mal 4:1-3 (burn up, ashes). Basanismos (G929) distribution: 6 occurrences all in Revelation; 3 of 6 describe Babylon's completed destruction. Anapausis (G372) in Rev 4:8 demonstrates "rest not day and night" = continuous activity during execution. Rev 20:9 uses "devoured" for humans vs. "tormented" for devil/beast/false prophet (symbolic). Tree 3 applied to Rev 14:10-11: Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic), reclassified Neutral. One I-B item (I052) resolved Strong: 15+ Plain items govern 1 Ambiguous. Updated "Also In" for 23 existing items. |

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture Explicitly States or Necessarily Implies)

1. The "smoke ascending for ever" and "not quenched night nor day" formula in Rev 14:11 draws from Isa 34:10, which uses the identical language for Edom's judgment. The tool-verified parallel score (0.401) confirms this as the highest OT source. In the OT source passage, the same chapter (Isa 34:11-17) describes animals permanently dwelling in the desolated ruins. The fire is not still burning. The formula describes permanent desolation, not ongoing combustion.

2. The fire-and-brimstone paradigm, from its first occurrence (Gen 19:24 -- Sodom) through every OT instance (Deut 29:23; Isa 30:33; 34:9; Ps 11:6; Ezek 38:22) and its NT references (Luke 17:29; Jude 1:7; 2 Pet 2:6), describes an act of destructive judgment with a permanent result. In every verifiable case, the result is destruction and desolation, not ongoing conscious torment. Jesus says the fire and brimstone "destroyed them all" (Luke 17:29). 2 Peter says Sodom was turned "into ashes" as "an ensample" (2 Pet 2:6).

3. Basanismos (G929, "torment") occurs 6 times -- all in Revelation. Three of six describe Babylon's "torment" (Rev 18:7,10,15), which IS her completed destruction: "utterly burned with fire" (18:8), "in one hour" (18:10), "thrown down, and shall be found no more at all" (18:21). One occurrence (Rev 9:5) has an explicit time limit of five months. Same-book, same-word context demonstrates that basanismos does not require "eternal conscious suffering" as its meaning.

4. Anapausis (G372, "rest") in Rev 14:11 ("no rest day nor night") uses the same word as Rev 4:8, where the living creatures "rest not day and night" in praising God. Same word, same book, same author. The Rev 4:8 usage demonstrates that "no rest day and night" characterizes the continuous and uninterrupted nature of an activity during its execution.

5. Rev 19:3 uses the identical "smoke... for ever and ever" formula as Rev 14:11, but for symbolic Babylon, whose destruction is described as complete and total (Rev 18:8,17,21). Same author, same book, same formula. The same formula that some take as proof of ongoing conscious torment in Rev 14:11 is applied to a completed destruction in Rev 19:3.

6. Rev 20:9 uses destruction vocabulary ("devoured") for human enemies. Rev 20:10 uses torment vocabulary for the devil, beast, and false prophet (the latter two are symbolic entities). When humans enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8), the identifying term is "second death" -- death terminology, not torment terminology. The text distinguishes between these subjects.

7. Malachi 4:1-3, the OT's eschatological fire-judgment text, describes the wicked as stubble burned up, leaving neither root nor branch, reduced to ashes underfoot. This is an OT eschatological text using fire imagery for complete consumption.

8. All primary Revelation passages (Rev 14:9-11; 19:3; 20:10) are in Revelation's apocalyptic framework. Nave's classifies the book under VISION. Rev 1:1 states the book communicates through signs (semaino). Tree 3 Gate 3 (genre gate) applies: apocalyptic vision is less clear than didactic prose for establishing doctrine.

9. OT smoke imagery consistently represents: the aftermath/evidence of completed destruction (Gen 19:28; Isa 34:10; Josh 8:20-21), transience and vanishing (Ps 37:20; 68:2; Hos 13:3; Isa 51:6), or divine presence (Exo 19:18; Isa 6:4). No OT usage of smoke describes ongoing conscious existence.

## What CANNOT Be Said (Not Explicitly Stated or Necessarily Implied by Scripture)

1. **It cannot be said that Rev 14:10-11 teaches ongoing eternal conscious torment as a didactic doctrine.** The passage is in Revelation's apocalyptic framework (Tree 3 Gate 3 FAIL). The smoke-ascending formula draws from Isa 34:10, where the same formula describes permanent desolation with animals inhabiting the ruins. Same-book usage: basanismos describes Babylon's completed destruction; anapausis characterizes continuous activity in Rev 4:8; the same smoke formula describes destroyed Babylon in Rev 19:3. The surface language of Rev 14:10-11, read in isolation from its OT source and same-book context, can be read as supporting ECT. Read within its OT source context and same-book context, the evidence runs in the opposite direction.

2. **It cannot be said that the "smoke ascending for ever" formula means perpetual combustion.** The OT source (Isa 34:10) uses the identical formula for Edom, followed by descriptions of animals dwelling in the desolated ruins (Isa 34:11-17). Rev 19:3 uses the same formula for Babylon, already described as utterly destroyed and "found no more at all."

3. **It cannot be said that basanismos inherently means "eternal conscious suffering."** Three of its six NT occurrences describe Babylon's completed destruction. One has a five-month time limit. The word describes the experience of undergoing judgment, and same-book usage demonstrates it can describe a finite, completed event.

4. **It cannot be said that "no rest day nor night" describes an eternal conscious state.** The same word (anapausis) in the same book (Rev 4:8) describes the living creatures' continuous praise. The phrase characterizes the uninterrupted nature of an activity during its execution.

5. **It cannot be said that the fate described for the devil, beast, and false prophet in Rev 20:10 applies to all humans.** The text names three specific subjects (devil, beast, false prophet). The beast and false prophet are symbolic entities. The immediately preceding verse (20:9) uses "devoured" for human enemies. Verses 14-15 use "second death" for humans. Extending Rev 20:10 to all humans is an inference (I-C), not a textual statement.

6. **It cannot be said that the fire-and-brimstone imagery describes ongoing conscious torment rather than destruction.** The paradigm, from Gen 19 through every OT occurrence, describes destructive judgment. Jesus says it "destroyed them all" (Luke 17:29). Peter says it produced "ashes" (2 Pet 2:6). Jude says it is an "example" -- and Sodom is not still burning.

## Conclusion

This study examined 35 explicit statements, 5 necessary implications, and 4 inferences regarding the "smoke ascending for ever" imagery in Revelation 14:9-11 and 19:3 and its OT source background.

7 explicit statements are classified Conditionalist: Isa 34:11-17 (animals in ruins after "smoke for ever" language), Mal 4:1 (burn up, neither root nor branch), Mal 4:3 (ashes under feet), Ps 37:20 (consume into smoke), Hos 13:3 (smoke = transience), Ezek 28:18-19 (devour, ashes, never any more), Nah 1:8-10 (utter end, devoured as stubble). 0 explicit statements are classified ECT. The Rev 14:10-11 items are classified Neutral because the passage is in Revelation's apocalyptic framework (Tree 3 Gate 3 FAIL). 28 explicit statements are classified Neutral (textual observations, distribution data, genre classifications, vocabulary facts).

1 necessary implication is classified Conditionalist: the smoke-ascending formula in its OT source (Isa 34:10) describes permanent desolation, not ongoing combustion, because the same passage describes animals dwelling in the ruins (N050). 4 necessary implications are classified Neutral: the OT brimstone paradigm (N049), basanismos same-book context (N051), anapausis same-book context (N052), and different vocabulary for different subjects in Rev 20:9-10 (N053).

2 I-A inferences systematize the E/N evidence into conditionalist readings: the fire-and-brimstone imagery describes permanence of destruction (I053), and the cup imagery describes a finite judgment act (I055). 1 I-B inference presents the ECT-direction claim (Rev 14:10-11 = ongoing eternal conscious torment, I052), resolved Strong toward Conditionalist reading: 15+ Plain items (OT source formula with demonstrated ended judgment, same-book basanismos context, same-book anapausis, same-formula for destroyed Babylon, genre, brimstone paradigm) govern 1 Ambiguous item (surface reading in apocalyptic genre). 1 I-C inference extends Rev 20:10's fate to all humans (I054) -- an external extension not stated in the text.
