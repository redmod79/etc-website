## Answer to the Study Question

**What does "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" (Rev 14:11) mean?**

The formula "smoke ascending for ever and ever" is drawn from Isaiah 34:10 (tool-verified as the #1 OT parallel for Rev 14:11, score 0.401) — a prophecy of Edom's desolation whose aftermath (described in Isa 34:11-17) is a permanently abandoned wasteland inhabited by wild animals, not an ongoing burning landscape. The formula describes the permanent, irrevocable character of the destruction, not an ongoing burning process with conscious persons continuing to experience torment.

This reading is confirmed within Revelation itself: Revelation 19:3 uses the grammatically identical formula (kapnos + anabainei + eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn) for Babylon's smoke — applied to a city described in the preceding chapter as destroyed "in one hour" (Rev 18:17,19) and "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21). The same author, in the same book, demonstrates that the formula can describe the permanent aftermath of completed destruction.

**What does Revelation 19:3 mean when it says Babylon's "smoke rose up for ever and ever"?**

It announces the permanent, irrevocable character of Babylon's completed destruction. The smoke that "rises up for ever and ever" is the eternal marker of the judgment already executed — not evidence of ongoing burning. Babylon is "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21).

**Does "smoke ascending for ever" describe ongoing conscious torment, or the permanent/complete nature of the destruction?**

The convergent evidence — the Isa 34:10 OT source (desolation), the Rev 19:3 within-book parallel (completed destruction), the basanismos distribution in Revelation (Rev 9:5 = five months; Rev 18:7,10,15 = one-hour completed event), the Rev 4:8 anapausis parallel (same phrase = unceasing activity not suffering), and the N029 eternal-fire precedent (Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6 = ashes) — all point toward the permanent/complete nature of the destruction.

IB009 is upgraded from Moderate to **Strong** resolution (weight toward literary formula / permanent-desolation imagery) based on the Rev 19:3 within-book structural parallel.

## New Evidence Items from This Study

### New Explicit Statement (E) Items

| ID | Explicit Statement | Reference | Classification |
|----|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| E250 | Revelation 19:3 uses the grammatically identical formula as Rev 14:11: καὶ ὁ καπνὸς αὐτῆς ἀναβαίνει εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων — kapnos (G2586) + anabainei (Pres Act Ind 3S) + eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn — applied to Babylon. The pronoun αὐτῆς (Gen Sg Fem) refers to Babylon (grammatically feminine). Rev 18 describes Babylon as destroyed "in one hour" (18:10,17,19) and "shall be found no more at all" (18:21). Rev 19:2 announces the judgment as complete: "he hath judged" (ekrina, Aorist). | Rev 19:3; Rev 18:10,21; Rev 19:2 (Greek parsing confirmed) | Neutral |
| E251 | G929 (basanismos = torment) in Rev 9:5 describes the scorpion-sting torment of the fifth trumpet judgment, explicitly limited to "five months" by the text (vv.5,10: "their torment was as the torment of a scorpion...and their torment was five months"). The same torment noun used in Rev 14:11 for the beast-worshippers also describes a bounded, finite-duration judgment within Revelation. | Rev 9:5, 9:10 (G929 basanismos with explicit five-month temporal boundary) | Neutral |
| E252 | G929 (basanismos) appears three times in Rev 18 describing Babylon's judicial destruction: (a) Rev 18:7 "give her torment and sorrow"; (b) Rev 18:10 "for in one hour is thy judgment come" (in context of torment vocabulary); (c) Rev 18:15 "shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment." All three uses describe an event characterized as sudden ("in one hour" — vv.10,17,19) and as a completed judicial act. The same noun used in Rev 14:11 describes this finite, completed judgment event. | Rev 18:7; 18:10; 18:15 (G929 basanismos in context of "in one hour is thy judgment come") | Neutral |
| E253 | Revelation 4:8 and Revelation 14:11 use the grammatically identical Greek phrase: ἀνάπαυσιν οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός — "rest they have not day and night." In Rev 4:8, this describes the four living creatures ceaselessly worshipping before God ("saying, Holy, holy, holy"). In Rev 14:11, it describes beast-worshippers. Same noun (G372 anapausis, Acc Sg Fem), same negation (ouk), same verb (ekhousin, Pres Act Ind 3P), same genitive time expression (hēmeras kai nyktos). Greek parsing confirmed by tool. | Rev 4:8; Rev 14:11 (grammatical identity confirmed by greek-parsing.md tool data) | Neutral |
| E254 | Genesis 19:28: "And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah...and, lo, the smoke [H6227, ashan] of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace." Abraham sees this smoke the morning after the destruction (compare Gen 19:24: the rain of brimstone and fire; Gen 19:28: the morning-after smoke). The smoke is a residue visible after the destruction is complete — not evidence of ongoing burning of conscious persons. | Gen 19:28 (H6227 ashan; temporal context: morning after destruction) | Neutral |
| E255 | H6227 (ashan, Hebrew "smoke") is rendered by the LXX as G2586 (kapnos, Greek "smoke") as its dominant primary translation: count 20, PMI 9.95, ranked score 30.28 (from LXX mapping data, search_strongs.py --lxx-map H6227). This confirms that the Revelation author's use of kapnos (G2586) in Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3 corresponds lexically to the Hebrew ashan (H6227) used in Isaiah 34:10's smoke-for-ever prophecy. The LXX bridge connects the Revelation formula directly to its Hebrew source. | LXX mapping data: H6227 → G2586 (ashan → kapnos); Isa 34:10 (H6227); Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3 (G2586) | Neutral |
| E256 | The formula "for ever and ever" (eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn, using G165 twice) appears in Revelation distributed as follows: approximately 11 applications to God, Christ, and the redeemed (whose existence is inherently without end: Rev 1:6; 4:9; 4:10; 5:13; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 15:3; 15:7; 22:5), and 3 applications in judgment contexts (Rev 14:11: beast-worshippers' smoke; Rev 19:3: Babylon's smoke; Rev 20:10: devil/beast/false prophet tormented). | Rev 1:6; 4:9; 4:10; 5:13; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 14:11; 15:3; 15:7; 19:3; 20:10; 22:5 (G165 distribution in Revelation) | Neutral |
| E257 | Revelation 18:21: "And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and **shall be found no more at all**." The permanent cessation of Babylon is declared by symbolic prophetic act immediately before Rev 19:3 applies the smoke-for-ever formula to Babylon. | Rev 18:21 (millstone sign: permanent removal; "shall be found no more at all") | Neutral |
| E258 | Revelation 14:11-13: within a three-verse unit, G372 anapausis ("rest" — negated: "no rest") for beast-worshippers (v.11) is immediately followed by G373 anapauō (anapausōntai, same root) for the blessed dead who "rest from their labours" (v.13). The same Greek root appears as negated absence (v.11) and affirmed presence (v.13) within the same literary unit. | Rev 14:11 (anapausin ouk ekhousin); Rev 14:13 (anapausōntai, Aor Mid Subj 3P — same root G373) | Neutral |

### New Necessary Implication (N) Items

No new N items are added in this study. The key implications are already covered:
- N029 (eternal fire = permanent result) *(reclassified to IB009-resolved after Study 5)* — established in etc5-05
- N034 (olam duration contextually determined) — established in etc5-07
- N035 (aionios inherits olam semantic range) — established in etc5-07

### New Inference-A (I-A) Items

No new I-A items are added in this study. The relevant systematic conclusions are covered by existing items (IA019, IA020, IA021) and the upgraded IB009.

### New Inference-B (I-B) Items

| ID | Claim | FOR | AGAINST | Resolution |
|----|-------|-----|---------|------------|
| IB014 | The phrase "they have no rest day nor night" (anapausin ouk ekhousin hēmeras kai nyktos, Rev 14:11) describes either (a) ongoing perpetual conscious suffering without any intermission [ECT reading], or (b) the unceasing, all-consuming character of the judgment process that admits no respite until it is complete, consistent with how the identical phrase in Rev 4:8 describes the living creatures' continuous activity [desolation reading]. | FOR ongoing suffering: E150 (Rev 14:10-11: explicit torment language applied to beast-worshippers; "no rest day nor night" in context of "smoke of their torment"). Plain ECT statement. | AGAINST ongoing suffering / FOR judgment-process reading: E253 (Rev 4:8: same phrase, same author, same book = continuous worshipful activity, not suffering); E250 (Rev 19:3: same formula for Babylon = completed destruction); N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved)* (eternal-fire-to-ashes = permanent result). Also E258 (same root appears as "rest" for righteous dead in v.13 — the contrast of adjacent verses implies the "no rest" describes the nature of the judgment, as the righteous "rest" by contrast describes the nature of their outcome, not necessarily ongoing eternal activity). | **Moderate — weight toward judgment-process/permanent-destruction reading.** The Rev 4:8 SIS connection (same author, same book, identical phrase = unceasing activity without specifying ongoing conscious suffering) is a #4a SIS connection that prevents the phrase from being unambiguously read as specifying perpetual ongoing consciousness. Combined with Rev 19:3 (same formula = completed destruction), the "no rest day nor night" language is contextually resolved as characterizing the irreversible, unceasing judgment execution rather than necessarily specifying perpetual ongoing conscious experience. |

## IB009 Resolution Update

**Previous resolution:** Moderate — weight toward literary formula / permanent-desolation imagery (established etc5-06, confirmed etc5-07, etc5-08)

**New resolution: STRONG — weight toward literary formula / permanent-desolation imagery**

**Basis for upgrade from Moderate to Strong:**

The Rev 19:3 within-book structural parallel (E250, new) is a #4a SIS connection of the highest evidential caliber:
- Same author (John)
- Same book (Revelation)
- Identical Greek formula (confirmed by parsing tools: kapnos + anabainei + eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn)
- Demonstrably completed-destruction context (Babylon: "in one hour" destroyed; "found no more at all"; "he hath judged" in Aorist)

Within Revelation itself, the identical formula is applied to an entity that is not perpetually burning or perpetually suffering — it is permanently destroyed. This within-book demonstration means the formula cannot be read as *necessarily* implying ongoing conscious perpetual experience for the subject to whom it is applied.

**FOR literary formula/desolation — Plain items entering the upgrade assessment:**
1. Rev 19:3 (new E250): same formula, same book, completed destruction
2. N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved)*: eternal fire = permanent result (Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6 = ashes)
3. E147: Sodom eternal fire = ashes (Plain textual statement by same author tradition)

**FOR literary formula/desolation — Contextually Clear items:**
4. E182: Isa 34:10 = tool-confirmed #1 OT source text (score 0.401), describing desolated wasteland
5. E192: Isa 34:11-17 = animals in desolation immediately after smoke-for-ever announcement

**AGAINST (ongoing torment) — at Strong assessment:**
The primary AGAINST item is E150 (ECT: explicit torment language, smoke ascending for ever, no rest day nor night). E150 is **Plain** in stating that (a) torment occurs, (b) smoke ascends for ever and ever, (c) no rest day nor night. However, E150 is **Ambiguous as to the duration mechanism** once the Rev 19:3 within-book demonstration is applied: if the identical formula in the same book describes completed destruction, then "smoke ascending for ever and ever" cannot be read as *necessarily* implying ongoing conscious perpetual experience — it may equally describe the permanent, irrevocable result of a completed judgment.

**Strong resolution criteria satisfied:** Plain items on the FOR-desolation side (Rev 19:3 same-formula/same-book demonstration; N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved)*; E147); the primary AGAINST item (E150) reduced to Ambiguous regarding the duration-mechanism question once the within-book demonstration is applied.

**Important qualification maintained from Moderate resolution:** The torment of the beast-worshippers (basanizo) is real. Both readings acknowledge genuine divine judgment. The Strong resolution applies specifically to the *duration mechanism* of the formula — the question of whether "smoke ascending for ever and ever" means perpetual ongoing conscious experience or permanent irrevocable result of completed destruction. The Strong resolution says: the formula means permanent irrevocable result, not perpetually ongoing conscious experience.
