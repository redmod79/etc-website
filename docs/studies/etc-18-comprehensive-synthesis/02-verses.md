## Theme 1: Human Nature and Mortality

*From etc5-01 (What Is Man), etc5-02 (Who Has Immortality), etc5-16 (Origins of ECT)*

### The Nature of Nephesh/Psyche (Soul)

**Gen 2:7** — "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul [nephesh chayyah]."
*Source: E001. Man BECAME a nephesh — he did not receive one. Identical formula applies to animals (Gen 1:24).*

**Ezk 18:4** — "Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die."
*Source: E029. Nephesh (soul) can die — contradicts notion of an inherently immortal soul.*

**Mat 10:28** — "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
*Source: E026. The soul (psyche) can be destroyed by God — not inherently exempt from destruction.*

**Gen 1:24** — "And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature [nephesh chayyah] after his kind." *(Identical formula for animals — E001 note)*

### God Alone Has Immortality

**1 Tim 6:16** — "Who only [monos] hath immortality [athanasian], dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting."
*Source: E021, E063. God ALONE has athanasia (deathlessness). Monos = uniquely, solely. Not shared with humans.*

**1 Cor 15:53-54** — "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
*Source: E064. Immortality is FUTURE — must be PUT ON at resurrection. Not currently possessed.*

**Rom 2:7** — "To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality [aphtharsia], eternal life."
*Source: E073. Immortality is SOUGHT — not already possessed.*

**Luke 20:35-36** — "But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."
*Source: E065. The deathless state comes through the resurrection — not through death.*

**1 Jn 5:11-12** — "And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."
*Source: E068. Life is in the Son — those without the Son do not have life.*

### Death = Sleep; Dead Lack Consciousness

**Ecc 9:5** — "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten."
*Source: E005. Direct statement: dead know not any thing.*

**Psa 146:4** — "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish."
*Source: E008. Thoughts perish at death — that very day.*

**Job 14:12** — "So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."
*Source: E011. Dead shall not awake UNTIL — a future resurrection event.*

**Ecc 9:10** — "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."
*Source: E017. No work, device, knowledge, or wisdom in sheol.*

**Psa 6:5** — "For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?"
*Source: E003. Dead do not praise or give thanks to God.*

**Isa 38:18** — "For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth."
*Source: E015. Sheol cannot praise God — King Hezekiah's explicit statement.*

**Dan 12:2** — "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."
*Source: E023. Death described as sleep; awakening is the resurrection. Olam for both outcomes.*

**1 Th 4:13-16** — "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep... For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout... and the dead in Christ shall rise first."
*Source: E099. Paul calls the dead "asleep"; remedy is resurrection, not release.*

---

## Theme 2: Death and Unconsciousness

*From etc5-03 (Biblical Death), etc5-04 (State of the Dead)*

### Three Death Registers

**Gen 3:19** — "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
*Source: E089. Physical death: return to dust.*

**Eph 2:1** — "And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins." *(Spiritual death = alienation from God)*

**Rev 20:14** — "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
*Source: E110. Equative identification: second death IS the lake of fire.*

**Rev 21:8** — "But the fearful, and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
*Source: E113. Second equative identification; eight human wicked categories.*

### Destruction as the Wicked's Fate

**Jhn 3:16** — "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish [apollumi], but have everlasting life."
*Source: E091, E114. Apollumi (perish/be destroyed) = antithesis of everlasting life; destruction vocabulary.*

**Rom 6:23** — "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
*Source: E090. Death vs. eternal life — not torment vs. eternal life.*

**1 Cor 15:18** — "Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished [apollumi]."
*Source: E095. Without resurrection, the dead have apollumi'd — Paul's own statement.*

**1 Cor 15:26** — "The last enemy that shall be destroyed [katargeō] is death."
*Source: E083. Death is to be abolished — the last eschatological act.*

**2 Th 1:9** — "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction [olethron aiōnion] from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power."
*Source: E116. The punishment IS destruction (olethros); aionion describes its permanent character.*

### The Intermediate State

**Acts 2:29** — "Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day."
*Source: E130. David dead and buried — in hades — as of Pentecost (same author as Luke 16).*

**Acts 2:31** — "He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell [hades], neither his flesh did see corruption."
*Source: E131. Christ's soul in hades until resurrection — governs Luke 23:43 via SIS #4a.*

**Rev 20:5** — "But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection."
*Source: E124, E241. The rest of the dead "lived not" — framework for the intermediate state.*

**Rev 14:13** — "And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours."
*Source: E129, E242. The Spirit's characterization of the blessed dead: they REST.*

**Rev 20:13** — "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works."
*Source: E134. Hades delivers up the dead at judgment — confirming N026 (hades = temporary).*

---

## Theme 3: Sheol/Hades/Gehenna/Tartarus

*From etc5-05 (Four Hell Words)*

### Sheol and Hades — Common Destination of All Dead

**Psa 16:10** — "For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [sheol]; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." *(Messianic; same soul in sheol applies to David, who is still there as of Acts 2:29)*

**Ecc 9:10** — "For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave [sheol]."
*Source: E017. Sheol = no activity.*

**Num 16:33** — "They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit [sheol]." *(Both wicked and righteous go to sheol)*

### Gehenna — Destruction Vocabulary, No Torment Vocabulary

**Mat 10:28** — "Fear him which is able to destroy [apollumi] both soul and body in hell [gehenna]."
*Source: E026. Gehenna uses apollumi (destroy), not basanizō (torment).*

**Mrk 9:43-48** — "It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell [gehenna], into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
*Source: E282. Three-fold present-tense refrain; source text = Isa 66:24 (corpses/pigrê, E141).*

**Mat 23:33** — "Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell [gehenna]?"
*(Forensic/judicial vocabulary — krinō — in the gehenna context, not basanizō)*

### The Sodom Paradigm — "Eternal Fire" = Ashes

**Jude 1:7** — "Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire [puros aiōniou]."
*Source: E147. Sodom = eternal fire — Scripture's designated example.*

**2 Pet 2:6** — "And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes [tephroō] condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly."
*Source: E161. Same event: eternal fire → ashes. Tephroō = reduced to ash. N029 established.*

**Gen 19:28** — "And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah...and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
*Source: E254. Abraham sees the smoke the morning AFTER the destruction — residue of completed event.*

### Tartaroo — Angels Only, Pre-Judgment

**2 Pet 2:4** — "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell [tartaroo], and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment."
*Source: E145, E287. Only NT use; applied only to fallen angels; pre-judgment custody; chains of darkness, not fire.*

---

## Theme 4: Destruction Vocabulary

*From etc5-06 (Destruction Vocabulary)*

### The Non-Existence Cluster

**Psa 37:20** — "But the wicked shall perish [abad], and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away."
*Source: E151. Wicked = consumed into smoke — imagery of cessation.*

**Mal 4:1** — "For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch."
*Source: E152. Stubble burned up; neither root nor branch — complete destruction imagery.*

**Mal 4:3** — "And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes [epher] under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts."
*Source: E153. Ashes — not living persons in torment.*

**Obad 1:16** — "For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been."
*Source: E154. Non-existence expression: "as though they had not been."*

**Psa 92:7,9** — "When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever [yishammedu ad-olam]... For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish [abad]; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered."
*Source: E162. Two destruction terms (shamad + abad) with ad-olam — permanent destruction vocabulary.*

**Isa 66:24** — "And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases [pigrê — H6297] of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring [dir'on] unto all flesh."
*Source: E141, E193, E271, E283. The objects of worm and fire are explicitly corpses (dead bodies). Dir'on is the attitude of observers TOWARD the corpses — not the experience of the condemned.*

### LXX Destruction Bridge

*(H6 abad → G622 apollumi: 141 LXX occurrences, PMI 6.14 — tool-confirmed dominant association; E174)*

**2 Pet 2:12** — "But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish [apollumi] in their own corruption."
*Source: E169. Apollumi for false teachers' fate.*

**Phil 3:19** — "Whose end is destruction [apoleia]."
*Source: E165. Paul's summary word for enemies of the cross: apoleia (destruction).*

**Rom 9:22** — "What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction [apoleia]?"
*Source: E310. Paul's word for those under God's wrath: apoleia — destruction vocabulary.*

### Destruction Vocabulary Distribution

*(~2,060+ total destruction vocabulary occurrences across 15+ word families — from etc5-06)*
*(Torment vocabulary: ~18 NT occurrences; ALL in Revelation — from N033)*

## Theme 5: "Forever" Language — OT and NT

*From etc5-07 (Olam/Forever in OT), etc5-08 (Aionios in NT)*

### Olam — Contextually Determined

**Hab 3:6** — "He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting [giv'ot olam] mountains were scattered, the perpetual [harre-ad] hills did bow: his ways are everlasting [halichot olam]."
*Source: E191. SAME VERSE: olam hills are scattered (finite); olam God's ways endure (infinite). N034 established: duration = nature of subject.*

**Exo 21:6** — "Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever [le-olam]."
*Source: E187. Olam bounded by mortality — the slave serves "forever" until death.*

**Jon 2:6** — "I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever [le-olam]: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God."
*Source: E189. Olam for Jonah's 72-hour fish experience.*

**Isa 32:14-15** — "...the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever [le-olam], a joy of wild asses... Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high."
*Source: E190. Olam desolation explicitly bounded by a future "until" clause.*

**Jer 51:39** — "In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep [shnat-olam], and not wake."
*Source: E132. Perpetual sleep = not waking = olam for complete cessation.*

**Jer 51:57** — "I will make drunk her princes... and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake [lo yaqitzu], saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts."
*Source: E194. Lo yaqitzu = shall not wake; same qits root as Dan 12:2 resurrection-waking.*

**Dan 12:2** — "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life [le-chayyei olam], and some to shame and everlasting contempt [le-dir'on olam]."
*Source: E023. Same olam construction for both outcomes; IB011 governs. Dir'on = attitude of observers toward corpses (E283).*

### The LXX Bridge

*(H5769 → G165 aion: 287x PMI 5.55; H5769 → G166 aionios: 100x PMI 5.67 — E195, N035)*

### Aionios — Subject-Dependent Adjective

**Rom 16:25** — "Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began [chronois aioniois seseigemenou]."
*Source: E204. Aionios = past elapsed ages (KJV: "since the world began"); N036 established.*

**2 Tim 1:9** — "Who hath saved us... not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began [pro chronon aionion]."
*Source: E205. Aionios again for past ages — before the ages began.*

**Tit 1:2** — "In hope of eternal life [zoes aionion], which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began [pro chronon aionion]."
*Source: E203. SAME VERSE: aionios for forward-looking eternal life AND backward-looking past ages.*

**Phm 1:15** — "For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever [aionion]."
*Source: E206. Aionios for Onesimus — a mortal human — bounded by their natural lifespans.*

**Heb 9:12** — "Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once [ephapax] into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [aionion lutrosin]."
*Source: E207. Aionios = permanent result of a COMPLETED act (ephapax = once for all); not an ongoing process.*

**Jude 1:6-7** — "And the angels which kept not their first estate... he hath reserved in everlasting [aidios] chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha... suffering the vengeance of eternal fire [aionios]."
*Source: E202. Same letter: aidios for ongoing angel confinement; aionios for Sodom's completed fire (= ashes per 2 Pet 2:6).*

### Aidios — Inherent Endlessness (G126; only 2 NT uses)

**Rom 1:20** — "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal [aidios] power and Godhead."
*Source: E201. Paul used aidios (inherent endlessness) for God's power, but aionios for punishment language.*

### Mat 25:46 — The Central Symmetry Passage

**Mat 25:46** — "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment [kolasin aionion]: but the righteous into life eternal [zoen aionion]."
*Source: E119, E208, E209. Both aionion instances A-ASF (grammatically identical). Punishment word = kolasis (penal infliction from kolazo = prune/curtail), NOT basanismos (torment). IB012 governs: duration = nature of referent.*

**Mat 25:41** — "Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire [pyr aiōnion], prepared for the devil and his angels [τῷ διαβόλῳ — dative of purpose]."
*Source: E118, E214. Fire prepared FOR (dative) the devil and his angels — supernatural named recipients. IB016 governs: human extension requires inference.*

---

## Theme 6: Claimed ECT Proof Texts

*From etc5-09 (Rich Man and Lazarus), etc5-10 (Souls Under Altar), etc5-11 (Smoke Ascending Forever), etc5-12 (Tormented Forever)*

### Luke 16:19-31 — The Rich Man and Lazarus (IB006: Moderate toward parabolic)

**Luke 16:19-23** — "There was a certain rich man [ánthrōpos dé tis ēn plousios]... And in hell [hades] he lift up his eyes, being in torments [basanos], and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
*Source: E123 (ECT E-item). The passage explicitly describes torment in hades. Both sides must acknowledge.*

**Luke 16:29, 31** — "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them... If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
*Source: E223. The passage's own stated theological purpose: sufficiency of existing revelation.*

**Luke 12:16** — "And he spake a parable [parabolēn] unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully."
*Source: E225. Same opening formula — explicitly labeled parabolē by Luke.*

**Acts 2:31** — "His soul was not left in hell [hades], neither his flesh did see corruption."
*Source: E131. Same Lukan author: hades = pre-resurrection holding state. Governs interpretation of Luk 16:23 (SIS #4a).*

*N038: Even on literal reading, the passage describes hades (temporary per N026), not the final state — cannot prove ECT.*

### Revelation 6:9-11 — Souls Under the Altar (IB013: STRONG toward personification)

**Rev 6:9-11** — "I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God... And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord... And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season."
*Source: E051 (reclassified from ECT to Neutral). Visionary description — both positions acknowledge the textual facts.*

**Gen 4:10** — "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground."
*Source: E234. Abel dead; his blood cries — blood-crying-for-justice convention; top NT parallel for Rev 6:10 (score 0.330, E236).*

**Rev 16:7** — "And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments."
*Source: E233. The altar itself speaks — inanimate object attributed speech within same book. N039: speech does not require consciousness in Revelation's genre.*

**Rev 20:4-5** — "And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus... and they lived [ezēsan] and reigned with Christ... This is the first resurrection."
*Source: E240, E241, N041. Same group (N040); their living = first resurrection event.*

### Revelation 14:9-11 — Smoke Ascending Forever (IB009: STRONG toward desolation)

**Rev 14:10-11** — "He shall be tormented [basanizō] with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment [basanismou] ascendeth up for ever and ever [eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn]: and they have no rest day nor night [anapausin ouk ekhousin hēmeras kai nyktos], who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name."
*Source: E150 (ECT E-item). Genuine ECT-direction explicit statement.*

**Rev 19:3** — "And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever [eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn]."
*Source: E250. Identical formula for Babylon — described as "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21). Same author, same book. IB009 upgraded to STRONG.*

**Rev 4:8** — "And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night [anapausin ouk ekhousin hēmeras kai nyktos], saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty."
*Source: E253. Identical "no rest day and night" phrase — describes four living creatures' ceaseless worship. IB014: Moderate toward judgment-process reading.*

**Isa 34:10** — "It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever."
*Source: E182. Tool-confirmed #1 OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (score 0.401). Aftermath (Isa 34:11-17): animals in desolated wasteland — not active burning.*

### Revelation 20:10 — Tormented Forever (IB015: Moderate toward permanent/irrevocable)

**Rev 20:10** — "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented [basanisthēsontai — Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural] day and night for ever and ever [eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn]."
*Source: E149 (ECT E-item). Subjects: three named supernatural/apocalyptic entities. IB015 governs.*

**Rev 20:9** — "And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured [katephagen] them."
*Source: E180. Human armies devoured (consumption vocabulary) — different vocabulary from Rev 20:10's torment formula.*

**Rev 20:15** — "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."
*Source: E111. Human wicked cast in — no torment formula repeated. Same author, adjacent verses.*

**Rev 19:20** — "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet... These both were cast alive [zōntes — Present Active Participle] into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."
*Source: E259. Beast and false prophet cast ALIVE — bypassing the death-resurrection-judgment sequence of mortal humans.*

---

## Theme 7: Lake of Fire and Second Death

*From etc5-13 (Lake of Fire and Second Death)*

### The Equative Identifications

**Rev 20:14** — "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
*Source: E110. Equative copula (estin = is): lake of fire = second death.*

**Rev 21:8** — "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
*Source: E113. Second equative identification — for eight human wicked categories.*

### Death as the Last Enemy

**1 Cor 15:26** — "The last enemy that shall be destroyed [katargeō] is death."
*Source: E083, E262. Death = last enemy to be abolished. Rev 20:14 narrates the execution; Rev 21:4 is the result.*

**1 Cor 15:54** — "So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
*Source: E075. Death abolished at resurrection.*

**Rev 21:4** — "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."
*Source: E112, E264. No more death — result of Death's abolition in Rev 20:14. Same word (thanatos) as in Rev 21:8.*

### Overcomer Exemption

**Rev 20:6** — "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power [exousia = authority/jurisdiction]; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years."
*Source: E109. Second death has no authority over first-resurrection participants.*

**Rev 2:11** — "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt [adikēthē — Aorist Passive Subjunctive] of the second death."
*Source: E108. Overcomer promise: exemption from the second death.*

### Rev 20 Vocabulary Distribution

| Verse | Subject | Language | Vocabulary |
|-------|---------|----------|------------|
| Rev 20:9 | Human armies | "devoured [katephagen]" | Consumption |
| Rev 20:10 | Devil, beast, false prophet | "tormented day and night for ever and ever" | Torment formula |
| Rev 20:14 | Death and Hades | "cast in" + "THIS IS the second death" | Death identity |
| Rev 20:15 | Human wicked ("whosoever not found written") | "was cast into the lake of fire" | Cast-in only |

---

## Theme 8: Major Judgment Passages

*From etc5-14 (Judgment Passages)*

### Forensic/Judicial Vocabulary — Not Torment Vocabulary

**Rev 20:12** — "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged [ekrithēsan — krinō, G2919] out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works."
*Source: E268, N043. Judgment verb = ekrithēsan (judicial verdict), not basanizō.*

**Jhn 5:29** — "And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation [anastasim kriseōs — G2920]."
*Source: E270, N045. Negative resurrection named after krisis (verdict/judgment), not basanismos (torment). Krisis: 34 NT uses, all judicial vocabulary.*

**Heb 6:2** — "Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment [krima aiōnion — G2917 + G166]."
*Source: E273. "Eternal judgment" listed as foundational doctrine — krima (verdict/judicial decision), not basanismos.*

**2Co 5:10** — "For we must all appear before the judgment seat [bēma — G968] of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."
*Source: E278. Bēma = tribunal/raised platform for judicial decisions — forensic vocabulary.*

**Mat 12:36-37** — "But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment: For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned [katakrithēsē — judicial verdict]."
*Source: E279. Outcome = judicial condemnation (katakrino), not torment specification.*

### Destruction Vocabulary — Not Torment Vocabulary

**Rom 2:12** — "For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish [apollōntai — G622, Fut Mid Ind] without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law."
*Source: E275, N044. Paul's summary word for the fate of the wicked: apollumi (perish completely).*

**Heb 10:27** — "But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour [esthiein — G2068, V-PAN: to eat/devour] the adversaries."
*Source: E272, N046. Fire's action = esthiō (consumption/devouring) — not basanizō (torment).*

**Rev 11:18** — "...the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and... that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints... and shouldest destroy [diaphtheirai — G1311] them which destroy the earth."
*Source: E276. Verb for the wicked's fate = diaphtheirō (destroy utterly) — not basanizō.*

**Acts 24:15** — "And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."
*Source: E269. Paul explicitly affirms the two-resurrection framework.*

### Wailing and Gnashing Passages — No Torment Vocabulary

**Mat 8:12** — "But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth [klauthmos, brygmos]."
**Mat 13:42** — "And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."
*Source: E260. Seven wailing/gnashing passages — no G928/G929 (torment vocabulary); no for-ever formula; diverse/incompatible settings (outer darkness vs. furnace of fire = parabolic imagery).*

## Theme 9: ECT Strongest Arguments

*From etc5-15 (ECT Strongest Case)*

### ECT E-Tier Items (All 7)

**E038 — 2 Cor 5:8** — "We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."
*ECT E-item: intermediate state; righteous. SIS: governed by 1 Cor 15:18 (absent without resurrection = apollumi).*

**E039 — Phil 1:23** — "For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better."
*ECT E-item: intermediate state; righteous. SIS: IB001 Moderate AGAINST; 1 Cor 15:18 governs.*

**E050 — Luke 23:43** — "And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise."
*ECT E-item: intermediate state; righteous. SIS: Acts 2:31 (same author) places Christ in hades until resurrection.*

**E052 — Heb 12:23** — "To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect."
*ECT E-item: intermediate state; righteous. IB001 governs.*

**E123 — Luke 16:23-25** — "And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments [basanois], and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
*ECT E-item: rich man in torments in hades. IB006 Moderate toward parabolic governs.*

**E149 — Rev 20:10** — "The devil... shall be tormented [basanisthēsontai] day and night for ever and ever."
*ECT E-item: three named supernatural entities. IB015 Moderate governs; subjects are supernatural.*

**E150 — Rev 14:10-11** — "He shall be tormented [basanizō]... the smoke of their torment [basanismos] ascendeth up for ever and ever."
*ECT E-item: beast-worshippers (specific tribulation-era class). IB009 STRONG governs smoke formula.*

### The Zero-N-Tier Finding

*No ECT argument reaches the N tier for the universal claim that ALL human wicked experience ongoing conscious torment FOREVER.*

*Every ECT argument requires at least one inference step: interpreting duration mechanism, inferring same-location = same-experience, extending from named specific subjects to all human wicked, or reading the for-ever formula as necessarily requiring perpetual conscious experience.*

## Theme 10: Historical Origins

*From etc5-16 (Origins of ECT)*

### Tartaroo — Greek Mythological Term, Restricted NT Use

**2 Pet 2:4** — "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell [tartaroo], and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment."
*Source: E145, E287. Only NT use; etymologically from Greek Tartaros (mythological abyss for Titans). Peter's use: restricted to fallen angels; pre-judgment only; chains of darkness, not fire.*

### Kolasis — Pruning/Curtailment Root

**Mat 25:46** — "...into everlasting punishment [kolasin aionion]..."
*Source: E209, E288. Kolasis from kolazo (to prune/curtail/restrain). Appears only 2x in NT. Root = curtailment, not ongoing torture.*

**1 Jn 4:18** — "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment [kolasin]. He that feareth is not made perfect in love."
*Only other NT occurrence of kolasis — used for present experiential fear, not eschatological torment.*

### Nave's Topical Organization

*(E284: GEHENNA and SHEOL redirect to HELL — four distinct terms collapsed into one English category)*
*(E285: Nave's TORMENTS entry cites only two passage clusters — Luke 16:23-28 and Rev 14:10,11)*
*(E286: Nave's FIRE eschatological sub-entry labeled "Of the DESTRUCTION of the wicked" — not torment)*

## Theme 11: God's Character and Justice

*From etc5-17 (God's Character and Justice)*

### God's Justice — All His Ways are Right

**Gen 18:25** — "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right [mishpat]?"
*Source: E289. Foundational assertion that God's judgment must conform to the standard of what is right.*

**Deut 32:4** — "He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment [mishpat]: a God of truth and without iniquity, just [tsaddiq] and right [yashar] is he."

*Source: E293. Judgment doxologies in Revelation; proportionality rationale in v.6: "they are worthy."*

### God's Love and Non-Desire for Wicked's Death/Perishing

**Exo 34:6-7** — "The LORD, The LORD God, merciful [rachum] and gracious [channun], longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth... Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty."

**Ezk 33:11** — "As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
*Source: E297. God swears by his own life (most solemn OT oath formula): no pleasure in the wicked's death.*

**Ezk 18:23** — "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?"
*Source: E106.*

**Ezk 18:32** — "For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye."
*Source: E107.*

**2 Pet 3:9** — "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing [ou boulomai] that any should perish [apollumi], but that all should come to repentance."
*Source: E302. God's deliberate will (boulomai): he does NOT will the apollumi (destruction) of any.*

**Mat 18:14** — "Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish [apollumi]."
*Source: E303. Father's will explicitly stated: not that any perish (apollumi).*

**1 Jn 4:8, 16** — "He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him."
*Source: E304. "God is love" — stated twice; predicate nominative.*

### God's Wrath is Non-Perpetual

**Isa 57:15-16** — "For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place... For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made."
*Source: E299. The Holy One who inhabits eternity explicitly states he will NOT contend perpetually.*

**Mic 7:18** — "Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy."
*Source: E301. God does NOT retain anger forever — because he delights in mercy.*

**Hos 11:8-9** — "How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?... I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee."
*Source: E298. God restrains fierce anger — invokes his divine nature as the reason.*

**Lam 3:33** — "For he doth not afflict willingly [lo milib-bo — not from his heart/inner being], nor grieve the children of men."
*Source: E300. God's affliction not from his inner will or desire.*

### God's Holiness — Demands Sin Be Addressed

**Isa 6:3, 5** — "Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory... Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips."
*Source: E306. Supreme OT triple-holiness declaration; human response of awe at uncleanness.*

**Hab 1:12-13** — "Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?... Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity."
*Source: E307. God's holiness = absolute ethical purity that demands sin be addressed.*

### Graduated Punishment

**Luk 12:47-48** — "And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required."
*Source: E311. Jesus explicitly teaches graduated punishment — severity proportional to degree of knowledge and responsibility. IA027 (reclassified from I-A to I-C): extended to eschatological final punishment.*
