# Bible Study: Comprehensive Synthesis -- The Final Fate of the Wicked (etc Series)

## Question
Final synthesis of all 17 studies (etc-01 through etc-17). Deduplicated positional tally from etc-master-evidence.md. Raw and deduplicated counts. "What CAN/CANNOT Be Said" across all studies.

## Study Type
This is a SYNTHESIS study. It does not investigate new passages or perform new verse retrieval. It analyzes, counts, and synthesizes the evidence gathered across 17 prior studies.

## Source Data
- **etc-master-evidence.md** -- Central file containing all 597 deduplicated evidence items (449 E, 65 N, 83 I)
- **17 CONCLUSION.md files** -- Each study's findings, tally, CAN/CANNOT statements
- **etc-series-methodology.md** -- The E/N/I classification system and Tree 3 validation protocol

## Scope
1. Complete deduplicated positional tally from etc-master-evidence.md
2. Raw (non-deduplicated) counts showing cross-study citation frequency
3. Cross-study pattern analysis
4. Tier strength analysis (E vs N vs I per position)
5. "What CAN Be Said" (E-tier supported conclusions)
6. "What CANNOT Be Said" (claims not supported by evidence)
7. Key contested items (I-B items where both positions claim the same verse)
8. Final assessment based on biblical evidence
