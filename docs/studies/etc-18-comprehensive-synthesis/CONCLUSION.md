## The Question

Taking all the biblical evidence together from the 17 prior studies in this series, what does Scripture teach about the final fate of the wicked? What is explicitly stated? What is necessarily implied? What requires inference? Does the totality of biblical evidence establish eternal conscious torment (ECT) or destruction/annihilation (Conditionalism) — or does it leave the question unresolved?

---

## Summary Answer

The 410 deduplicated evidence items across 17 studies distribute as follows: 128 Conditionalist E-items, 0 ECT E-items, 184 Neutral E-items, 27 Conditionalist N-items, zero ECT N-items, 25 Conditionalist I-A items, zero ECT I-A items, 3 Conditionalist I-C items, and 3 ECT I-D items. The 7 E-items previously classified as ECT were reclassified to Neutral after a systematic audit applying the methodology's own rules: grammar (what the text's grammar actually states vs. what is assumed), context (what surrounding passages and same-author writings say), and harmony (one explicit statement cannot contradict another; unclear verses must be interpreted by clear). At the highest evidence tiers (E-tier classification and N-tier inference), the conditionalist vocabulary — death, destruction, perishing — pervades both testaments across all literary genres, while torment vocabulary appears in 18 eschatological occurrences confined to Revelation's apocalyptic imagery. No E-tier item, when read with attention to grammar, context, and harmony with other explicit statements, explicitly supports the ECT position. The ECT position generates zero N-tier items for the universal claim that all human wicked experience ongoing conscious torment forever; every ECT argument assessed in Study 15 remained at the I-B (competing evidence) tier. The conditionalist position generates 27 N-tier items directly from explicit statements without adding external concepts, and 25 I-A items systematizing E/N evidence without overriding any explicit statement. All 18 I-B (competing evidence) items were resolved using the Scripture-Interprets-Scripture protocol: two resolved STRONG in the conditionalist direction, fifteen resolved Moderate either toward conditionalist or against ECT claims, and one — the ontological question of substance dualism vs. holistic dichotomy — remains unresolved. The three ECT I-D items support ECT by overriding explicit statements (E029/N005: God alone has immortality; E024/N007: the soul can die; N008: God can destroy the soul), requiring redefinition of the plain vocabulary the text uses. The weight and distribution of the evidence base as classified across 17 systematic studies is more consistent with conditionalism than with ECT.

## The 7 Former ECT E-Tier Items — Reclassified to Neutral

These 7 items were previously classified as ECT E-tier. A systematic audit applying the methodology's own rules — grammar (what the text's grammar actually states), context (surrounding passage and same-author writings), and harmony (one explicit statement cannot contradict another; unclear verses must be interpreted by clear) — determined that the ECT classification in each case depended on assumptions not present in the text. All 7 have been reclassified to Neutral.

**E038 — 2 Corinthians 5:8 → NEUTRAL**
The text states: Paul is "willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord." Two infinitives joined by kai (and); no temporal marker specifies simultaneity. The previous description used "as" (implying identity/simultaneity), but the grammar says "and."
- **Context:** In the same passage (2 Cor 5:1-4, E037), Paul says he does NOT want to be "unclothed" (disembodied) but "clothed upon" — he wants the resurrection body, not a bodiless state.
- **Harmony:** Contradicts E013 (Psa 146:4: thoughts perish at death), E017 (Ecc 9:5: dead know nothing), E019 (Ecc 9:10: no knowledge in the grave), E029/N005 (God alone has immortality), N006 (immortality acquired at resurrection, not at death).
- **Reclassification basis:** The ECT reading (conscious presence with Christ immediately at death) requires adding simultaneity the grammar does not state and contradicts multiple explicit statements from multiple independent authors.

**E039 — Philippians 1:23 → NEUTRAL**
The text states: Paul has "a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better." Two infinitives joined by kai; no temporal marker.
- **Context:** Paul places being "ever with the Lord" at the resurrection/second coming in 1 Th 4:16-17 (E099). From the dead person's subjective perspective, the next conscious moment after death IS the resurrection — no experienced gap.
- **Harmony:** Same contradicting E-items as E038. Paul consistently locates "with the Lord" at the parousia, not at death.
- **Reclassification basis:** Both sides agree Paul said this. The ECT reading (departure = immediate consciousness with Christ) is an inference from the juxtaposition, not a grammatical requirement, and contradicts Paul's own timeline in 1 Thessalonians.

**E050 — Luke 23:43 → NEUTRAL**
The text states: Jesus says "amēn soi legō sēmeron met emou esē en tō paradeisō." The KJV renders: "Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise." Greek manuscripts have no punctuation; comma placement is editorial.
- **Harmony — direct contradiction:** Jesus was NOT in paradise that day.
  - E131 (Acts 2:31): Peter explicitly states Christ's soul was in hades between death and resurrection — not paradise. This is Luke's own framework (Luke-Acts, same author).
  - John 20:17 (post-resurrection, Sunday): Jesus tells Mary "I am not yet ascended to my Father" — still not in paradise even after the resurrection.
- **Resolution:** "Today" modifies "I say" — "I say to you today [on this day when everything looks like defeat], you will be with me in paradise [at the resurrection]." This reading harmonizes with E131 and John 20:17 rather than contradicting them.
- **Reclassification basis:** The ECT reading depends on a punctuation choice that creates a direct contradiction with E131 (same author) and John 20:17. An explicit statement cannot contradict other explicit statements.

**E052 — Hebrews 12:23 → NEUTRAL**
The text states: "The spirits of just men made perfect" are listed among the assembly of the heavenly Jerusalem.
- **Harmony — same author, same book:** E228 (Heb 11:13, 39-40): "These all died in faith, not having received the promises... that they without us should not be made perfect." The author of Hebrews himself, two chapters earlier, explicitly states the OT righteous are NOT YET perfected.
- **Reclassification basis:** Reading Heb 12:23 as "currently conscious perfected spirits" directly contradicts Heb 11:40 by the same author. The listing in 12:22-24 is eschatological/anticipatory — describing the new-covenant reality the readers have "come unto" — not a spatiotemporal report of currently conscious spirits.

**E123 — Luke 16:23-25 → NEUTRAL**
The text narrates: The rich man "being in torments" in hades cries out; Abraham confirms "thou art tormented."
- **Context:** Follows a series of parables; uses the same "certain rich man" formula as Luk 12:16 (explicitly labeled a parable). IB006 (Moderate toward parabolic genre). Even on a literal reading, N038 establishes the setting is hades — the temporary pre-resurrection state (N026), not the lake of fire or the final post-judgment state.
- **Harmony:** Contradicts E013 (thoughts perish at death), E014 (dead praise not the Lord), E015 (no remembrance in death), E016 (land of forgetfulness), E017 (dead know nothing), E018 (love/hatred/envy perished), E019 (no knowledge in the grave), E020 (man lieth down and riseth not), E022 (grave cannot praise). Multiple independent witnesses (Job, Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Isaiah) state the dead lack consciousness — the rich man in this narrative does everything they say the dead cannot do.
- **Reclassification basis:** Multiple clear, didactic, straightforward explicit statements from multiple independent authors establish that the dead lack consciousness. One narrative in parabolic context shows a dead man conscious. The unclear (parabolic narrative) must be interpreted by the clear (didactic statements).

**E149 — Revelation 20:10 → NEUTRAL**
The text states: "The devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
- **Grammar:** The subjects are three named entities. The beast and false prophet are symbolic kingdom/power-system entities — E179 (Rev 17:8, 11) uses apoleia (destruction) for the beast's destiny, and Rev 17:11 identifies the beast as one of seven heads/kingdoms.
- **Context:** E231 (Rev 1:1): the book's self-described communication mode is esēmainō (communicate through signs/symbols). Rev 19:3 applies the grammatically identical smoke-for-ever formula to Babylon, which is "found no more at all" (E257: Rev 18:21). Same author, same book, same formula, demonstrably completed destruction.
- **Harmony:** E029/N005 (God alone has immortality) — perpetual torment requires perpetual existence.
- **Reclassification basis:** Two of three subjects are explicitly symbolic entities whose destiny is elsewhere called "destruction." The "for ever" formula is demonstrated within the same book to describe permanent cessation. The book's genre is self-described as symbolic. Reading this as literal perpetual conscious torment of individual persons requires multiple assumptions the text does not state.

**E150 — Revelation 14:10-11 → NEUTRAL**
The text states: Beast-worshippers "shall be tormented with fire and brimstone... And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night."
- **Grammar:** E211 (tool-confirmed Greek parsing): the nominative grammatical subject of "ascendeth" (anabainei, present active indicative, 3rd singular) is ho kapnos (THE SMOKE, N-NSM). Basanismou (torment) is genitive — "the smoke OF torment." The "for ever and ever" (eis aionas aionon) modifies the ascending of the smoke, not the consciousness of the persons.
- **Context:** The OT source parallel (Isa 34:10, the #1 tool-confirmed parallel) uses identical language ("the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; it shall not be quenched night nor day") for Edom's destruction — which is demonstrably completed. N029 (Sodom paradigm): "eternal fire" = permanent result, not ongoing process. IB009 (STRONG): the same formula in Rev 19:3 describes permanent cessation.
- **Subject class:** Beast-worshippers (a specific tribulation-era class), not "all wicked people everywhere forever." IB008 (Moderate) prevents universal extension.
- **Reclassification basis:** The grammar itself (E211) shows the "forever" attaches to smoke ascending (aftermath imagery), not to persons being consciously tormented. The OT parallel and within-book parallel both describe completed destruction. Reading this as perpetual conscious torment requires overriding the grammar.

**Summary: After reclassification, zero E-tier items support the ECT position.** The ECT position's only evidence items are 3 I-D items (which support ECT by overriding explicit statements) and the I-B items (all of which resolved either toward conditionalism or against ECT).

## Key E-Conditionalist Items (Selected)

The following are among the most significant conditionalist explicit statements across the 17 studies.

**On human mortality and the soul:**
- E001 (Gen 2:7): Man became a living soul; the identical formula applies to animals (Gen 1:24)
- E021 (1 Tim 6:16): God alone [monos] has immortality [athanasia]
- E024 (Ezk 18:4): "The soul that sinneth, it shall die"
- E026 (Mat 10:28): "Fear him which is able to destroy [apollumi] both soul and body in hell [gehenna]"
- E029 (Rom 2:7): Immortality is something believers seek for — not currently possessed
- E031 (1 Cor 15:53): "This mortal must put on immortality" — future event, at resurrection

**On death as the outcome of sin:**
- E072 (Rom 6:23): "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life"
- E091 (Jhn 3:16): "Should not perish [apollumi] but have everlasting life" — antitheses
- E095 (1 Cor 15:18): "They also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished [apollumi]" — if no resurrection
- E110 (Rev 20:14): "Death and hell cast into lake of fire: THIS IS the second death"
- E113 (Rev 21:8): "Lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which IS the second death"
- E116 (2 Th 1:9): "Everlasting destruction [olethron aionion] from the presence of the Lord"

**On the destruction vocabulary:**
- E147 (Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6): Scripture's own "eternal fire" example — Sodom — produced ashes
- E151 (Psa 37:20): Enemies of the Lord "shall be consumed into smoke; they shall consume into smoke"
- E152 (Mal 4:1): "Shall leave them neither root nor branch"
- E153 (Mal 4:3): "They shall be ashes under the soles of your feet"
- E154 (Obad 1:16): "They shall be as though they had not been"

**On God's stated will:**
- E297 (Ezk 33:11): By solemn oath: "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked"
- E302 (2 Pet 3:9): "Not willing that any should perish [apollumi]"
- E303 (Mat 18:14): "It is not the will of your Father that one of these little ones should perish [apollumi]"

**On judgment vocabulary:**
- E270 (Jhn 5:29): The negative resurrection is anastasim kriseōs (judgment/verdict), not anastasim basanismou (torment)
- E272 (Heb 10:27): The fire that judges adversaries acts by esthiein (devouring/consuming) — not basanizō
- E275 (Rom 2:12): "They that have sinned without law shall also perish [apollōntai = apollumi]"

**ECT I-A: 0**

### I-B Evidence: The 18 Competing-Evidence Items

All items where genuine textual evidence exists on both sides. All 18 resolved using the 5-step SIS protocol.

| ID | Thesis | Resolution | Direction |
|----|--------|-----------|-----------|
| IB001 | Conscious intermediate state for righteous | Moderate | Against conscious state |
| IB002 | "Under the sun" qualifier limits Ecc pessimism | Moderate | Against ECT implication |
| IB003 | Trichotomy (three-part substance) | Moderate | Against trichotomy |
| IB004 | Substance dualism vs. holistic dichotomy | **UNRESOLVED** | Only unresolved item |
| IB005 | Life-force (ruach) reading vs. personal spirit | Moderate | Toward life-force |
| IB006 | Luke 16 genre (literal vs. parabolic) | Moderate | Toward parabolic |
| IB007 | Luke 20:38 resurrection-certainty reading | Moderate | Toward resurrection-certainty |
| IB008 | Universal torment extension (Rev 14:10-11 to all wicked) | Moderate | Against universal extension |
| IB009 | Smoke-for-ever formula (desolation vs. ongoing torment) | **STRONG** | Toward permanent desolation |
| IB010 | 2Th 1:9 apo prosopou (banishment vs. source/agent) | Moderate | Against banishment |
| IB011 | Dan 12:2 symmetry | Moderate | Toward referent-nature |
| IB012 | Mat 25:46 symmetry (kolasis vs. basanismos) | Moderate | Toward referent-nature |
| IB013 | Rev 6:9-11 (literal souls vs. personification) | **STRONG** | Toward personification |
| IB014 | "No rest day and night" (torment vs. judgment-process) | Moderate | Toward judgment-process |
| IB015 | Rev 20:10 for-ever formula on active torment verb | Moderate | Toward permanent/irrevocable |
| IB016 | Mat 25:41 fire for devil = same for humans? | Moderate | Against universal extension |
| IB017 | Jhn 5:29 krisis vocabulary (does krisis include torment?) | Moderate | Against torment-reading |
| IB018 | God's character (more consistent with which position?) | Moderate | Toward conditionalist |

**Strong resolution basis — IB009:** Rev 19:3 applies the grammatically identical formula (kapnos + anabainei + eis tous aionas ton aionon) to Babylon, which is described as "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21). Same author, same book, same formula, demonstrably completed destruction. This constitutes a #4a SIS connection. Strong criteria satisfied.

**Strong resolution basis — IB013:** Five #4a SIS connections within the same author/book: Rev 16:7 (altar speaks — inanimate object speech in same book); Rev 6:8 (Death/Hades as horsemen in same vision sequence); Gen 4:10 (dead Abel's blood cries — tool-verified top NT parallel for Rev 6:10, score 0.330); Rev 20:4-5 (martyrs' "living" = first resurrection, same author/book); Rev 14:13 (anapauō characterizes the blessed dead, same word as Rev 6:11). Strong criteria satisfied.

### I-C Evidence (3 items — all Conditionalist)

- **IC001:** Subjective-time framework for Phil 1:23 / 2 Cor 5:8 — external philosophical framework compatible with conditionalism
- **IC002:** Rev 14:11 / 14:13 literary parallelism (no rest vs. rest from labors) — does not override E/N
- **IC003:** Peter's restricted use of tartaroo demonstrates non-endorsement of broader Greek Tartaros cosmology

### I-D Evidence (3 items — all ECT-supporting, all override E/N)

- **ID001:** Humans possess an inherent immortal soul — overrides E029/N005 (God alone has immortality), E031/N006 (immortality at resurrection), E024/N007 (soul can die), E026/N008 (God can destroy the soul)
- **ID002:** Ezk 18:4 "soul that sins shall die" refers only to physical death of the body — overrides E024 by restricting the death-predicate despite nephesh being the explicit grammatical subject
- **ID003:** "God alone [monos] has immortality" describes preeminence, not exclusive possession — overrides N005 by requiring monos to mean "preeminently" against its plain meaning; the same monos in 1 Tim 6:15 ("only Potentate") functions exclusively in the adjacent verse

## Synthesis by Study Area

### Study Area 1: Foundational Anthropology (etc5-01 through etc5-04)

Studies 01-04 established the baseline anthropology governing all subsequent passage interpretation. Man became (hayah, result-form) a living soul in Gen 2:7 — the identical formula applies to animals (Gen 1:24). God alone has athanasia (1 Tim 6:16). The soul/nephesh can die (Ezk 18:4). God can destroy both soul and body (Mat 10:28). All 18 NT immortality-term occurrences either ascribe immortality to God alone or place it at resurrection. The dead lack consciousness, knowledge, praise, and communication — stated by multiple independent authors across both testaments (Job, Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Isaiah, Jesus, Paul). IB001 resolved Moderate against conscious intermediate state; IB004 (substance dualism) remains unresolved.

The foundational studies established 155 items (88 + 39 + 13 + 13 = 153 from studies 01-04). If humans lack inherent immortality by creation, then: (a) the wicked cannot self-sustain in torment through their own nature; (b) the outcome named "second death" genuinely means death, not an alternative mode of existence; (c) every passage describing the wicked's fate using death vocabulary is consistent with actual cessation; (d) the three ECT I-D items (ID001-ID003) are required to maintain the ECT position against these explicit statements.

### Study Area 2: The Vocabulary Divide (etc5-05 through etc5-06)

Study 06 established ~2,060+ occurrences across 15+ Hebrew and Greek destruction word families throughout both testaments. The LXX bridge: H6 (abad) → G622 (apollumi), PMI 6.14 — the dominant, non-accidental correspondence. G622 (apollumi): 92 NT occurrences throughout every canonical genre. N033 establishes: basanizō/basanismos and the destruction vocabulary are lexically non-overlapping — no NT text uses both for the same event applied to the same subject.

Against this: G928 (basanizō): 12 NT occurrences total, with eschatological uses confined to Revelation. G929 (basanismos): 6 NT occurrences, ALL in Revelation (E172).

The ratio in eschatological contexts: destruction vocabulary is genre-spanning (Pauline epistles, Synoptic Gospels, General Epistles, OT prophets), torment vocabulary is genre-confined (Revelation's apocalyptic imagery). Paul's eschatological noun for the fate of the wicked is consistently olethros (destruction), never basanismos (torment). IA024 establishes: torment vocabulary is absent from all 10 major judgment passages while destruction vocabulary is present in every judgment passage that uses specific outcome vocabulary.

### Study Area 3: The Duration-Word Resolution (etc5-07 through etc5-08)

N034 (Hab 3:6 demonstration): olam in the same verse applies to mountains that scatter (finite) and to God's ways that endure (infinite). Duration is determined by the subject's nature. N036 (aionios past-time uses): aionios refers to elapsed past ages in three NT passages (Rom 16:25; 2 Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2). N037 (morphology): aionios is a denominal adjective (aion + -ios), not an alpha-privative. Aidios (from aei = always) carries inherent endlessness.

The Jude 1:6-7 within-letter demonstration: aidios for angels' ongoing confinement; aionios for Sodom's completed fire (= ashes, 2 Pet 2:6) — same author, same letter, consecutive verses. Paul chose aidios for God's power (Rom 1:20) and aionios for punishment language in the same epistle.

Application: "Everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion) — kolasis is from kolazo (prune/curtail), not basanismos. IB012 governs the duration inference. "Everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion, 2 Th 1:9) — the result IS destruction. "Eternal fire" (pyr aiōnion) — N029 governs via the Sodom paradigm: eternal fire = permanent result, not perpetual burning process.

### Study Area 4: The Four ECT Proof-Texts (etc5-09 through etc5-12)

The four major claimed ECT proof-texts were examined in dedicated studies. Each resolved as I-B (competing evidence), not E or N for the ECT claim:

**Rich Man and Lazarus (IB006: Moderate toward parabolic):** The "certain rich man" formula (Luke 12:16 explicit parabolic label; Luke 16:1 same discourse-level context). Even on a literal reading, N038 establishes the setting is hades — the temporary pre-resurrection state (N026) — not the lake of fire or the final post-judgment state. The stated theological purpose (vv.29-31): sufficiency of Moses and the Prophets, not eschatological description. The naming of Lazarus is a genuine anomaly preventing Strong resolution.

**Souls Under the Altar (IB013: STRONG toward personification):** Five #4a SIS connections prevent the literal-conscious-spirits reading: altar speaks (Rev 16:7), Death/Hades as horsemen (Rev 6:8), Gen 4:10 blood-crying convention (tool-verified top NT parallel), martyrs' "living" = first resurrection (Rev 20:4-5), anapauō characterizes blessed dead (Rev 14:13). E051 reclassified from ECT to Neutral.

**Smoke Ascending Forever (IB009: STRONG toward permanent desolation):** Rev 19:3 applies the identical formula to Babylon ("found no more at all") within the same book by the same author. Isa 34:10 is the tool-confirmed #1 OT parallel (smoke/desolation vocabulary bridge). N029 (Sodom paradigm) independently confirms: eternal fire = permanent result.

**Tormented Forever (IB015: Moderate toward permanent/irrevocable):** The torment formula in Rev 20:10 applies to exactly three named supernatural/symbolic entities (devil, beast, false prophet). Rev 20:15 casts human wicked into the same lake without repeating the formula. IB009's within-book demonstration prevents Strong ECT resolution from the for-ever formula.

Pattern from all four: every major claimed ECT proof-text, examined in its literary and canonical context, either addresses a specific limited subject class, describes a pre-final-judgment state, or uses imagery whose within-book/within-canon parallels demonstrate that the language describes permanent outcome rather than perpetual conscious process.

### Study Area 5: The Three-Vocabulary Pattern of Rev 20:9-15 (etc5-11 through etc5-15)

Rev 20:9-15 applies three distinct vocabulary sets to three distinct subject groups in three consecutive passage units:

1. **Rev 20:9 — Human armies surrounding the holy city:** "fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured [katephagen] them." Consumption/devouring vocabulary. No torment formula.

2. **Rev 20:10 — Three named supernatural/symbolic entities (devil, beast, false prophet):** "tormented day and night for ever and ever." Explicit torment formula. IB015 governs the duration inference.

3. **Rev 20:14-15 — Human wicked ("whosoever was not found written in the book of life"):** "cast into the lake of fire" = "the second death." The torment formula is not applied. The lake of fire receives the name "second death" (thanatos — standard death word) when human wicked are the subject.

This three-vocabulary pattern was identified across five studies (etc5-11, 12, 13, 14, 15) without artificial imposition. The systematic vocabulary differentiation within the same passage, by the same author, for subjects standing in the same location is an observable literary fact (N043-N046 confirm the surrounding judgment vocabulary: krinō, krisis, esthiō).

### Study Area 6: The Zero-N-Tier Finding (etc5-15)

Study 15 examined the 8 strongest ECT arguments in a steel-man exercise. The finding: zero ECT arguments reached the N (Necessary Implication) tier for the universal claim that ALL human wicked experience ongoing conscious torment FOREVER.

Every ECT argument requires at least one inference step:
- Interpreting the duration mechanism of the for-ever formula (IB009 STRONG governs)
- Inferring same-location = same-experience from subjects with different vocabulary labels (IB008, IB016)
- Extending from three named supernatural entities to all human wicked (IB008, IB015)
- Reading conscious-torment content into judgment vocabulary that uses judicial/cessation terms (IB017)
- Reading a narrative passage's genre as literal eschatological description (IB006)

By contrast, the conditionalist position generates 27 N-items directly from E-tier statements (applying the three N-tier tests: universal agreement test, no interpretation required test, zero added concepts test) and 25 I-A items systematizing E/N evidence without overriding any explicit statement.

The contrast between zero ECT N-items and 27 conditionalist N-items is a structural feature of the classified evidence base.

### Study Area 7: God's Character Evidence (etc5-17)

Nine Plain or Contextually Clear character statements establish what the text says about God's relationship to the apollumi (destruction) of the wicked:
- "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked" — by solemn oath formula (Ezk 33:11)
- "Not willing that any should perish [apollumi]" (2 Pet 3:9)
- "It is not the will of your Father that one of these little ones should perish [apollumi]" (Mat 18:14)
- "He doth not afflict willingly" (Lam 3:33)
- "He retaineth not his anger for ever" (Mic 7:18)
- "I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth" (Isa 57:15-16)

The vocabulary throughout is apollumi/death (destruction vocabulary), not basanismos (torment vocabulary). IB018 (Moderate toward conditionalist) governs. IA028 systematizes: the pattern of God's non-desire for apollumi + non-perpetual wrath is more consistent with annihilation than ECT. The character evidence corroborates the vocabulary evidence at E/N tier; both use the same destruction vocabulary.

### Study Area 8: The I-B Resolution Pattern (All 17 Studies)

2 Strong: both in the conditionalist direction.
15 Moderate: all either toward conditionalist direction or against ECT claims.
1 Unresolved: IB004 (substance dualism vs. holistic dichotomy — an ontological question about human composition, not directly about the wicked's final fate).

The I-B items specifically pertaining to ECT-direction claims resolved as follows:
- IB006 (Luke 16 literal reading): Moderate toward parabolic
- IB008 (universal torment extension): Moderate against
- IB009 (smoke formula = ongoing torment): STRONG against perpetual-torment reading
- IB013 (Rev 6:9-11 = conscious spirits): STRONG against literal reading
- IB014 (no-rest phrase = ongoing torment): Moderate toward judgment-process
- IB015 (Rev 20:10 for-ever = ongoing conscious torment): Moderate toward permanent/irrevocable only
- IB016 (Mat 25:41 universal extension): Moderate against
- IB017 (krisis = torment content): Moderate against torment-reading

No I-B item resolved toward ECT.

### Study Area 9: The I-D Accumulation (etc5-01, etc5-02)

The three ECT I-D items all override E/N statements:
- ID001 overrides four E/N statements (E029/N005, E031/N006, E024/N007, E026/N008)
- ID002 overrides E024 by restricting the subject despite nephesh being the explicit grammatical subject
- ID003 overrides N005 by requiring monos (alone/only) to mean "preeminently" — the same word in the adjacent verse (1 Tim 6:15: "only Potentate") functions exclusively

I-D items represent claims that require overriding the plain meaning of explicit statements. By contrast, conditionalist I-A items systematize from E/N statements without overriding any of them.

### Study Area 10: The Sodom Paradigm (etc5-05, 06, 11, 13, 15)

Scripture's own designated example of "eternal fire" is Sodom. Jude 1:7 states Sodom suffered "the vengeance of eternal fire [puros aiōniou]." The same author in the same letter-tradition: "turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes [tephroō]" (2 Pet 2:6). Jesus: fire "destroyed them all" (Luk 17:29). The fire that Jude calls "eternal" is the fire whose result was total destruction — ashes. N029 establishes: "eternal fire" denotes a fire whose result is permanent and irrevocable, not a fire that continues burning forever. This appears in five separate studies without artificial imposition. When Scripture uses the same language (eternal fire) for Sodom and for the fate of the wicked, and Scripture itself defines what Sodom's eternal fire produced (ashes, complete destruction, "destroyed them all"), the definition governs subsequent uses of the same language.

### Study Area 11: The Positional Tally

The positional tally is required by the series methodology and must account for all 410 deduplicated items. The tally appears in full in the Final Positional Tally section above:

- E-tier: Conditionalist 128, ECT 0, Neutral 184 (Total 312)
- N-tier: Conditionalist 27, ECT 0, Neutral 19 (Total 46)
- I-A tier: Conditionalist 25, ECT 0, Neutral 3 (Total 28)
- I-B tier: 18 total (2 Strong conditionalist, 15 Moderate all against ECT or toward conditionalist, 1 Unresolved)
- I-C tier: Conditionalist 3, ECT 0, Neutral 0 (Total 3)
- I-D tier: Conditionalist 0, ECT 3, Neutral 0 (Total 3)

The tally is sourced from etc5-master-evidence.md and verified against PROMPT.md.

## What Can Be Said with Confidence

The following conclusions are supported at E-tier or N-tier — both sides must acknowledge these as textual observations:

**On human nature:**
1. Man is mortal by creation; immortality is not a present human possession
2. God alone currently possesses immortality as an inherent attribute (1 Tim 6:16: monos echon athanasian)
3. The soul/nephesh can die; Ezk 18:4 states "the soul that sinneth, it shall die" with nephesh as the grammatical subject
4. God can destroy both soul and body (Mat 10:28 — explicit statement)
5. All 18 NT immortality-term occurrences apply to God alone or to the future resurrection state; zero apply to present human possession
6. Immortality is sought, put on, and obtained at resurrection — it is not currently possessed

**On the vocabulary of judgment:**
7. The dominant scriptural vocabulary for the fate of the wicked is destruction vocabulary (~2,060+ occurrences across 15+ word families throughout both testaments)
8. Torment vocabulary (basanizō/basanismos) appears 18 times in eschatological contexts, all in Revelation's apocalyptic imagery
9. The two vocabulary sets are lexically non-overlapping (N033): no NT text uses both for the same event on the same subject
10. Paul's summary word for the fate of sinners in Romans 2 is apollumi (perish/be destroyed)
11. Paul's eschatological noun is olethros (destruction) — he never uses basanismos for the fate of the wicked in the epistles
12. The negative resurrection in John 5:29 is named anastasim kriseōs (verdict/judgment), not anastasim basanismou (torment)
13. All 10 major judgment passages use judicial and destruction vocabulary, not torment vocabulary
14. Torment vocabulary is absent from all 12 NT gehenna passages; gehenna passages use apollumi

**On the second death:**
15. The second death IS the lake of fire — by explicit textual identification twice (Rev 20:14; Rev 21:8)
16. The word used is thanatos (standard Greek death word, G2288), not basanismos (torment)
17. The overcomer exemption from the second death confirms it is a genuine death-outcome

**On "forever" language:**
18. Olam and aionios are contextually determined by the subject's nature (N034, N035)
19. Aionios cannot be inherently "forward-pointing endless" — it refers to past elapsed time in three NT passages (N036)
20. Aidios (from aei = always) carries inherent endlessness; Paul chose aidios for God's power and aionios for punishment language
21. Scripture's own designated "eternal fire" example (Sodom) produced ashes — the Bible's own definition governs

**On the torment passages:**
22. The torment formula in Rev 20:10 is applied to three named supernatural/symbolic entities (devil, beast, false prophet)
23. Rev 20:15 casts human wicked into the lake of fire without repeating the torment formula
24. The smoke-ascending formula in Rev 19:3 is applied to Babylon ("found no more at all") by the same author in the same book (IB009 STRONG)
25. All 18 I-B items resolved by the SIS protocol; zero resolved toward ECT; 2 resolved STRONG toward conditionalist direction

**On the ECT argument structure:**
26. Zero ECT arguments reach the N (Necessary Implication) tier for the universal claim that all human wicked experience ongoing conscious torment forever
27. All 7 former ECT E-items were reclassified to Neutral: four pertained to the intermediate state of the righteous (grammar doesn't state simultaneity; contradicts E013-E022); one was parabolic narrative in temporary hades (contradicts E013-E022); two were in Revelation's symbolic genre with grammar (E211) showing "forever" attaches to smoke, not persons

## What Remains Genuinely Contested

The following questions are at the I-B tier (competing evidence), meaning genuine textual evidence exists on both sides:

**IB004 (UNRESOLVED):** Whether substance dualism or holistic dichotomy correctly characterizes the human person. Both positions have textual evidence; the question involves how to read ontological claims from functional statements. This is the only I-B item that ends the 18-study series without resolution.

**IB001 (Moderate, not Strong):** The intermediate state of the righteous. IB001 resolved Moderate against conscious intermediate state — but the naming of Lazarus (E220) and the intermediate-state passages (E038, E039, E050, E052) prevent Strong resolution. The intermediate state remains at Moderate.

**Rev 20:10 and the three entities:** IB015 resolved Moderate toward permanent/irrevocable. The torment formula's application to the devil, beast, and false prophet is a genuine explicit statement (E149). Whether this formula extends to human wicked is prevented by IB008 and IB016 (both Moderate against universal extension), but the passage itself is not contested — its subject class and scope are.

**The genre of Revelation overall:** The book's self-description as esēmainō (communicate through signs, Rev 1:1) establishes its visionary-symbolic mode, but the precise boundary between symbolic imagery and literal statement within the book involves ongoing interpretive judgment at the I-B tier.

## Investigative Conclusion

The classification of 410 deduplicated evidence items across 17 systematic studies produces the following data:

**E-tier position:** 128 Conditionalist E-items; 0 ECT E-items; 184 Neutral E-items. The 7 items previously classified as ECT were reclassified to Neutral after the etc5-18 audit found that each depended on assumptions not present in the text when grammar, context, and harmony with other explicit statements are applied: (a) E038/E039/E050/E052 — intermediate state passages whose ECT reading requires adding simultaneity the grammar doesn't state and contradicts multiple explicit statements about the dead; (b) E123 — parabolic narrative contradicting the clear didactic statements of E013-E022; (c) E149/E150 — Revelation passages where grammar (E211), within-book parallels (Rev 19:3), and genre (esēmainō) all argue against the ECT reading.

**N-tier position:** 27 Conditionalist N-items; 0 ECT N-items. The N-tier (necessary implication from explicit statements without adding external concepts) generates evidence exclusively in the conditionalist direction.

**I-A position:** 25 Conditionalist I-A items; 0 ECT I-A items. Evidence-extending inferences from E/N statements (without overriding any E/N statement) generate evidence exclusively in the conditionalist direction.

**I-B position:** 2 Strong conditionalist resolutions; 15 Moderate resolutions all either toward conditionalist or against ECT; 1 Unresolved; 0 ECT resolutions.

**I-C position:** 3 Conditionalist; 0 ECT.

**I-D position:** 0 Conditionalist; 3 ECT. The ECT position requires three items that override explicit statements (E024/N007: soul can die; E026/N008: God can destroy the soul; E029/N005 + E031/N006: God alone has immortality, immortality is obtained at resurrection).

The weight and direction of the classified evidence base — assessed tier by tier across E, N, I-A, I-B, I-C, and I-D categories — is more consistent with conditionalism than with eternal conscious torment.

The one genuinely unresolved question (IB004: substance dualism vs. holistic dichotomy) pertains to the ontological composition of the human person, not directly to the question of whether the wicked experience ongoing conscious torment or cessation of existence. Its resolution in either direction does not determine the outcome vocabulary that Scripture uses throughout both testaments for the fate of the wicked.
