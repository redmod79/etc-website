## Study-by-Study Summary

---

### Study 01: etc5-01-what-is-man

**Tally:** 60 E (E001–E060), 12 N (N001–N012), 8 I-A, 5 I-B, 1 I-C, 2 I-D = **88 total**

**I-B Status at end of this study:**
- IB001 (conscious intermediate state): Unresolved
- IB002 (under-the-sun qualifier): Moderate — against ECT implication
- IB003 (trichotomy): Moderate — against
- IB004 (substance dualism): Unresolved
- IB005 (spirit returns = conscious): Moderate — toward life-force reading

**Key E Items:**
- E001: Gen 2:7 — man became (not received) a living soul (nephesh chayyah)
- E005: Ecc 9:5 — dead know not any thing; reward of memory forgotten
- E008: Psa 146:4 — breath departs, thoughts perish, returns to earth that very day
- E011: Job 14:12 — shall not awake, nor be raised out of sleep
- E015: Isa 38:18 — Sheol cannot praise God; death cannot celebrate God
- E017: Ecc 9:10 — no work, device, knowledge, or wisdom in sheol
- E021: 1 Tim 6:16 — God alone has immortality (athanasia)
- E023: Dan 12:2 — many sleep in the dust; awake to everlasting life or everlasting contempt
- E026: Mat 10:28 — fear him who can destroy both soul and body in gehenna
- E029: Ezk 18:4 — the soul that sinneth, it shall die

**Key N Items:**
- N001: Man is mortal by creation; has no inherent immortality
- N002: God alone possesses immortality in himself
- N003: Death is not merely physical; soul/nephesh can cease to exist
- N004: The dead do not praise God, communicate, or have conscious activity
- N005: Immortality is not a present human possession but a future resurrection gift

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-01):**
1. Man was formed from dust and breath of life; he became a living soul (nephesh chayyah) — he did not receive one
2. The word nephesh (soul) applies equally to animals and humans; it does not denote an immortal, separable entity
3. God alone has athanasia (deathlessness, immortality) — 1 Tim 6:16 states this explicitly
4. At death, the breath/spirit (ruach) returns to God; the thoughts perish; the body returns to dust
5. The dead know not anything (Ecc 9:5); they do not praise God or communicate with the living (Psa 6:5; 115:17; Isa 38:18)
6. Death is consistently compared to sleep by multiple independent biblical authors (Job, Psalms, Daniel, Jesus, Paul)
7. The soul (nephesh/psyche) can die — Ezk 18:4 ("the soul that sinneth, it shall die") and Mat 10:28 ("destroy both soul and body in gehenna")

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-01):**
1. The Bible explicitly states that the soul is inherently immortal and cannot die
2. The ruach returning to God at death means conscious personal presence with God (IB005 moderate against)
3. Ecc 9:5 ("dead know not any thing") is restricted to earthly perspective only and does not reflect actual post-mortem state (IB002 moderate against that restriction)
4. Nephesh refers exclusively to an incorporeal, immortal entity distinct from the body

### Study 02: etc5-02-who-has-immortality

**Tally:** 28 E (E061–E088), 7 N (N013–N019), 3 I-A (IA009–IA011), 0 I-B new, 0 I-C new, 1 I-D new (ID003) = **39 total**

**I-B Status:** IB001 remained Unresolved; additional weight added against; ID003 new (against "monos = preeminence only" argument)

**Key E Items:**
- E063: 1 Tim 6:16 — God has immortality; dwelling in unapproachable light; no man hath seen
- E064: 1 Cor 15:53-54 — we must put on incorruption/immortality (future, at resurrection)
- E065: Luke 20:35-36 — those accounted worthy of the resurrection cannot die any more; equal to angels
- E068: 1 Jn 5:11-12 — life is in the Son; he that hath the Son hath life; he that hath not the Son hath not life
- E073: Rom 2:7 — immortality is something believers seek for; not something they already possess

**Key N Items:**
- N013: All 3 NT athanasia occurrences apply either to God (1 Tim 6:16) or to the future resurrection state (1 Cor 15:53-54); no NT occurrence applies to current human possession
- N014: The deathless state is a resurrection-state, not a current human condition
- N015: Immortality is granted by God through the Son; it is not inherent

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-02):**
1. All 3 NT occurrences of athanasia (immortality) apply to God alone or to the future resurrection state — never to a present human soul
2. All 9 NT occurrences of aphtharsia (incorruption) are distributed similarly — given or put on at resurrection, not currently possessed
3. Immortality is "sought for" (Rom 2:7) and "put on" (1 Cor 15:53-54) — not already possessed
4. The deathless state comes through resurrection: Luke 20:35-36 says those accounted worthy of the resurrection "cannot die any more"
5. Life is in the Son: those without the Son do not have life (1 Jn 5:12)
6. God "only" has immortality (monos echon athanasian, 1 Tim 6:16) — the Greek word monos is unambiguous: uniquely, solely

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-02):**
1. Any NT text applies athanasia or aphtharsia to the present human soul as a currently possessed attribute
2. The phrase "immortal soul" appears anywhere in Scripture
3. The soul is inherently exempt from death based on its nature
4. Human beings currently possess immortality; they merely need to be released from the body to enjoy it

### Study 03: etc5-03-biblical-death

**Tally:** 39 E (E089–E127), 5 N (N020–N024), 3 I-A (IA012–IA014), 2 I-B new (IB006 Unresolved; IB007 Moderate), 0 I-C, 0 I-D = **49 total**

**I-B New in this study:**
- IB006 (Luke 16 literal hades description): Unresolved — genre question cannot be resolved from text alone at this stage
- IB007 (Luke 20:38 = present consciousness): Moderate — toward resurrection-certainty reading

**Key E Items:**
- E089: Gen 3:19 — dust thou art; to dust shalt thou return
- E090: Rom 6:23 — wages of sin is death; gift of God is eternal life
- E091: Jhn 3:16 — should not perish (apollumi) but have everlasting life
- E095: 1 Cor 15:18 — then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished (apollumi)
- E099: 1 Th 4:13-16 — we sorrow not for those who sleep; the dead in Christ shall rise first
- E108: Rev 2:11 — he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death
- E110: Rev 20:14 — death and hell cast into lake of fire: THIS IS the second death
- E113: Rev 21:8 — lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which IS the second death
- E114: Jhn 3:16 — should not perish (apollumi) — uses destruction vocabulary
- E116: 2 Th 1:9 — everlasting destruction (olethron aionion) from the presence of the Lord

**Key N Items:**
- N020: Death is not sleep in the sense of semiconsciousness; it is the cessation of life activity, described by multiple authors as "not waking until"
- N021: The second death IS the lake of fire — explicit textual identification (Rev 20:14; 21:8)
- N022: Death and life are antithetical outcomes — not two modes of existence, but existence vs. cessation
- N023: The dead lack consciousness — multiple independent authors (Job, Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Isaiah) state this consistently

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-03):**
1. Three death registers are identified in Scripture: physical death, spiritual alienation from God, and eschatological second death
2. The second death IS the lake of fire — by explicit textual identification (Rev 20:14; 21:8)
3. Apollumi (G622) is the primary NT word for the eschatological fate of the wicked — 92 NT occurrences; meaning: perish, be destroyed, come to ruin
4. Death and life are presented as antitheses throughout Scripture (Jhn 3:16; Rom 6:23; Jhn 5:24)
5. The remedy for death is consistently resurrection, not release of a pre-existing immortal soul
6. "Dead in Christ" who die without resurrection have "perished" (apollumi) — 1 Cor 15:18

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-03):**
1. The second death is the same as eternal conscious torment — the text uses the word "death" (thanatos), not "torment" (basanismos)
2. Apollumi means only "lose" or "be separated from" in its eschatological uses — the word means perish/ruin/destruction
3. Death in Scripture always means biological cessation without further implication — the second death is a distinct eschatological event

### Study 04: etc5-04-state-of-the-dead

**Tally:** 9 E (E128–E136), 2 N (N025–N026), 1 I-A (IA015), 0 I-B new, 1 I-C (IC002), 0 I-D = **13 total**

**CRITICAL: IB001 resolution updated:** Shifted from Unresolved to **Moderate AGAINST conscious intermediate state**

**Key E Items:**
- E128: 1 Cor 15:18 — if no resurrection, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished (apollumi)
- E129: Rev 14:13 — blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; they rest from their labors
- E130: Acts 2:29 — David dead and buried; his sepulchre with us unto this day (as of Pentecost)
- E131: Acts 2:31 — he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ; that his soul was not left in hell (hades)
- E134: Rev 20:13 — the sea gave up the dead; death and hell delivered up the dead
- E136: 1 Cor 15:20 — now is Christ risen; the firstfruits of them that slept

**Key N Items:**
- N025: Between death and resurrection, the dead are in a state of "not living" per Rev 20:5 ("the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished")
- N026: Hades is a temporary holding state — it receives the dead, holds them until resurrection, delivers them up, and is then destroyed (cast into the lake of fire at Rev 20:14)

**Key SIS Connections established:**
- 1 Cor 15:18 (#4a) governs Phil 1:23 — if resurrection is needed, "being with Christ" at death cannot be a separate conscious state
- Acts 2:31 (#4a, intra-Lukan) governs Luk 23:43 — Luke's own framework for hades as pre-resurrection location
- Rev 20:4-5 (#4a) governs Rev 6:9-11 — the martyrs' living is the first resurrection, not an intermediate state

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-04):**
1. The dead are consistently described in the Bible as not conscious, not knowing, not praising God until resurrection
2. Hades is a temporary pre-resurrection holding state — it is cast into the lake of fire at Rev 20:14
3. The SIS connections between Luke 23:43 and Acts 2:31, and between Phil 1:23 and 1 Cor 15:18, establish that the intermediate-state proof-texts must be read within the resurrection framework
4. IB001 (conscious intermediate state) is now Moderate AGAINST — the weight of the plain passages outweighs the contextually-clear intermediate-state passages

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-04):**
1. The intermediate state of the dead is one of conscious existence — IB001 is now Moderate AGAINST this
2. Hades = the lake of fire — the text explicitly distinguishes them (Rev 20:14)
3. Luke 23:43 ("today in paradise") establishes ECT — Acts 2:31 (same author) places Christ's soul in hades until the resurrection

### Study 05: etc5-05-four-hell-words

**Tally:** 14 E (E137–E150), 3 N (N027–N029), 2 I-A new (IA016–IA017), 1 I-B new (IB008 Moderate), 0 I-C, 0 I-D = **20 total**

**I-B New:**
- IB008 (whether ongoing torment language extends universally to all in lake of fire): Moderate — **AGAINST universal extension**

**Key E Items:**
- E137: H7585 (sheol) rendered with 25 distinct KJV English phrases across its occurrences
- E138: LXX translates sheol as hades 58/67 times (PMI 33.87) — dominant, non-accidental association
- E143: Torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos) is entirely absent from all 12 gehenna passages
- E144: Mark 9:48's worm/fire refrain is a direct quotation of Isa 66:24 (tool-confirmed: score 0.424)
- E145: G5020 (tartaroo) = 1 NT occurrence only; applied to fallen angels, not to the human wicked
- E146: Angels in tartaroo are in "chains of darkness" — pre-judgment temporary custody
- E147: Jude 1:7 — eternal fire on Sodom; 2 Pet 2:6 — Sodom turned to ashes (same event)
- E149: Rev 20:10 — devil, beast, and false prophet tormented day and night for ever and ever (ECT E-tier)
- E150: Rev 14:10-11 — beast-worshippers tormented; smoke of their torment ascends for ever (ECT E-tier)

**Key N Items:**
- N027: Sheol and hades are the same reality across testaments — not separate
- N028: Gehenna and sheol/hades are distinct, describing different eschatological stages
- N029: "Eternal fire" in biblical usage denotes a fire whose result is permanent — not a fire that continues burning forever; Sodom example: eternal fire = ashes

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-05):**
1. The four "hell" words in English translation (sheol, hades, gehenna, tartaroo) describe distinct realities
2. Sheol and hades are the same concept — the common destination of ALL the dead, righteous and wicked alike
3. Gehenna is the Valley of Hinnom; it is the eschatological judgment destination; torment vocabulary is entirely absent from all 12 NT gehenna passages; gehenna uses destruction vocabulary (apollumi)
4. Tartaroo appears once in the NT (2 Pet 2:4), applied only to fallen angels in pre-judgment custody
5. E149 (Rev 20:10) and E150 (Rev 14:10-11) are genuine ECT-direction E-tier items — both describe explicit torment in Revelation
6. The Sodom paradigm is Scripture's own designated example of "eternal fire" — it produced ashes (2 Pet 2:6; Jude 1:7)

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-05):**
1. Gehenna describes a place of ongoing conscious torment — torment vocabulary is absent from every gehenna passage
2. Sheol and hades are the same as gehenna or the lake of fire — they are distinct in every textual analysis
3. The torment language of Rev 14:10-11 (E150) extends universally to all the human wicked — IB008 Moderate AGAINST universal extension
4. Tartaroo describes the final state of the human wicked — it applies only to fallen angels

---

### Study 06: etc5-06-destruction-vocabulary

**Tally:** 34 E (E151–E184), 4 N (N030–N033), 3 I-A (IA018–IA020), 2 I-B new (IB009 Moderate; IB010 Moderate), 0 I-C, 0 I-D = **43 total**

**I-B New:**
- IB009 (smoke ascending forever = desolation vs. torment): Moderate — toward permanent-desolation imagery
- IB010 (2Th 1:9 apo prosopou = banishment vs. source): Moderate — AGAINST banishment reading

**Key E Items:**
- E151: Psa 37:20 — wicked shall perish; enemies of the Lord shall be consumed into smoke; they shall consume into smoke
- E152: Mal 4:1 — day cometh that shall burn like an oven; all the proud shall be stubble; it shall leave them neither root nor branch
- E153: Mal 4:3 — ye shall tread down the wicked; they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet
- E154: Obad 1:16 — they shall be as though they had not been (non-existence expression)
- E161: 2 Pet 2:6 — turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes (tephroō); condemned with overthrow
- E162: Psa 92:7,9 — shall be destroyed for ever (shamad + abad); wicked shall perish
- E168: G622 (apollumi) — 92 NT occurrences; primary eschatological destruction word
- E171: G928 (basanizo) and G929 (basanismos) NEVER translate any Hebrew destruction term in the LXX
- E172: G929 (basanismos) — 6 NT occurrences, ALL in Revelation only
- E174: H6 (abad) — LXX maps abad to apollumi 141x (PMI 6.14) — strongest LXX H→G destruction bridge
- E181: G622 (apollumi) = 92 NT occurrences; G928 (basanizo) = 12 total, eschatological basanizo confined to Revelation
- E182: Isa 34:10 — smoke shall go up for ever; cross-testament tool confirms this as highest OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (score 0.401)

**Key N Items:**
- N030: The OT and NT destruction vocabularies describe cessation/ruin — not ongoing torment
- N031: The LXX H6 (abad) → G622 (apollumi) bridge confirms the Hebrew and Greek destruction vocabularies are semantically equivalent
- N032: The destruction imagery consistently depicts cessation: chaff burned up, wax melting, smoke dissipating, ashes remaining
- N033: The basanizo/basanismos torment vocabulary and the apollumi/abad destruction vocabulary are lexically non-overlapping; no NT text uses both for the same event applied to the same subject

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-06):**
1. 15+ Hebrew/Greek destruction word families with ~2,060+ occurrences describe the wicked's fate using cessation/ruin imagery throughout both testaments
2. Torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos) is confined to Revelation — 6 total occurrences of basanismos, 12 of basanizo — and NEVER appears in the didactic epistles or the gehenna passages
3. The LXX confirms the Hebrew/Greek vocabulary bridge: H6 (abad) → G622 (apollumi), PMI 6.14 — non-accidental, dominant correspondence
4. Non-existence expressions appear in multiple passages: Psa 37 cluster ("shall not be"); Obad 1:16 ("as though they had not been")
5. Isa 34:10 is the tool-confirmed #1 OT parallel for Rev 14:11 — an Edom desolation passage where the aftermath is animals dwelling in an abandoned wasteland

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-06):**
1. The destruction vocabulary describes ongoing conscious torment — it consistently describes cessation/ruin
2. Apollumi means something other than actual destruction in its eschatological uses
3. The two vocabulary sets (destruction and torment) are interchangeable or describe the same experience

---

### Study 07: etc5-07-olam-forever-in-ot

**Tally:** 12 E (E185–E196), 2 N (N034–N035), 1 I-A (IA021), 1 I-B new (IB011 Moderate), 0 I-C, 0 I-D = **16 total**

**I-B New:**
- IB011 (Dan 12:2 grammatical symmetry vs. referent-nature interpretation): Moderate — toward referent-nature

**Key E Items:**
- E185: H5769 (olam) defined: "properly, concealed, i.e. the vanishing point; time out of mind (past or future)"
- E186: H5769 rendered by 40+ distinct KJV English words across 432 occurrences
- E187: Exo 21:6 le-olam slave — bounded by mortality
- E189: Jon 2:6 le-olam in fish belly (72 hours)
- E191: Hab 3:6 — same verse: olam hills scattered AND olam God's ways endure (same-verse demonstration)
- E192: Isa 34:11-17 — animals dwelling in Edom's desolation immediately after smoke-for-ever announcement
- E193: Dir'on (H1860) occurs only in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24; in Isa 66:24 the objects of the dir'on are pigrê (corpses)
- E194: Jer 51:57 — shnat-olam (perpetual sleep) + lo yaqitzu (shall not wake); same qits root as Dan 12:2 yaqitzu (awakening)
- E195: LXX bridge: H5769 → G165 (aion) 287x PMI 5.55; H5769 → G166 (aionios) 100x PMI 5.67

**Key N Items:**
- N034: The duration olam denotes in any given use is determined by the nature and context of the subject, not by the word itself (established by Hab 3:6: same word, same verse, demonstrably different durations)
- N035: NT G166 (aionios) carries the semantic range of Hebrew H5769 (olam), including age-pertaining quality with actual duration contextually determined, via the LXX bridge

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-07):**
1. H5769 (olam) has 40+ KJV renderings — it is contextually determined vocabulary, not an absolute
2. Multiple passages use olam for durations bounded by death, historical events, or explicit "until" clauses
3. Hab 3:6 uses olam in the same verse for destructible mountains and for God's enduring ways — same word, demonstrably different durations
4. Dan 12:2 uses olam (through LXX G166) for both everlasting life and everlasting contempt — symmetry governs both, but N034 shows duration depends on the subject's nature
5. The LXX bridge establishes that NT aionios carries olam's semantic range — not a philosophical absolute, but "age-pertaining/permanent" with duration contextually determined

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-07):**
1. Olam inherently means "infinite duration" in all contexts
2. The Dan 12:2 symmetry (same olam for both outcomes) establishes that both outcomes must be infinite in duration — N034 prevents this inference
3. Aionios automatically means "without end" regardless of the referent's nature

**Tally:** 22 E (E197–E218), 2 N (N036–N037), 1 I-A (IA022), 1 I-B new (IB012 Moderate), 0 I-C, 0 I-D = **26 total**

**I-B New:**
- IB012 (Mat 25:46 grammatical symmetry vs. referent-nature): Moderate — toward referent-nature interpretation

**Key E Items:**
- E197: G166 (aionios) BLB definition explicitly acknowledges bidirectionality: "perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well)"
- E199: G126 (aidios) defined "everduring (forward and backward, or forward)" from G104 (aei = "always/continually")
- E200: G126 (aidios) has only 2 NT occurrences: Romans 1:20 and Jude 1:6
- E201: Paul used aidios for God's power (Rom 1:20) but aionios for eternal life throughout the same epistle
- E202: Jude 1:6-7 — aidios for angels' ongoing confinement; aionios for Sodom's completed fire (= ashes per 2 Pet 2:6)
- E203: Tit 1:2 — same verse contains aionios for forward-looking eternal life AND backward-looking past ages
- E204: Rom 16:25 — chronois aioniois = elapsed past ages (KJV: "since the world began")
- E207: Heb 9:12 — aionios for eternal redemption obtained once-for-all (ephapax); completed act, permanent result
- E208: Mat 25:46 — both aionion instances are A-ASF — grammatically identical
- E209: Kolasis (G2851) in Mat 25:46 = "penal infliction" from kolazo (prune/curtail); NOT basanismos
- E211: Rev 14:11 — ho kapnos (the smoke, N-NSM) is the NOMINATIVE grammatical subject of anabainei; smoke ascends, not persons
- E212: Rev 20:10 names three specific subjects of torment; Rev 20:15 casts human wicked into lake without repeating formula

**Key N Items:**
- N036: Aionios cannot be inherently forward-pointing endless, because it demonstrably refers to past elapsed time in three NT passages by two different authors
- N037: Aionios (aion + -ios = denominal adjective) is not an alpha-privative formation and therefore does not inherently assert infinite duration; aidios (from aei = "always") is the word for inherent endlessness

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-08):**
1. Aionios is a denominal adjective derived from aion — meaning "age-pertaining" or "pertaining to the age"
2. Aionios demonstrably refers to past elapsed time in three NT passages (Rom 16:25; 2Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2) — it cannot be inherently "forward-pointing endless"
3. Aidios (G126) is the Greek word carrying inherent endlessness (from aei = always); Paul deliberately used aidios for God's power but aionios for punishment language
4. The event-noun pattern in Hebrews: aionios modifies "eternal redemption," "eternal salvation," "eternal judgment" — all completed acts with permanent results
5. The Jude 1:6-7 within-letter contrast: aidios for ongoing angel confinement; aionios for Sodom's completed fire (= ashes)
6. Mat 25:46 uses kolasis (punishment/pruning), not basanismos (torment), for the negative outcome — IB012 governs the symmetry inference

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-08):**
1. Aionios inherently means "without end" in all its occurrences — past-time uses refute this
2. The grammatical symmetry of Mat 25:46 (same adjective for both outcomes) necessarily means both have identical duration — IB012 Moderate toward referent-nature
3. "Eternal punishment" in Mat 25:46 is equivalent to "eternal torment" — the word is kolasis (pruning/curtailing), not basanismos (torment)

### Study 09: etc5-09-rich-man-lazarus

**Tally:** 12 E (E219–E230), 1 N (N038), 0 I-A new, 0 I-B new, 0 I-C, 0 I-D = **13 total**

**CRITICAL: IB006 resolved:** From Unresolved to **Moderate — weight toward parabolic/literary genre interpretation**

**Key E Items:**
- E219: Luke 16:19 opening formula ("There was a certain rich man") = same as Luke 12:16 and Luke 16:1; both also used in parabolic contexts
- E220: Lazarus is the only named human character in any parable of Jesus — genuine anomaly that prevents Strong resolution
- E222: Chasma (gulf) — hapax legomenon; permanently fixed (perfect passive)
- E223: Luke 16:29,31 — stated theological purpose: sufficiency of Moses and the Prophets
- E224: Luke 15:3 introduces three consecutive unlabeled parables under one parabolē label
- E225: Luke 12:16 explicitly labels "certain rich man" formula as parabolē
- E226: Mat 8:29 — demons say "to torment us before the time" — torment is explicitly future
- E227: Luke 16 uses basanos/odunaomai; G929 (basanismos) — absent from Luke 16

**Key N Items:**
- N038: Even on a literal reading, Luke 16:23 describes hades (temporary pre-resurrection state per N026), not gehenna or the lake of fire — cannot establish ECT as the FINAL post-judgment fate

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-09):**
1. Luke 16:19-31 is most appropriately classified as a parable — same literary formula as labeled parables; discourse-level parabolic context
2. The passage's own stated purpose is the sufficiency of Moses and the Prophets (vv.29-31)
3. Even on a literal reading, the passage describes hades (temporary per N026), not the lake of fire
4. N038: A literal reading of Luke 16 cannot establish eternal conscious torment as the final post-judgment state of human wicked
5. The naming of Lazarus is a genuine anomaly that prevents Strong resolution — IB006 is Moderate, not Strong

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-09):**
1. Luke 16:19-31 literally and straightforwardly proves eternal conscious torment as the final fate of the wicked — even on a literal reading, the setting is pre-resurrection hades
2. The absence of a parabolē label in Luke 16:19 proves the passage is non-parabolic — Luke's practice is to cover consecutive parables with a single label
3. Abraham's bosom = paradise — paradeisos (G3857) does not appear in Luke 16

### Study 10: etc5-10-souls-under-altar

**Tally:** 19 E (E231–E249), 3 N (N039–N041), 0 I-A new, 1 I-B new (IB013 STRONG), 0 I-C, 0 I-D = **23 total**
**CRITICAL RECLASSIFICATION: E051 changed from ECT to Neutral**

**I-B New:**
- IB013 (Rev 6:9-11 literal conscious intermediate state vs. personification): **STRONG** — toward personification/blood-testimony reading

**Key E Items:**
- E231: Rev 1:1 — esēmainō (to communicate through signs) — the book's self-described communication mode
- E232: Rev 6:8 — Death and Hades as horsemen — explicit personification in same chapter
- E233: Rev 16:7 — the altar itself speaks (inanimate object attributed speech within Revelation)
- E234: Gen 4:10 — dead Abel's blood cries from the ground (foundational blood-crying pattern)
- E235: Heb 11:4 — Abel being dead "yet speaketh" through his sacrifice, not through consciousness
- E236: Rev 6:10 is the top NT parallel for Gen 4:10 (cross-testament tool: score 0.330)
- E238: Lev 17:11 — nephesh = blood given upon the altar (establishing the altar-imagery framework)
- E240: Rev 20:4 vocabulary identical to Rev 6:9; martyrs "lived" = called "first resurrection" in Rev 20:5
- E241: Rev 20:5 — rest of dead lived not again until thousand years; "THIS IS the first resurrection"
- E242: Rev 6:11 and Rev 14:13 use identical anapausōntai (same verb, same form, same author, same book)

**Key N Items:**
- N039: In Revelation's visionary genre, inanimate objects speak (altar, Rev 16:7) — speech-attribution does not require consciousness
- N040: Rev 6:9 martyrs and Rev 20:4 martyrs are the same group by shared vocabulary
- N041: The martyrs' "living" (ezēsan) in Rev 20:4 is explicitly called "the first resurrection" — their living is a resurrection event, not an intermediate state

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-10):**
1. Revelation 6:9-11 is embedded in an apocalyptic vision sequence in which Death and Hades appear as personified horsemen and the altar itself speaks (same book, same author)
2. The souls are positioned under the altar — exactly where Levitical sacrificial blood was poured (Lev 4:7)
3. Genesis 4:10 (dead Abel's blood cries) is the top NT parallel for Rev 6:10 (tool-verified) — the blood-crying-for-justice convention applies to dead Abel
4. The martyrs of Rev 6:9-11 and Rev 20:4-5 are the same group; their "living" is explicitly called "the first resurrection"
5. IB013 resolves STRONG toward personification/blood-testimony — multiple Plain SIS connections from within Revelation govern

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-10):**
1. Revelation 6:9-11 explicitly states the souls are literally conscious disembodied spirits — the passage uses apocalyptic imagery with strong OT personification parallels
2. The "how long" formula proves consciousness of the speaker — it is used by living persons, by communities for the slain, and by angels
3. White robes given to the souls prove they are literally conscious — robes in Revelation symbolize righteous standing (Rev 19:8)

**Tally:** 9 E (E250–E258), 0 N new, 0 I-A new, 1 I-B new (IB014 Moderate), 0 I-C, 0 I-D = **10 total**
**CRITICAL UPDATE: IB009 upgraded from Moderate to STRONG**

**I-B Updated:**
- IB009: Upgraded from Moderate to **STRONG — toward literary formula / permanent-desolation imagery**

**I-B New:**
- IB014 ("no rest day nor night" = ongoing torment vs. judgment-process): Moderate — toward judgment-process

**Key E Items:**
- E250: Rev 19:3 — identical formula (kapnos + anabainei + eis tous aionas ton aionon) for Babylon, described as "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21); same book, same author, completed destruction
- E251: G929 (basanismos) in Rev 9:5 describes torment explicitly limited to "five months" — bounded judgment within Revelation
- E252: G929 (basanismos) three times in Rev 18 for Babylon — "in one hour is thy judgment come"
- E253: Rev 4:8 and Rev 14:11 use identical Greek phrase "no rest day and night" — in Rev 4:8 it describes the four living creatures' ceaseless worship
- E255: LXX bridge: H6227 (ashan, smoke) → G2586 (kapnos) as dominant translation (PMI 9.95) — confirming Revelation's kapnos connects to Hebrew ashan in Isa 34:10
- E258: Rev 14:11-13 within a three-verse unit: "no rest" (v.11) immediately followed by blessed dead who "rest from their labors" (v.13) — same root

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-11):**
1. Rev 19:3 applies the identical smoke-for-ever formula to Babylon — described as "found no more at all" — demonstrating the formula can describe completed, permanent judgment
2. Isa 34:10 (smoke ascending forever for Edom) is followed by Isa 34:11-17 showing animals inhabiting a permanently desolated wasteland — not an actively burning place
3. G929 (basanismos) in Rev 9:5 is explicitly time-bounded (five months); in Rev 18 it describes "in one hour" completed destruction — the word does not inherently imply infinite duration
4. The "no rest day nor night" phrase appears in Rev 4:8 for the living creatures' continuous worship — it does not inherently describe suffering

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-11):**
1. The "smoke ascending forever" formula necessarily implies ongoing perpetual conscious experience — IB009 is now STRONG toward permanent desolation reading
2. Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3 use the formula differently — both use the identical Greek formula

### Study 12: etc5-12-tormented-forever

**Tally:** 3 E (E259–E261), 0 N new, 0 I-A new, 1 I-B new (IB015 Moderate), 0 I-C, 0 I-D = **4 total**

**I-B New:**
- IB015 (for-ever formula on active torment verb at Rev 20:10): Moderate — toward permanent/irrevocable judgment of specific supernatural entities; IB009 prevents Strong ECT resolution

**Key E Items:**
- E259: Rev 19:20-21 — beast and false prophet cast "alive" (zontes = present active participle); human remnant slain with sword in same narrative
- E260: Seven wailing/gnashing passages — no G928/G929 (torment vocabulary); no for-ever formula; diverse/incompatible settings indicate parabolic imagery
- E261: Heb 2:14 — katargeō (G2673) for the devil — distinct from apollumi (G622) and basanizō (G928)

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-12):**
1. The torment formula ("tormented day and night for ever and ever") in Rev 20:10 is grammatically applied to exactly three named entities: the devil, the beast, the false prophet
2. The adjacent verse (Rev 20:15) casts the human wicked into the same lake without repeating the torment formula
3. Revelation's designation for the lake of fire when human beings are in view is "the second death" (thanatos), not "torment"
4. The torment vocabulary (G928/G929) in NT eschatological contexts is confined to Revelation — never appears in Paul's epistles or the Synoptic Gospels in eschatological teaching about the human wicked

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-12):**
1. The "tormented day and night for ever and ever" formula is applied to human beings in their final state — no NT passage does this
2. The formula in Rev 20:10 necessarily means ongoing perpetual conscious experience — IB009's within-book demonstration (Rev 19:3) prevents Strong ECT resolution

### Study 13: etc5-13-lake-of-fire-second-death

**Tally:** 6 E (E262–E267), 1 N (N042), 0 I new = **7 total**

**Key E Items:**
- E262: 1 Cor 15:26 + Rev 20:14 + Rev 21:4 sequence traces same event: death announced as last enemy → cast into lake → no more death
- E263: Death and Hades in Rev 20:14 are personified abstractions; same book: Death rides a horse (Rev 6:8)
- E264: Rev 21:4 ("no more death") and Rev 21:8 ("which IS the second death") use the same word thanatos in 4-verse proximity
- E265: Rev 21:7-8 — overcomers inherit all things (v.7) vs. wicked have their portion in the second death (v.8) — consecutive antithesis
- E266: G3041 (limnē = lake) — 5 Revelation occurrences, all for the lake of fire; 4 Luke occurrences for the physical Lake of Gennesaret
- E267: Four distinct casting events in Rev 19:20–20:15 with distinct subjects and distinct labels for each

**Key N Items:**
- N042: The abolition of Death in Rev 20:14 is the narrative execution of 1 Cor 15:26 ("last enemy that shall be destroyed is death"); result = Rev 21:4 ("no more death")

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-13):**
1. The second death IS the lake of fire — explicitly identified by Revelation's own equative statement twice (Rev 20:14; 21:8)
2. The word for the second death is thanatos (G2288 = standard Greek death word), not basanismos (torment)
3. The torment-for-ever formula applies only to three named supernatural entities in Rev 20:10; human wicked receive no torment formula in adjacent verses
4. Death personified (Rev 20:14) = the last enemy of 1 Cor 15:26; its abolition enables the "no more death" of Rev 21:4
5. Five lake-of-fire passages with four distinct subject groups; vocabulary is differentiated by subject

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-13):**
1. The lake of fire means "eternal conscious torment" for human wicked — Revelation's own name for it in human-wicked contexts is "second death"
2. The torment-for-ever formula (Rev 20:10) is applied to all inhabitants of the lake of fire — it is applied only to three named supernatural entities

**I-B New:**
- IB016 (Mat 25:41 fire — same experience for humans as for devil/angels?): Moderate — **AGAINST universal extension**
- IB017 (Jhn 5:29 krisis vocabulary = includes torment content?): Moderate — **AGAINST torment-reading of krisis**

**Key E Items:**
- E268: Rev 20:12 — judgment verb is ekrithēsan (krinō = judicial verdict), not basanizō
- E270: Jhn 5:29 — negative resurrection destination is anastasim kriseōs (G2920 = judgment/verdict), NOT anastasim basanismou (torment)
- E272: Heb 10:27 — fire's action is esthiein (G2068 = to eat/devour) — consumption vocabulary, not torment
- E273: Heb 6:2 — "eternal judgment" (krima aiōnion) listed as foundational doctrine; krima = verdict/judicial decision, not torment
- E275: Rom 2:12 — apollōntai (G622, Fut Mid Ind) = Paul's summary word for the fate of the wicked
- E276: Rev 11:18 — diaphtheirai (G1311 = to destroy utterly) for those who destroy the earth
- E278: 2Co 5:10 — bēma (tribunal/raised platform for judicial decisions) of Christ — universal judgment scope, no torment duration stated
- E279: Mat 12:36-37 — katakrithēsē (judicial condemnation) — vocabulary is judicial, not torment

**Key N Items:**
- N043: Evaluation at the Great White Throne uses works (erga) and judicial verb krinō — not basanizō
- N044: Paul's summary word for the fate of sinners in Rom 2:12 is apollumi (perish completely)
- N045: The negative resurrection in Jhn 5:29 is named "resurrection of judgment/condemnation" using krisis (G2920) — not torment (basanismos)
- N046: The fire in Heb 10:27 is described by its consuming/devouring action (esthiein = G2068) — not basanizō

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-14):**
1. All 10 major judgment passages examined (Rev 20:12; Jhn 5:29; 2Th 1:9; Heb 10:27; Heb 6:2; Rom 2:8-12; Acts 24:15; Rev 11:18; Mat 12:36-37; 2Co 5:10) use judicial/forensic vocabulary and destruction vocabulary — not torment vocabulary
2. Torment vocabulary (basanizō/basanismos) is absent from every major judgment passage
3. Paul's summary word for the fate of sinners in Romans 2 is apollumi (perish/be destroyed)
4. The negative resurrection in John 5:29 is named anastasim kriseōs — judgment/verdict vocabulary, not torment vocabulary
5. The Great White Throne evaluates works by written record, using the judicial verb krinō

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-14):**
1. The major judgment passages of the NT describe ongoing conscious torment — they consistently use judicial and destruction vocabulary
2. John 5:29's "resurrection of damnation" inherently includes ongoing eternal torment — the word krisis is judicial vocabulary, not torment vocabulary
3. The fire of Heb 10:27 torments; its action is esthiō (devouring/consuming)

### Study 15: etc5-15-ect-strongest-case

**Tally:** 2 E (E282–E283, both Neutral), 0 N new, 0 I new = **2 total**

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Zero ECT arguments reach the N (Necessary Implication) tier for the universal claim that ALL human wicked experience ongoing conscious torment FOREVER

**Key E Items:**
- E282: Mrk 9:48 verbs "dieth not" (ou teleutai, V-PAI-3S) and "is not quenched" (ou sbennytai, V-PPI-3S) are present-tense; the source text (Isa 66:24) identifies objects as pigrê (corpses)
- E283: In Isa 66:24, dir'on is the predicate describing the attitude of "all flesh" TOWARD the pigrê (corpses) — not the conscious experience of the condemned

**ECT Argument Tier Assessment:**

| Argument | Text | Tier for ECT Doctrine | Governing I-B |
|---------|------|----------------------|--------------|
| Rev 14:9-11 | Human worshippers tormented; smoke for ever | E-fact (E150) + I-B | IB009 Strong + IB008, IB014 Moderate AGAINST |
| Rev 20:10 | Three named entities tormented for ever | E-fact (E149) + I-B | IB015, IB016 Moderate |
| Mat 25:46 | Same adjective for punishment and life | I-B only | IB012 Moderate toward referent-nature |
| Mat 25:41 | Everlasting fire for devil; humans sent into it | I-B only | IB016 Moderate AGAINST |
| Mark 9:43-48 | Worm dieth not; fire not quenched (3x, present tense) | I-B only | IB009 STRONG toward desolation |
| Dan 12:2 | Everlasting contempt parallel to everlasting life | I-B only | IB011 Moderate toward referent-nature |
| Luke 16:23-24 | Rich man in torment explicitly | E-fact (E123) + I-B | IB006 Moderate toward parabolic |
| Isa 66:24 | Worm and fire; shall not die/not quenched | I-B only | IB009 STRONG toward desolation |

**ECT E-Items Confirmed (7 total):**
- E038: 2 Cor 5:8 — absent from body = present with Lord (intermediate state; righteous)
- E039: Phil 1:23 — desire to depart and be with Christ (intermediate state; righteous)
- E050: Luk 23:43 — today in paradise (intermediate state; righteous)
- E052: Heb 12:23 — spirits of just men made perfect (intermediate state; righteous)
- E123: Luk 16:23-25 — rich man in torments in hades (IB006 Moderate toward parabolic)
- E149: Rev 20:10 — tormented for ever (three named supernatural entities)
- E150: Rev 14:10-11 — smoke of torment for ever (beast-worshippers; IB009 STRONG governs formula)

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-15):**
1. Three ECT arguments contain E-tier ECT-direction facts: Rev 14:9-11, Rev 20:10, and Luke 16:23-24
2. Zero ECT arguments reach the N tier for the claim that ALL human wicked experience ongoing conscious torment FOREVER
3. All 8 ECT arguments, assessed for the ECT doctrine inference they support, land at the I-B tier (competing evidence)
4. Mark 9:48's source text (Isa 66:24) explicitly identifies the objects of worm and fire as pigrê (corpses)
5. Dir'on in Isa 66:24 describes the attitude of observers toward the corpses — not the subjective experience of the condemned

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-15):**
1. Any ECT argument from the biblical text reaches the N tier for the universal claim about all human wicked — zero do
2. The Mark 9 worm-and-fire refrain establishes that conscious persons are under eternal torment — the source text identifies the objects as corpses (dead bodies)

### Study 16: etc5-16-origins-of-ect

**Tally:** 5 E (E284–E288, all Neutral), 0 N new, 1 I-A (IA026 Conditionalist), 0 I-B, 1 I-C (IC003 Conditionalist), 0 I-D = **7 total**

**Key E Items:**
- E284: Nave's Topical Bible — GEHENNA and SHEOL both redirect to HELL; the four distinct biblical terms collapsed into one English category
- E285: Nave's TORMENTS entry cites only two passage clusters (Luk 16:23-28; Rev 14:10-11); dominant category is "WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF"
- E286: Nave's FIRE sub-entry for eschatological fire: "Of the DESTRUCTION of the wicked" — not "Of the TORMENT of the wicked"
- E287: G5020 (tartaroo) derives etymologically from Tartaros — the Greek mythological lowest abyss; applied in NT only to fallen angels in pre-judgment custody, not human dead
- E288: G2851 (kolasis) derives from G2849 (kolazo = to prune, curtail, restrain); root etymology emphasizes curtailment, not ongoing torture; 2 NT occurrences only

**New I Items:**
- IA026: The torment vocabulary (G929/G928) is confined entirely to Revelation's apocalyptic context; absent from every Pauline epistle, every General Epistle, and every Synoptic Gospel — while destruction vocabulary pervades all NT didactic teaching
- IC003: Peter's use of tartaroo (Greek mythological term) in a restricted, modified scope (angels only; pre-judgment; darkness not fire) demonstrates non-endorsement of the broader Greek Tartaros cosmology

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-16):**
1. G5020 (tartaroo) is applied only to fallen angels in 2 Pet 2:4 — pre-judgment, in "chains of darkness," not the final fate of human wicked
2. G2851 (kolasis) in Mat 25:46 derives from kolazo (to prune/curtail) — the root emphasizes curtailment, not ongoing torture
3. G929 (basanismos = torment noun) appears in Revelation only; G622 (apollumi = destroy) appears 92 times throughout the NT
4. Nave's Topical Bible frames eschatological fire under "destruction of the wicked," not "torment of the wicked"

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-16):**
1. The date ECT became dominant Christian teaching can be established at E or N tier from Scripture alone — church history is external
2. Peter endorsed the Greek Tartaros cosmology — his use is restricted and modified (scope: angels only; character: darkness, not fire)
3. Kolasis in Mat 25:46 means "ongoing torment" — its root (kolazo = prune/curtail) is from the punishment/pruning lexical domain

**I-B New:**
- IB018 (God's character more consistent with conditionalism vs. ECT): Moderate — **toward conditionalist**

**Key E Items:**
- E289: Gen 18:25 — "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (mishpat = right verdict)
- E290: Deut 32:4 — "His work is perfect... a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he"
- E293: Rev 15:3; 16:5-7; 19:2 — judgment doxologies: "righteous and true" (Rev 16:6 adds proportionality rationale)
- E296: Exo 34:6-7 — God's own self-declaration: merciful, gracious, longsuffering, abundant in goodness and truth; also will not clear the guilty
- E297: Ezk 33:11 — God swears by his life: "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live"
- E298: Hos 11:8-9 — God restrains fierce anger: "I am God, and not man; the Holy One"

- E301: Mic 7:18 — "He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy"
- E302: 2 Pet 3:9 — "not willing (ou boulomai) that any should perish (apollumi), but that all should come to repentance"
- E303: Mat 18:14 — "It is not the will of your Father... that one of these little ones should perish (apollumi)"
- E304: 1 Jn 4:8, 16 — "God is love" (twice; predicate nominative: love is constitutive of God's being)
- E306: Isa 6:3, 5 — "Holy, holy, holy" — absolute holiness with human response of awe at uncleanness
- E307: Hab 1:12-13 — "purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity"
- E310: Rom 9:22 — God endured with much longsuffering even the vessels of wrath whose outcome is named apoleia (destruction)
- E311: Luk 12:47-48 — Jesus explicitly teaches graduated punishment: many stripes vs. few stripes (severity = proportional to knowledge and responsibility)
- E312: Psa 103:10, 14 — God has not dealt with us after our sins; "he remembereth that we are dust"

**New I Items:**
- IA027 *(reclassified from I-A to I-C)*: The graduated punishment principle (Luk 12:47-48) extended to eschatological final punishment — uniform infinite eternal torment inconsistent with stated proportionality
- IA028: The pattern of God's non-desire (not willing apollumi) + non-perpetual wrath = coherent character portrait more consistent with annihilation than ECT

**What CAN Be Said (etc5-17):**
- God's judgment must conform to the standard of what is right/mishpat (Gen 18:25 — E289)
- God is "without iniquity" in all his acts (Deut 32:4 — E290)
- God is righteous in ALL his ways (Psa 145:17 — E291)
- God does not take pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezk 18:23,32; 33:11 — E106, E107, E297)
- God does not will the apollumi/perishing of any (2 Pet 3:9 — E302; Mat 18:14 — E303)
- God "will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth" (Isa 57:15-16 — E299)
- "He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy" (Mic 7:18 — E301)
- God "doth not afflict willingly" (Lam 3:33 — E300)
- Jesus explicitly teaches graduated punishment: many stripes vs. few stripes (Luk 12:47-48 — E311)
- God endured with much longsuffering even toward vessels of wrath whose outcome is named apoleia/destruction (Rom 9:22 — E310)
- "God is love" (1 Jn 4:8,16 — E304)
- God's holiness is absolute — "holy, holy, holy" — and demands that sin be addressed (Isa 6:3,5 — E306; Hab 1:12-13 — E307)

**What CANNOT Be Said (etc5-17):**
- "God's love requires that punishment be remedial/finite" — this is I-B, not stated
- "God's holiness requires infinite eternal conscious torment" — this is I-B, not stated
- "The graduated punishment principle (Luk 12:47-48) proves ECT is impossible" — this is I-A, not N
- "God's non-desire for apollumi proves the wicked will not perish" — this is self-contradictory; God does not desire it but it follows from rejection of repentance
- "God's character requires universalism" — Scripture explicitly states judgment falls on the impenitent
- "The character argument decides the ECT vs. annihilation question definitively" — this is I-B (competing evidence), not E or N
