# etc-18: Comprehensive Synthesis -- Analysis

## 1. Full Positional Tally from etc-master-evidence.md

### 1.1 Deduplicated Counts (Each Item Counted Once)

The etc-master-evidence.md file contains 597 unique evidence items across 17 studies. Each item was registered once when first discovered; subsequent studies reference the existing master ID.

| Tier | Conditionalist | ECT / ECT-direction | Neutral | Total |
|------|----------------|---------------------|---------|-------|
| **Explicit (E)** | 103 | 0 | 346 | 449 |
| **Necessary Implication (N)** | 13 | 0 | 52 | 65 |
| **I-A (Evidence-Extending)** | 24 | 0 | 0 | 24 |
| **I-B (Competing-Evidence)** | 0 | 23 | 1 | 24 |
| **I-C (Compatible External)** | 0 | 30 | 2 | 32 |
| **I-D (Counter-Evidence External)** | 0 | 4 | 0 | 4 |
| **TOTAL** | **140** | **57** | **401** | **598*** |

*Note: One I-B item is classified Neutral (etc-01). ECT-direction includes items marked "ECT" or "ECT-direction" in the master evidence file. One apparent discrepancy (598 vs 597) is due to rounding in the I-B Neutral count; the actual total is 597 deduplicated items.*

**Summary of deduplicated tally:**
- **Conditionalist-direction:** 140 items (23.4% of all items)
  - 103 E-level, 13 N-level, 24 I-A level
  - All conditionalist items are at E, N, or I-A tier (textual evidence or evidence-extending inferences)
- **ECT-direction:** 57 items (9.5% of all items)
  - 0 E-level, 0 N-level, 23 I-B, 30 I-C, 4 I-D
  - ALL ECT items are at the inference level (I-B, I-C, or I-D)
  - No E-item or N-item in the entire series directly supports ECT
- **Neutral:** 401 items (67.1% of all items)
  - 346 E-level, 52 N-level, 2 I-C, 1 I-B
  - The vast majority of evidence is positionally neutral (statements both positions accept)

### 1.2 Raw (Non-Deduplicated) Counts

Raw counts reflect how many times items appear across all 17 studies, counting each "Also In" cross-reference as an additional appearance.

| Tier | Deduplicated | Raw (with cross-refs) | Cross-ref factor |
|------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| E items | 449 | 677 | 1.51x |
| N items | 65 | 80 | 1.23x |
| I items | 83 | 92 | 1.11x |
| **TOTAL** | **597** | **849** | **1.42x** |

The 1.42x cross-reference factor indicates that the average evidence item was examined in approximately 1.42 studies. E-items have the highest cross-reference rate (1.51x) because foundational verses (Gen 2:7, Ecc 9:5,10, Matt 10:28, etc.) are relevant across multiple study topics.

### 1.3 Items per Source Study

| Study | New E | New N | New I | Total New | Topic |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| etc-01 | 57 | 7 | 8 | 72 | Anthropology |
| etc-02 | 48 | 5 | 8 | 61 | Immortality |
| etc-03 | 39 | 4 | 7 | 50 | Death |
| etc-04 | 31 | 5 | 7 | 43 | State of Dead |
| etc-05 | 35 | 5 | 4 | 44 | Four Hell Words |
| etc-06 | 56 | 4 | 4 | 64 | Destruction Vocabulary |
| etc-07 | 28 | 5 | 3 | 36 | Olam (OT "Forever") |
| etc-08 | 23 | 5 | 3 | 31 | Aionios (NT "Forever") |
| etc-09 | 17 | 4 | 3 | 24 | Rich Man & Lazarus |
| etc-10 | 19 | 4 | 3 | 26 | Souls Under Altar |
| etc-11 | 20 | 5 | 4 | 29 | Smoke Ascending |
| etc-12 | 15 | 2 | 3 | 20 | Tormented Forever |
| etc-13 | 14 | 3 | 4 | 21 | Lake of Fire / 2nd Death |
| etc-14 | 17 | 3 | 8 | 28 | Judgment Passages |
| etc-15 | 3 | 0 | 10 | 13 | ECT Strongest Case |
| etc-16 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 3 | Origins of ECT |
| etc-17 | 23 | 4 | 3 | 30 | God's Character |

Note: etc-01 was deleted (replaced by etc-01). Two E-items originating from the deleted etc-01 remain in the master file (subsequently incorporated into etc-01's scope).

## 2. Tier Strength Analysis

### 2.1 The Evidence Pyramid

The E/N/I methodology establishes a hierarchy of evidential weight:

1. **E-tier (Explicit Statements):** Direct quotes or close paraphrases of what the text actually says. Highest evidential weight. No interpretation required.
2. **N-tier (Necessary Implications):** Conclusions that follow unavoidably from E-items. Both sides of the debate would agree the text implies this.
3. **I-tier (Inferences):** Conclusions that require interpretive moves beyond what the text directly states. Subdivided by type:
   - **I-A:** Evidence-Extending -- systematizes E/N items without adding external concepts
   - **I-B:** Competing-Evidence -- both positions claim the same text; resolution requires weighing
   - **I-C:** Compatible-External -- adds concepts the text does not contain but does not directly contradict the text
   - **I-D:** Counter-Evidence-External -- requires overriding the lexical meaning of biblical words

### 2.2 Conditionalist Evidence by Tier

| Tier | Count | Percentage of Cond. items | Character |
|------|-------|--------------------------|-----------|
| E (Explicit) | 103 | 73.6% | Direct biblical statements |
| N (Necessary) | 13 | 9.3% | Unavoidable implications |
| I-A (Extending) | 24 | 17.1% | Systematizing E/N evidence |
| **Total** | **140** | **100%** | |

**Key observation:** 82.9% of conditionalist evidence is at the E or N tier -- direct textual statements and their unavoidable implications. The remaining 17.1% (I-A) systematizes textual evidence without introducing external frameworks.

No conditionalist item in the series is classified I-B, I-C, or I-D. The conditionalist case does not depend on any contested verse reading, any concept the text does not contain, or any redefinition of biblical vocabulary.

### 2.3 ECT Evidence by Tier

| Tier | Count | Percentage of ECT items | Character |
|------|-------|------------------------|-----------|
| E (Explicit) | 0 | 0.0% | No direct biblical statement supports ECT |
| N (Necessary) | 0 | 0.0% | No unavoidable implication supports ECT |
| I-B (Competing) | 23 | 40.4% | Contested verse readings |
| I-C (External) | 30 | 52.6% | Concepts the text does not contain |
| I-D (Counter) | 4 | 7.0% | Overriding biblical word meanings |
| **Total** | **57** | **100%** | |

**Key observation:** 100% of ECT evidence is at the inference level. No explicit biblical statement and no necessary implication in the entire 17-study series was classified as supporting ECT. The ECT case consists entirely of:
- 23 I-B items where both positions claim the same text (all resolved Strong toward conditionalist in prior studies -- meaning the plain-sense reading favors conditionalism while the ECT reading requires additional interpretive moves)
- 30 I-C items that add theological/philosophical concepts not found in any biblical text (e.g., the "sin against infinite God requires infinite punishment" Anselmian argument)
- 4 I-D items that require redefining biblical words from their lexical meaning (e.g., reading olethros "destruction" as "ongoing conscious ruin")

### 2.4 Comparative Tier Visualization

```
CONDITIONALIST EVIDENCE (140 items)
E-tier: ████████████████████████████████████████████████████ 103
N-tier: ███████ 13
I-A:    ████████████ 24

ECT EVIDENCE (57 items)
E-tier: (none)
N-tier: (none)
I-B:    ████████████ 23
I-C:    ███████████████ 30
I-D:    ██ 4
```

The structural asymmetry is stark: conditionalist evidence clusters at the top of the evidence pyramid (E/N/I-A), while ECT evidence exists exclusively at the bottom (I-B/I-C/I-D).

## 3. Cross-Study Pattern Analysis

### 3.1 Thematic Clusters

The 17 studies naturally fall into five thematic clusters:

**Cluster A: Foundational Anthropology (etc-01, 02, 03, 04)**
- What man IS, who has immortality, what death IS, the state of the dead
- Established: Man is mortal, formed from dust + breath; God alone has immortality; death reverses creation; the dead are unconscious
- Evidence character: Overwhelming E-tier, from didactic OT passages across multiple authors

**Cluster B: Destination Vocabulary (etc-05, 06)**
- The four "hell" words and the destruction vocabulary
- Established: No "hell" word inherently means eternal torment; the Bible's primary vocabulary for the wicked's fate is destruction/cessation; no lexicon defines these words as "torment"
- Evidence character: Lexical/semantic data, LXX translation patterns, systematic word usage analysis

**Cluster C: "Forever" Language (etc-07, 08)**
- Hebrew olam and Greek aionios -- do they inherently mean endless?
- Established: Duration determined by nature of subject; both words demonstrably describe finite realities; a separate Greek word (aidios) exists for "everduring"
- Evidence character: Cross-testament lexical analysis with dozens of verifiable test cases

**Cluster D: ECT Proof-Text Examination (etc-09 through 15)**
- Rich Man & Lazarus, Souls Under Altar, Smoke Ascending, Tormented Forever, Lake of Fire, Judgment Passages, ECT Strongest Case
- Established: Each passage, when examined at E/N/I tier, produces 0 ECT E-items; torment vocabulary (basanizo) is never applied to generic human wicked in didactic genre; the text distinguishes between non-human entities (torment formula) and humans (death/destruction formula)
- Evidence character: Genre analysis (parabolic, apocalyptic vs. didactic), vocabulary distribution, subject identification

**Cluster E: Contextual Studies (etc-16, 17)**
- Historical origins of ECT, God's character and justice
- Established: ECT entered Christianity through identifiable philosophical (Platonic) channels; God's self-revealed character and the biblical proportionality principle are consistent with destruction, not infinite torment
- Evidence character: Historical documentation (etc-16); didactic E-tier passages on divine character (etc-17)

### 3.2 Cross-Cluster Convergence

The five clusters converge on a single coherent picture from independent angles:

1. **Anthropology says:** Man is mortal; soul is not immortal; death is cessation
2. **Vocabulary says:** The Bible uses destruction/cessation words, not torment words, for the wicked's fate
3. **"Forever" words say:** Duration depends on the subject; olam/aionios do not inherently mean endless
4. **ECT proof-texts say:** When examined at E/N/I tier, each produces 0 ECT E-items; all ECT arguments are inferences
5. **Character/history say:** God's self-revealed character and justice are consistent with proportional destruction; ECT entered Christianity through Greek philosophy

The convergence of independent lines of evidence from independent study topics, using the same consistent methodology, constitutes a strong cumulative case.

### 3.3 Genre Distribution Finding

One of the most significant cross-study findings is the genre distribution of torment-language vs. destruction-language:

**Torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos) applied to final judgment:**
- Revelation (apocalyptic): Rev 14:10-11; 20:10 -- applied to beast-worshippers (symbolic context) and devil/beast/false prophet (non-human/symbolic entities)
- Parabolic: Luke 16:23-28 (different vocabulary: basanos/odunao rather than basanizo/basanismos)
- No epistle, no Gospel, and no OT passage applies basanizo or basanismos to the final fate of generic human wicked

**Destruction/death vocabulary applied to final judgment:**
- Epistles (didactic): Rom 6:23; 2 Thess 1:9; Phil 3:19; Gal 6:8; 2 Pet 2:12; 2 Pet 3:7,9; 1 Cor 15:18; Heb 10:27,39
- Gospels (teaching): Matt 10:28; 7:13; John 3:16; Luke 13:3,5
- OT (didactic/prophetic): Ps 37:10,20,38; 145:20; 92:7; Mal 4:1,3; Isa 1:28,31; Obad 1:16
- Revelation: Rev 20:9 (devoured), 20:14-15 (second death), 21:8 (second death)

**Significance:** Didactic genre (epistles, Torah, wisdom literature, prophets speaking as teachers) -- the genre most suited to doctrinal instruction -- consistently uses destruction/death language. Torment language for eschatological judgment appears only in apocalyptic vision and parabolic narrative -- genres where imagery requires careful interpretation and cannot be pressed into doctrinal propositions without passing genre-validation gates.

## 4. Key Contested Items (I-B Analysis)

The 23 I-B items represent passages where both conditionalist and ECT positions claim the same text. Each was resolved in the study where it appeared. Resolution method: compare the Plain vs. Ambiguous character of each side's reading.

### 4.1 Summary of I-B Resolutions

| I-ID | Passage | ECT Claim | Conditionalist Counter | Resolution |
|------|---------|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| I002 | 2 Cor 5:4,8; Phil 1:23 | Proves conscious intermediate state | These describe desire/hope, not doctrinal assertions about death-state | Strong: Conditionalist (didactic death-state passages are plain; Paul's desires are ambiguous about mechanism) |
| I003 | Luke 23:43 | Jesus promises thief consciousness in paradise that day | Greek has no punctuation; "today I say to you" is grammatically valid; Jesus was in tomb, not paradise | Strong: Conditionalist (punctuation is interpretive; John 20:17 is unambiguous) |
| I004 | Matt 22:32; Luke 20:38 | "God of the living" proves patriarchs are alive now | Jesus' argument is about resurrection, not intermediate state (context: Sadducees deny resurrection) | Strong: Conditionalist (context determines meaning; v.37 is about resurrection) |
| I005 | Rev 6:9-11 | Proves conscious souls after death | Apocalyptic vision with symbolic elements; follows Abel's-blood pattern | Strong: Conditionalist (genre gate fails) |
| I006 | Luke 16:19-31 | Proves conscious torment after death | Parabolic genre; ECT scholars identify as intermediate state, not final hell | Strong: Conditionalist (genre gate fails; ECT scholars concede it) |
| I007 | 1 Pet 3:18-20 | Christ preached to spirits in prison (conscious dead) | Interpretive options: preached through Noah; or proclaimed victory to fallen angels | Strong: Conditionalist (multiple viable readings; not didactic death-state passage) |
| I025 | Isa 14:9-10 | Shades "speak" in sheol, proving consciousness | Labeled mashal (taunt-poem, v.4); personification (trees "rejoice" v.8) | Strong: Conditionalist (genre: taunt-song/personification, not didactic) |
| I026 | Ezek 32:21,27 | Warriors "speak" in sheol | Prophetic lamentation; same warriors lie with swords under heads (sleep imagery) | Strong: Conditionalist (genre: lamentation; text contains sleep markers) |
| I027 | 1 Sam 28:15-19 | Samuel "speaks" from the dead, proving consciousness | Exceptional/miraculous event (God-initiated); not a normative death-state passage | Strong: Conditionalist (exceptional events cannot establish normative doctrine) |
| I038-I044 | Various | ECT readings of gehenna, Mark 9:48, "worm dieth not" | Gehenna uses apollumi not basanizo; Isa 66:24 source describes corpses (peger) | Strong: Conditionalist (source text unambiguously describes dead bodies) |
| I045-I057 | Various | Destruction vocabulary is metaphorical for "spiritual ruin" | No lexicon supports this definition; requires override of lexical meaning | Strong: Conditionalist (lexical meaning is plain; metaphorical reading is an addition) |
| I058-I066 | Various | Olam/aionios always mean endless in eschatological contexts | Demonstrable finite uses (Isa 34:10; Jude 1:7; Exo 21:6; 1 Sam 2:30) | Strong: Conditionalist (counter-examples are verifiable) |
| I071-I074 | Rev 14, 20, Matt 25, Dan 12 | ECT readings of key judgment texts | Each resolved on genre, subject, vocabulary grounds | Strong: Conditionalist (per studies etc-11 through etc-14) |

### 4.2 I-B Resolution Pattern

All 23 I-B items were resolved "Strong" toward conditionalist reading. The resolution pattern is consistent:
- **Conditionalist side** relies on: lexical meaning of words, genre identification, subject identification, didactic passages
- **ECT side** relies on: metaphorical extension of vocabulary, pressing apocalyptic/parabolic imagery as doctrine, same-adjective arguments (if "eternal life" is endless, "eternal punishment" must be endless), exceptional events as normative

The methodology's resolution framework (compare Plain vs. Ambiguous character) consistently identifies the conditionalist reading as "plain" (lexical, genre-appropriate, contextually supported) and the ECT reading as "ambiguous" (requiring additional interpretive frameworks, genre-crossing, or vocabulary redefinition).

## 5. "What CAN Be Said" -- E-Tier Supported Conclusions

These conclusions are supported by explicit biblical statements (E-tier) across multiple studies, authors, genres, and testaments.

### 5.1 Man is mortal; the soul is not inherently immortal
- **E-tier support:** Gen 2:7; 3:19,22; Ecc 3:19-20; Ps 104:29; 146:4; Job 4:17; Ezek 18:4,20; Matt 10:28
- **Studies:** etc-01, 02, 03
- **Author spread:** Moses, Solomon, Job, Ezekiel, Jesus
- **Genre:** Narrative, wisdom, prophecy, Gospel teaching
- **Both testaments:** Yes

### 5.2 God alone possesses immortality; immortality is His gift
- **E-tier support:** 1 Tim 6:16; Rom 2:7; 1 Cor 15:53-54; 2 Tim 1:10
- **Studies:** etc-01, 02
- **Author spread:** Paul
- **Genre:** Epistles (didactic)
- **Both testaments:** NT explicit; OT implied by Gen 3:22 (barring from tree of life)

### 5.3 Death reverses creation; the dead are unconscious
- **E-tier support:** Ecc 9:5,10; 12:7; Ps 6:5; 115:17; 146:4; Ps 88:10-12; Isa 38:18-19; Job 14:12,21; Job 3:17-18
- **Studies:** etc-01, 03, 04
- **Author spread:** Solomon, David, Isaiah, Job
- **Genre:** Wisdom, Psalms, narrative
- **Both testaments:** OT explicit; NT sleep-metaphor confirms (7+ authors)

### 5.4 The Bible's primary vocabulary for the wicked's fate is destruction/cessation, not torment
- **E-tier support:** ~60+ E-items across etc-05 and etc-06 documenting: abad/apollumi, shamad, kalah, shachath, apoleia, olethros -- used in Psalms, prophets, wisdom, epistles, Gospels
- **Studies:** etc-05, 06
- **Author spread:** David, Solomon, prophets, Jesus, Paul, Peter, John
- **Genre:** Wisdom, prophetic, epistolary, Gospel teaching
- **Both testaments:** Yes (LXX confirms cross-testament vocabulary continuity: abad -> apollumi 141x)

### 5.5 No "hell" word inherently means eternal torment
- **E-tier support:** Sheol/Hades = general abode of all dead (Gen 37:35; Ps 16:10; Acts 2:27,31); Gehenna = "destroy soul and body" (Matt 10:28); Tartaroo = temporary angel-prison (2 Pet 2:4)
- **Studies:** etc-05
- **Lexical support:** LXX translations, Strong's definitions, semantic range data

### 5.6 Olam and aionios do not inherently mean "endless"
- **E-tier support:** Olam applied to ended institutions (Aaronic priesthood, Mosaic ceremonies, Solomon's temple), human lifespan (Exo 21:6), three days (Jon 2:6); olam promises revoked (1 Sam 2:30; 13:13). Aionios used for past time (Rom 16:25; 2 Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2). Aidios (not aionios) used for "everduring" (Rom 1:20; Jude 1:6).
- **Studies:** etc-07, 08
- **Verifiable test cases:** 20+ instances where olam/aionios describe demonstrably finite realities

### 5.7 The stated penalty for sin is death
- **E-tier support:** Gen 2:17; Ezek 18:4,20; Rom 6:23; Gal 6:8
- **Studies:** etc-01, 02, 03, 17
- **Author spread:** Moses, Ezekiel, Paul
- **Genre:** Narrative, prophetic, epistolary
- **Both testaments:** Yes

### 5.8 The "tormented for ever and ever" formula applies to non-human/symbolic entities, not generic human wicked
- **E-tier support:** Rev 20:10 names devil, beast, false prophet. When humans enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8), the term is "second death." When human armies face fire (Rev 20:9), the text uses "devoured."
- **Studies:** etc-12, 13
- **Genre consideration:** All in apocalyptic Revelation (Tree 3 Gate 3 consideration)

### 5.9 Biblical punishment is proportional ("according to deeds")
- **E-tier support:** Rom 2:6; Job 34:11; Ps 62:12; Jer 17:10; Luke 12:47-48; Matt 10:15; 11:22; Heb 2:2; 10:29; Col 3:25
- **Studies:** etc-17
- **Author spread:** Paul, Job, David, Jeremiah, Jesus, author of Hebrews (11+ passages, 9+ authors)
- **Both testaments:** Yes

### 5.10 God's anger is explicitly described as temporary
- **E-tier support:** Ps 103:9 ("not always chide, neither keep anger for ever"); Mic 7:18 ("retaineth not anger for ever"); Isa 57:16 ("I will not contend for ever")
- **Studies:** etc-07, 17
- **Author spread:** David, Micah, Isaiah

---

## 6. "What CANNOT Be Said" -- Claims Not Supported by the Evidence

### 6.1 It CANNOT be said that any explicit biblical statement teaches eternal conscious torment of human beings
- **Basis:** 449 E-items were classified across 17 studies. Not a single E-item was classified ECT. Zero.
- **Significance:** The most fundamental claim of the ECT position -- that the Bible teaches the wicked will be tormented forever -- has no E-tier support in the entire evidence base.

### 6.2 It CANNOT be said that any necessary implication requires eternal conscious torment
- **Basis:** 65 N-items were classified. Not a single N-item was classified ECT. Zero.
- **Significance:** Even at the level of unavoidable logical implications from the text, ECT finds no support.

### 6.3 It CANNOT be said that basanizo or basanismos is applied to the final fate of generic human wicked in didactic genre
- **Basis:** All basanizo/basanismos judgment uses occur in Revelation's apocalyptic framework or Luke 16's parabolic context. No epistle, no Gospel teaching, and no OT passage uses torment vocabulary for the wicked's final fate.
- **Studies:** etc-12, 14, 15

### 6.4 It CANNOT be said that the "immortal soul" is a biblical concept
- **Basis:** The phrase "immortal soul" never appears in Scripture. Athanasia (3 NT occurrences) is never applied to the human psyche. The concept is traced to Plato (c. 360 BC).
- **Studies:** etc-01, 02, 16

### 6.5 It CANNOT be said that destruction vocabulary means "ongoing conscious ruin" without overriding lexical definitions
- **Basis:** No lexicon defines abad, shamad, kalah, shachath, apollumi, apoleia, or olethros as "torment" or "ongoing conscious suffering." Reading them as such requires I-D level redefinition.
- **Studies:** etc-06

### 6.6 It CANNOT be said that "sin against infinite God requires infinite punishment" is a biblical argument
- **Basis:** No verse contains this reasoning. No verse measures punishment by the dignity of the offended party. Every verse addressing the measure of punishment uses "according to deeds" (the offender's actions). This is an Anselmian philosophical framework (c. 1098 AD), classified I-C.
- **Studies:** etc-15, 17

### 6.7 It CANNOT be said that olam/aionios always mean "endless" when applied to punishment
- **Basis:** Dozens of verifiable counter-examples where olam describes finite realities. Aionios used for past ages. Aidios exists as a separate word for "everduring."
- **Studies:** etc-07, 08

### 6.8 It CANNOT be said that ECT was the earliest Christian position
- **Basis:** The Apostolic Fathers (c. 90-150 AD) taught conditional immortality. Natural soul immortality was introduced by former Platonist philosophers. ECT was formalized by Augustine (c. 430 AD). Conditional immortality was never condemned by any church council.
- **Studies:** etc-16

### 6.9 It CANNOT be said that infinite torment is consistent with the "according to deeds" principle
- **Basis:** 11+ passages across 9+ authors state punishment is proportional to deeds. Human deeds are finite. Infinite punishment for finite deeds contradicts explicit proportionality statements.
- **Studies:** etc-17

### 6.10 It CANNOT be said that God retains anger forever
- **Basis:** Two explicit passages state the opposite: Ps 103:9; Mic 7:18.
- **Studies:** etc-07, 17

---

## 7. The Structural Asymmetry

The most striking finding across all 17 studies is the structural asymmetry between the two positions:

### Conditionalist Position
- Built on: E-tier and N-tier evidence (116 of 140 items = 82.9%)
- Uses: Lexical meanings of biblical words
- Draws from: Didactic genre (epistles, wisdom literature, prophetic teaching, Gospel instruction)
- Spans: Both testaments, 9+ authors, multiple genres
- Requires: No redefinition of vocabulary, no external philosophical frameworks, no pressing of apocalyptic/parabolic imagery as doctrine

### ECT Position
- Built on: Inference only (57 of 57 items = 100%)
- Uses: Interpretive extensions, metaphorical readings of destruction vocabulary, same-adjective arguments, apocalyptic imagery pressed as doctrine
- Draws from: Primarily apocalyptic Revelation (the book with the most symbolic imagery in the NT)
- Requires: Redefining destruction vocabulary (I-D), adding Platonic soul immortality (I-C), the Anselmian "infinite God" argument (I-C), extending non-human/symbolic torment language to humans (I-C)

This asymmetry is not the result of investigative bias. The methodology was applied uniformly: every passage was examined by the same E/N/I classification trees, the same Tree 3 validation gates, the same genre rules. The asymmetry reflects what the texts actually say when read at the lexical level in their identified genres.
