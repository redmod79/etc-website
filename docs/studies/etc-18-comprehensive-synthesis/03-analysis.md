## The Central Question

The question is whether Scripture teaches that the wicked will experience eternal conscious torment (ECT) in the lake of fire, or whether the wicked will be destroyed — ceasing to exist — in what the text calls "the second death" (Conditionalism/Annihilationism). Both positions cite the same Scripture; this analysis examines what the text explicitly states, what it necessarily implies, and what remains at the level of inference.

## E-Tier Analysis

### E-Conditionalist Evidence (128 items)

The 128 Conditionalist E-items are organized below by theme. These are statements both ECT and Conditionalist readers must acknowledge as textual facts.

#### Category 1: Human Nature and Mortality (E-items primarily from etc5-01 and etc5-02)

The text states that man "became" (hayah, result-form) a living soul in Gen 2:7 — not that he received one. The identical formula applies to animals (Gen 1:24). The nephesh (soul) can die: "the soul that sinneth, it shall die" (Ezk 18:4 — E024). God can "destroy both soul and body in gehenna" (Mat 10:28 — E026). At death, "his thoughts perish" that very day (Psa 146:4 — E013). "The dead know not any thing" (Ecc 9:5 — E017). The dead do not praise God (Psa 115:17 — E014; Psa 6:5 — E015; Isa 38:18-19 — E022). "All are of the dust, and all turn to dust again" (Ecc 3:20 — E011).

On immortality: "God only [monos] hath immortality [athanasia]" (1 Tim 6:16 — E029). Humans "seek" immortality — it is a goal, not a present possession (Rom 2:7 — E030). "This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality" — future event at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53 — E031). The deathless state belongs to those who obtain the resurrection (Luk 20:35-36 — E082). Life is in the Son: "he that hath not the Son of God hath not life" (1 Jn 5:11-12 — E068).

**Key observations from this category:**
- Immortality vocabulary (athanasia, aphtharsia, aphthartos): zero NT occurrences apply to present human soul
- Mortality vocabulary (thnetos) applies to current human condition in all 6 NT occurrences
- The soul is explicitly stated to be destructible by God and mortal in its current state

#### Category 2: Death as the Wages of Sin

"The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom 6:23 — E072). "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish [apollumi], but have everlasting life" (Jhn 3:16 — E114). "They that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation" — death described as sleep throughout Scripture (E099; E023). "Everlasting destruction [olethron aionion] from the presence of the Lord" (2 Th 1:9 — E116). "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" (1 Cor 15:26 — E083). "These, as natural brute beasts... shall utterly perish in their own corruption" (2 Pet 2:12 — E117).

The second death receives two explicit textual identifications: Rev 20:14 ("THIS IS the second death" — E110) and Rev 21:8 ("which IS the second death" — E113). The name "second death" uses thanatos (G2288), the standard Greek word for death, not basanismos (torment).

#### Category 3: Destruction Vocabulary (~2,060+ occurrences across 15+ word families)

Hebrew destruction terms: H6 (abad) "perish" — Psa 37:20 (E151); H8045 (shamad) "be destroyed" — Psa 92:7 (E162); H3617 (kalah) "complete destruction"; H6789 (tsamath) "cut off utterly"; H5595 (saphah) "sweep away/consume."

Greek destruction terms: G622 (apollumi, 92 NT occurrences) — Jhn 3:16, Mat 10:28, Rom 2:12 (E275); G3639 (olethros, 4 NT occurrences) — 2 Th 1:9 (E116); G1311 (diaphtheirō) — Rev 11:18 (E276); G5356 (phthora) — 2 Pet 2:12.

Non-existence expressions: "they shall be as though they had not been" (Obad 1:16 — E158); "he was not" (Psa 37:36 — E155); "let the wicked be no more" (Psa 104:35 — E160); "never shalt thou be any more" (Ezk 28:19 — E176).

Physical destruction imagery: ashes (Mal 4:3 — E157); stubble burned up (Mal 4:1 — E156); smoke consumed (Psa 37:20 — E151); wax melting; chaff driven by wind. Every destruction image depicts cessation, not ongoing activity.

LXX bridge confirmed: H6 (abad) → G622 (apollumi): 141 occurrences, PMI 6.14 — the dominant correspondence establishing lexical continuity between Hebrew and Greek destruction vocabularies (E170).

Paul's consistent eschatological noun for the fate of the wicked: olethros (G3639) — he NEVER uses basanismos for this purpose (E210).

#### Category 4: God's Stated Will and Character

God does not take pleasure in the death of the wicked: "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked" (Ezk 18:23 — E106; Ezk 18:32 — E107). By the most solemn OT oath formula: "As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked" (Ezk 33:11 — E297). God is "not willing [ou boulomai] that any should perish [apollumi]" (2 Pet 3:9 — E302). "It is not the will of your Father... that one of these little ones should perish [apollumi]" (Mat 18:14 — E303).

God's wrath is non-perpetual: "He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy" (Mic 7:18 — E301). "I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth" (Isa 57:15-16 — E299). "He doth not afflict willingly [lo milib-bo — not from his heart]" (Lam 3:33 — E300). God endures "with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction [apoleia]" — the word for the outcome of his longsuffering is destruction, not torment (Rom 9:22 — E310).

Jesus teaches graduated punishment: "many stripes" vs. "few stripes" proportional to knowledge and responsibility (Luk 12:47-48 — E311).

#### Category 5: The Hell-Word Definitions

Gehenna passages (all 12 NT occurrences): torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos) is entirely absent; gehenna passages consistently use apollumi (E143). "Fear him which is able to destroy [apollumi] both soul and body in hell [gehenna]" (Mat 10:28 — E026).

Sheol and hades: both righteous and wicked go there; they are temporary (delivered up at judgment, then cast into the lake of fire — E134, N026). The soul in sheol "cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee" (Isa 38:18 — E022).

The Sodom paradigm: Jude 1:7 calls Sodom's destruction "the vengeance of eternal fire [puros aiōniou]" (E147); 2 Pet 2:6 describes the same event as "turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes [tephroō]" (E161). N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved after Study 5)*: "eternal fire" denotes permanent result, not ongoing burning process.

Second death: the lake of fire when applied to human wicked = "the second death" (thanatos — standard death word, not torment word): Rev 20:14 (E110); Rev 21:8 (E113). Overcomer exemption from the second death confirms it as a genuine death-outcome (E108, E109).

#### Category 6: Other E-Conditionalist Evidence

Blessed righteous dead "rest from their labours" (Rev 14:13 — E129). David dead and buried as of Pentecost — Christ's soul was in hades until resurrection (Acts 2:29, 2:31 — E130, E131). God blocks access to the tree of life to prevent man from living forever (Gen 3:22-24 — E003). Fire devours (esthiō) the adversaries at judgment (Heb 10:27 — E272; N046). Judgment vocabulary at Great White Throne is krinō (judicial verdict) not basanizō (E268; N043). Paul's summary word for the fate of sinners: apollumi (Rom 2:12 — E275; N044). The negative resurrection is named anastasim kriseōs (judgment/verdict), not anastasim basanismou (torment) (Jhn 5:29 — E270; N045).

### E-ECT Evidence (7 items)

The 7 ECT E-items are:

**E038 — 2 Cor 5:8:** Paul describes being "absent from the body" as being "present with the Lord." Intermediate state; righteous.

**E039 — Phil 1:23:** Paul expresses "a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better." Intermediate state; righteous.

**E050 — Luke 23:43:** Jesus says "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise." Intermediate state; righteous.

**E052 — Heb 12:23:** "The spirits of just men made perfect" are listed as present in the heavenly assembly. Intermediate state; righteous.

**E123 — Luke 16:23-25:** The rich man "being in torments" in hades calls out and Abraham confirms "thou art tormented." IB006 (Moderate toward parabolic) governs; even on a literal reading, N038 establishes the setting is pre-resurrection hades, not the final post-judgment state.

**E149 — Rev 20:10:** "The devil... shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever." Three named supernatural entities (devil, beast, false prophet) are the grammatical subjects.

**E150 — Rev 14:10-11:** Beast-worshippers (a specific tribulation-era class) "shall be tormented with fire and brimstone... the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever." IB009 (STRONG toward desolation-not-perpetual-torment) and IB008 (Moderate against universal extension) govern.

**What the 7 ECT E-items actually state:**
- E038, E039, E050, E052: Pertain to the intermediate state of the righteous — not the final fate of the wicked
- E123: Describes hades (temporary, pre-resurrection per N026), not the lake of fire or final post-judgment state
- E149: Applies the torment formula to three named supernatural/apocalyptic entities (two of which — beast and false prophet — are symbolic kingdom/power-system entities)
- E150: Applies torment language to a specific tribulation-era class; governed by IB009 STRONG (smoke formula = permanent desolation) and IB008 Moderate (against universal extension)

None of the 7 ECT E-items addresses the final fate of ALL human wicked using explicit torment vocabulary.

---

### E-Neutral Evidence (177 items — selective summary)

The 177 Neutral E-items are textual facts both sides must acknowledge. They include:

**Grammatical and lexical facts:** The same aionion adjective governs both outcomes in Mat 25:46 (E208); kapnos (smoke) is the grammatical subject of ascending in Rev 14:11 (E211); basanisthesontai applies to three named subjects in Rev 20:10 (E212); G929 (basanismos) has 6 NT occurrences, all in Revelation (E172); G622 (apollumi) has 92 NT occurrences throughout the canon (E181); the "no rest day and night" phrase appears identically in Rev 4:8 for the four living creatures' worship (E253).

**Genre and subject identifications:** Rev 1:1 uses esemainō (communicate through signs) — the book's self-described mode (E231); Death and Hades appear as horsemen in Rev 6:8 — explicit personification in same chapter as Rev 6:9-11 (E232); the altar speaks in Rev 16:7 (E233); Rev 19:20 states the beast and false prophet were cast alive (zontes) into the lake (E259).

**Statistical observations:** H5769 (olam) has 40+ distinct KJV renderings across 432 occurrences (E186); G166 (aionios) has 12 distinct KJV translations across 48 occurrences (E198); sheol is translated as hades 58/67 times in the LXX, PMI 33.87 (E138).

**Subject and setting identifications:** Dan 12:2 describes both outcomes under the same olam construction (E023); Mat 25:41 notes fire was prepared for the devil and his angels (E118, E214); Mat 25:46 identifies punishment and life with grammatically identical aionion forms (E119, E208); four distinct casting events in Rev 19:20-20:15 with distinct vocabulary for distinct subjects (E267).

## N-Tier Analysis (46 items)

### Conditionalist N-items (27 items)

The 27 Conditionalist N-items establish the following by necessary implication:

**On human nature:** Man has no inherent immortality; the whole living person IS the nephesh (N001). God alone currently possesses immortality as an inherent attribute (N005). Immortality is acquired at resurrection, not at death (N006). The soul/nephesh can die; it is not indestructible (N007). God has authority to destroy both soul and body (N008). Humans must seek immortality because they do not currently possess it (N012). All three NT immortality-positive words are never applied to any present human (N013). "Life in himself" is a divine attribute not shared with humans (N014). Man lacked inherent immortality even before the fall — this is why God blocked the tree (N015). No NT text applies immortality vocabulary to any present human soul, spirit, or body (N016). Eternal life is a gift from Christ, not an inherent property (N017). Death is the universal human appointment (N018). Death as "the last enemy" is currently an active power (N019).

**On death:** Death entered through Adam's sin (N020). The second death IS the lake of fire by explicit textual identification (N021). First-resurrection participants are exempt from the second death; all others face it (N022). The dead lack consciousness across multiple independent witnesses (N023). Job 14:13-15 frames death as unconscious waiting (N024). Between death and resurrection, the dead are "not living" per Revelation's own framework (N025). Hades is a temporary holding state (N026).

**On destruction vocabulary:** G622 (apollumi) and G684 (apoleia) are structurally placed as antitheses of zoe (life) throughout the NT (N030). The NT destruction vocabulary inherits its semantic freight from the LXX's established Hebrew-Greek vocabulary bridge (N031). The Hebrew and Greek destruction vocabularies form a unified field consistently describing cessation and ruin (N032).

**On judgment:** The martyrs' "living" in Rev 20:4 is explicitly called "the first resurrection" (N041). The abolition of Death in Rev 20:14 executes the goal of 1 Cor 15:26 and produces the "no more death" of Rev 21:4 (N042). Paul's summary word for the fate of sinners in Rom 2:12 is apollumi (N044).

### Neutral N-items (19 items)

The 19 Neutral N-items establish observable structural and lexical facts both sides must acknowledge:

Nephesh and ruach apply to animals as well as humans (N002). Tselem (image of God) is the one creation-vocabulary term applied exclusively to humans (N003). Sheol and hades are the same reality across testaments (N027). Gehenna and sheol/hades are distinct, describing different eschatological stages (N028). "Eternal fire" denotes permanent result, not ongoing burning process — as established by the Sodom paradigm (N029). NT writers adopted the LXX's established destruction vocabulary (N031). Basanizo and basanismos are lexically distinct from the destruction vocabulary — no NT text uses both for the same event applied to the same subject (N033). Duration of olam is contextually determined by the subject's nature, not by the word itself (N034 — established by Hab 3:6). NT aionios carries olam's semantic range including contextual determination (N035). Aionios cannot be inherently forward-pointing endless because it refers to past elapsed time in three NT passages (N036). Aionios is not an alpha-privative formation; aidios is the word for inherent endlessness (N037). Even on a literal reading, Luke 16 describes pre-resurrection hades, not the final post-judgment state (N038). In Revelation's genre, inanimate objects are depicted as speaking — this does not require consciousness (N039). Rev 6:9-11 and Rev 20:4-5 martyrs are the same group by shared vocabulary (N040). Evaluation at the Great White Throne uses works-criterion and judicial verb krinō — not basanizō (N043). The negative resurrection in Jhn 5:29 is named after krisis (judgment/verdict), not basanismos (torment) (N045). The fire in Heb 10:27 is described by esthiō (devour/consume), not basanizō (N046).

### ECT N-items: 0

Zero N-items across all 17 studies support the ECT position.

## I-Tier Analysis

### I-A Evidence (28 items)

All 28 I-A items systematize E/N evidence into broader doctrinal claims. They require only criterion #5 (systematizing) and optionally #4a (SIS with verified connection). None requires overriding any E/N statement.

**Conditionalist I-A items (25):**
- IA001-IA011: Anthropological inferences — psychosomatic unity, mortal soul, no inherent immortality, tree-of-life narrative, etc.
- IA012-IA014: Death/life ontological opposition; second death as actual death; death/life antithesis
- IA015: Spirit-commendation followed by sleep in same narrative (Acts 7:59-60)
- IA016-IA017: Four hell-words are distinct; Isa 66:24 corpses govern Mark 9 gehenna imagery
- IA018-IA022: Destruction vocabulary describes cessation; two vocabulary sets describe different outcomes; "everlasting destruction" = permanent result; OT olam punishment passages = permanent outcome; aionios is subject-dependent
- IA023-IA024: Great White Throne judgment vocabulary pattern; torment vocabulary absent from all 10 major judgment passages while destruction vocabulary pervades them
- IA026: Torment vocabulary confined to Revelation's apocalyptic genre; destruction vocabulary throughout didactic NT
- IA027: Graduated punishment principle (Luk 12:47-48) extended to eschatological punishment *(reclassified from I-A to I-C after Study 17)*
- IA028: God's non-desire for apollumi + non-perpetual wrath = coherent character portrait more consistent with annihilation

**Neutral I-A items (3):**
- IA004: Image of God (not nephesh/ruach) is the distinguishing feature between humans and animals
- IA006: Image of God = relational/functional representation
- IA025: Biblical judgment passages consistently describe forensic structure (evaluation → verdict → execution)

**ECT I-A items: 0**

### I-B Evidence (18 items — the contested terrain)

I-B items have genuine textual evidence on both sides. All 18 have been resolved using the 5-step SIS protocol.

**Complete I-B resolution table:**

| ID | Thesis | Resolution | Direction |
|----|--------|-----------|-----------|
| IB001 | Conscious intermediate state for righteous | Moderate | Against (conditionalist) |
| IB002 | "Under the sun" qualifier limits Ecc pessimism | Moderate | Against ECT implication |
| IB003 | Trichotomy (three-part substance) | Moderate | Against trichotomy |
| IB004 | Substance dualism vs. dichotomy | **UNRESOLVED** | Only unresolved item |
| IB005 | Life-force (ruach) reading vs. personal spirit | Moderate | Toward life-force |
| IB006 | Luke 16 genre (literal vs. parabolic) | Moderate | Toward parabolic |
| IB007 | Luke 20:38 resurrection-certainty reading | Moderate | Toward resurrection-certainty |
| IB008 | Universal torment extension (Rev 14:10-11 → all wicked) | Moderate | Against universal extension |
| IB009 | Smoke-for-ever formula (desolation vs. ongoing torment) | **STRONG** | Toward permanent desolation |
| IB010 | 2Th 1:9 apo prosopou (banishment vs. source) | Moderate | Against banishment |
| IB011 | Dan 12:2 symmetry (referent-nature reading) | Moderate | Toward referent-nature |
| IB012 | Mat 25:46 symmetry (kolasis = punishment not torment) | Moderate | Toward referent-nature |
| IB013 | Rev 6:9-11 (literal souls vs. personification) | **STRONG** | Toward personification |
| IB014 | "No rest day and night" (ongoing torment vs. judgment-process) | Moderate | Toward judgment-process |
| IB015 | Rev 20:10 for-ever formula on active torment verb | Moderate | Toward permanent/irrevocable |
| IB016 | Mat 25:41 fire for devil = same experience for humans? | Moderate | Against universal extension |
| IB017 | Jhn 5:29 krisis vocabulary (does krisis include torment?) | Moderate | Against torment-reading |
| IB018 | God's character (more consistent with which position?) | Moderate | Toward conditionalist |

**Strong resolutions (2):**

**IB009 (STRONG toward permanent desolation):** The within-book demonstration at Rev 19:3 is decisive. The grammatically identical formula (kapnos + anabainei + eis tous aionas ton aionon) is applied by the same author in the same book to Babylon — which Rev 18 describes as destroyed "in one hour" and "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21). This constitutes a #4a SIS connection (same author, same book, same formula, demonstrably completed destruction). The FOR-desolation side has Plain items (Rev 19:3 within-book demonstration, N029 eternal fire = ashes, E147 Sodom = ashes). The AGAINST side (E150 is Plain for stating the torment/smoke/no-rest language) becomes Ambiguous on the duration-mechanism question once the within-book demonstration is applied. Strong resolution criteria satisfied.

**IB013 (STRONG toward personification/blood-testimony):** Five #4a SIS connections from the same author/book or tool-verified cross-testament: (1) Rev 16:7 (altar speaks — inanimate object, same author/book); (2) Rev 6:8 (Death/Hades as horsemen — personification is the governing literary mode of the same vision sequence); (3) Gen 4:10 (dead Abel's blood cries — tool-verified top NT parallel for Rev 6:10, score 0.330); (4) Rev 20:4-5 (same group's "living" = first resurrection, same author/book); (5) Rev 14:13 (anapauō = Spirit's characterization of blessed dead, governing Rev 6:11's same word). FOR-literal side has one Contextually Clear item (visual depiction of activity) and one grammatical observation — no Plain items establishing literal consciousness. Strong criteria satisfied.

**Unresolved (1):**

**IB004 (UNRESOLVED):** The substance dualism vs. holistic dichotomy question. Both positions have textual evidence; the question involves how to read ontological claims from functional statements. This is the only item that ends the series without resolution.

### I-C Evidence (3 items)

**IC001:** The subjective-time framework for Phil 1:23 / 2 Cor 5:8 (instantaneous subjective experience vs. objectively continuous intermediate state). External philosophical framework; does not override any E/N statement.

**IC002:** Rev 14:11 / 14:13 parallel structure (no rest vs. rest from labours). Literary parallelism argument; does not override any E/N statement.

**IC003:** Peter's restricted use of tartaroo demonstrates non-endorsement of the broader Greek Tartaros cosmology. Requires external knowledge of Greek mythology; does not override any E/N statement.

All three I-C items favor the Conditionalist reading.

### I-D Evidence (3 items)

**ID001:** Humans possess an inherent immortal soul that survives death. Overrides E029/N005 (God alone has immortality), E031/N006 (immortality at resurrection), E024/N007 (soul can die), E026/N008 (God can destroy the soul). Requires redefining "only" (monos) in 1 Tim 6:16.

**ID002:** Ezk 18:4 ("the soul that sins shall die") refers only to physical death of the body, not the soul. Overrides E024 by restricting the death-predicate's subject despite nephesh being the explicit grammatical subject.

**ID003:** "God alone [monos] has immortality" describes preeminence, not exclusive possession. Overrides N005 by requiring monos (alone/only) to mean "preeminently" against its plain meaning. The same word monos in 1 Tim 6:15 ("only Potentate") functions exclusively; qualifying it differently in the adjacent verse requires textual justification the text does not provide.

All three I-D items support ECT-adjacent claims and override E/N statements.

---

## Cross-Study Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: The Mortality Foundation (etc5-01 through etc5-04)

Studies 1-4 established that humans lack inherent immortality by creation — the soul/nephesh is mortal, can die, and is not described as exempt from God's destructive power. God alone has athanasia. Immortality is sought for, put on, and obtained at resurrection. The intermediate dead are described in didactic passages as lacking consciousness, knowledge, praise, and communication.

This foundation affects every subsequent judgment passage. If humans lack inherent immortality, then:
- The wicked cannot self-sustain in torment through their own nature
- The outcome named "death" (second death) genuinely means death, not an alternative form of existence
- Every passage using resurrection vocabulary to describe the wicked's fate is consistent with death-as-cessation
- Passages that describe conscious post-mortem experience for specific subjects require specific textual grounding, not default assumption

The foundational studies established 155 items (88 + 39 + 13 + 13 from etc5-01 to etc5-04 minus overlaps). These include the core anthropology that governs reading of all subsequent passages.

### Pattern 2: The Vocabulary Divide (etc5-05, etc5-06, supported throughout)

Destruction vocabulary: ~2,060+ occurrences across 15+ Hebrew and Greek word families throughout both testaments (etc5-06). LXX bridge: H6 (abad) → G622 (apollumi), PMI 6.14 — the dominant, non-accidental correspondence (E170). G622 alone: 92 NT occurrences throughout the canon — Pauline epistles, Gospels, General Epistles.

Torment vocabulary: G928 (basanizō): 12 NT occurrences total; eschatological uses confined to Revelation. G929 (basanismos): 6 NT occurrences, ALL in Revelation (E172).

N033 establishes: the two vocabulary sets are lexically non-overlapping. Not one NT text uses both for the same event applied to the same subject.

The ratio is approximately 96:18 in eschatological contexts. The distribution is not random: destruction vocabulary pervades every NT genre (didactic epistles, Synoptic Gospels, General Epistles, prophetic/wisdom literature), while torment vocabulary is confined to Revelation's apocalyptic imagery.

IA024 establishes: torment vocabulary is absent from all 10 major judgment passages (Rev 20:12; Jhn 5:29; 2Th 1:9; Heb 10:27; Heb 6:2; Rom 2:8-9; Acts 24:15; Rev 11:18; Mat 12:36-37; 2Co 5:10). Destruction vocabulary is present in every judgment passage that uses specific outcome vocabulary.

This pattern is an observable, genre-spanning, two-testament statistical fact. IA026 classifies it as an evidence-extending inference (I-A).

### Pattern 3: The Didactic vs. Apocalyptic Genre Distribution

The series repeatedly identifies the same genre distribution:

**Apocalyptic imagery (Revelation):** Torment vocabulary appears here. The book's own self-description (Rev 1:1: esēmainō = communicate through signs) establishes its symbolic-visionary mode. Revelation contains explicit personification of non-conscious entities speaking (Rev 16:7: altar speaks), personified abstractions (Death and Hades as horsemen, Rev 6:8), and literary conventions borrowed from OT prophetic literature (blood crying for justice from Gen 4:10, smoke ascending from Isa 34:10).

**Didactic teaching (Pauline epistles, Synoptic Gospels, General Epistles):** Destruction vocabulary exclusively. Paul's consistent eschatological noun: olethros (never basanismos). Jesus in the Synoptics: apollumi (not basanizō) for the fate of the wicked outside of Revelation. The General Epistles: phthora, apoleia, olethros.

Standard hermeneutical principle (from the series-level methodology): plain didactic statements interpret ambiguous apocalyptic imagery. When didactic passages consistently use destruction vocabulary for the wicked's fate and apocalyptic passages use torment vocabulary for specific named entities, the plain passages govern the reading of the apocalyptic.

### Pattern 4: The "Forever" Resolution (etc5-07, etc5-08)

N034 (Hab 3:6 demonstration): olam in the same verse applies to mountains that are scattered (finite duration) and to God's ways that endure (infinite duration). The word's duration is determined by the subject's nature, not by the word itself.

N036 (aionios, past-time uses): aionios demonstrably refers to elapsed past ages in three NT passages by two different authors (Rom 16:25; 2 Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2). A word that can look backward cannot be defined as inherently "forward-pointing endless."

N037 (aionios morphology): aionios is a denominal adjective (aion + -ios = "pertaining to the age"), not an alpha-privative formation. Aidios (from aei = "always") is the word that carries inherent endlessness.

The aidios / aionios distinction is confirmed by two independent authors (Paul and Jude): Paul uses aidios for God's power (Rom 1:20) and aionios for punishment language in the same epistle; Jude uses aidios for the angels' ongoing confinement and aionios for Sodom's completed fire (= ashes per 2 Pet 2:6) in adjacent verses of the same letter.

Event-noun pattern (Hebrews): aionios modifies completed acts with permanent results — "eternal redemption" obtained once for all (ephapax, Heb 9:12), "eternal salvation" accomplished, "eternal judgment" as irrevocable verdict. The aionios quality = permanence of outcome, not duration of ongoing process.

Application: "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion, Mat 25:46) — the punishment word is kolasis (from kolazo = prune/curtail), not basanismos (torment). IB012 governs the duration inference (Moderate toward referent-nature). "Everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion, 2 Th 1:9) — Paul uses the destruction word with the permanent-result adjective; the result IS destruction. "Eternal fire" (pyr aiōnion, Mat 25:41) — N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved)* governs via the Sodom paradigm (eternal fire = ashes).

### Pattern 5: The ECT Proof-Text Pattern (etc5-09 through etc5-12)

The four major claimed ECT proof-texts were examined in dedicated studies. Each resolved as I-B (competing evidence), not E or N for the ECT claim:

**Rich Man and Lazarus (IB006: Moderate toward parabolic):** Even on a literal reading, N038 establishes the setting is hades (temporary, pre-resurrection per N026), not the lake of fire. The passage cannot establish ECT as the final post-judgment state. The parabolic reading is supported by multiple Plain SIS connections (Luk 12:16 explicit parabolē label for same formula; Luk 15:3 discourse-level labeling practice; the passage's own stated purpose in vv.29-31). NOT STRONG: naming of Lazarus (E220) is a genuine anomaly preventing Strong resolution.

**Souls Under the Altar (IB013: STRONG toward personification):** The strongest I-B resolution in the entire series. Within-book SIS connections from same author/book prevent the literal-conscious-spirits reading: the altar speaks (Rev 16:7), Death/Hades are horsemen (Rev 6:8), the blood-crying-for-justice convention (Gen 4:10, tool-verified top parallel), and the martyrs' "living" = first resurrection (Rev 20:4-5). E051 reclassified from ECT to Neutral.

**Smoke Ascending Forever (IB009: STRONG toward desolation):** The within-book structural parallel (Rev 19:3, same author, same formula, same book, for Babylon which is "found no more at all") demonstrates that the formula describes permanent aftermath of completed destruction, not ongoing burning. Isa 34:10 is the tool-confirmed #1 OT parallel (PMI 9.95 for the smoke vocabulary bridge).

**Tormented Forever (IB015: Moderate toward permanent/irrevocable):** The torment formula in Rev 20:10 applies to exactly three named supernatural entities: devil, beast, false prophet. The beast is a symbolic kingdom-entity (Rev 17:8,11); the false prophet is a symbolic power-system. Rev 20:15 casts the human wicked into the same lake without repeating the torment formula. IB009's within-book demonstration prevents Strong ECT resolution; the direct-verb application prevents Strong Conditionalist resolution.

**Pattern from all four proof-texts:** Every major claimed ECT proof-text, when examined in its literary and canonical context, either addresses a specific limited subject class, describes a pre-final state (hades), or uses imagery whose within-book/within-canon parallels demonstrate the language describes permanent outcome rather than perpetual conscious process.

### Pattern 6: The Three-Vocabulary Pattern of Rev 20:9-15 (etc5-11, 12, 13, 14, 15)

Rev 20:9-15 applies three distinct vocabulary sets to three distinct subject groups:

1. **Rev 20:9 — Human armies:** "fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured [katephagen] them." Consumption/devouring vocabulary. No torment formula.

2. **Rev 20:10 — Three named supernatural/symbolic entities (devil, beast, false prophet):** "tormented day and night for ever and ever [basanisthesontai... eis tous aionas ton aionon]." Explicit torment formula. IB015 governs.

3. **Rev 20:14-15 — Human wicked ("whosoever was not found written in the book of life"):** "cast into the lake of fire" = "the second death." The torment formula is NOT repeated. The lake of fire when applied to human wicked receives the name "second death" (thanatos — standard death word).

This three-vocabulary pattern, identified consistently across five studies (etc5-11, 12, 13, 14, 15), is a textual observation both sides must acknowledge as a factual description of what the passage says. N043-N046 establish the judgment vocabulary (krinō, krisis, esthiō) in the surrounding context. The systematic vocabulary differentiation within the same passage by the same author for subjects standing in the same location is an observable literary fact.

### Pattern 7: The Zero-N-Tier Finding (etc5-15)

Study 15 examined the 8 strongest ECT arguments in a systematic steel-man exercise. The finding: zero ECT arguments reach the N (Necessary Implication) tier for the universal claim that ALL human wicked experience ongoing conscious torment FOREVER.

Every ECT argument requires at least one inference step:
- Interpreting the duration mechanism of the for-ever formula (IB009 governs)
- Inferring same-location = same-experience from different subjects (IB008, IB016)
- Extending from named specific supernatural subjects to all human wicked (IB008, IB015)
- Reading conscious-torment content into judgment vocabulary that does not contain it (IB017)
- Reading the genre of a narrative passage as literal eschatology (IB006)

By contrast, the conditionalist position generates 27 N-items (directly from E-tier statements without adding external concepts) and 25 I-A items (systematizing E/N evidence without overriding any E/N statement).

The contrast between zero ECT N-items and 27 Conditionalist N-items is a structural feature of the evidence base that both sides must acknowledge.

### Pattern 8: The I-B Resolution Direction

All 18 I-B items have been resolved:

- 2 Strong: both in the Conditionalist direction (IB009: desolation; IB013: personification)
- 15 Moderate: all either in the Conditionalist direction or against ECT claims (IB001, IB002, IB003, IB005, IB006, IB007, IB008, IB010, IB011, IB012, IB014, IB015, IB016, IB017, IB018)
- 1 Unresolved: IB004 (substance dualism vs. holistic dichotomy)

The IB items that pertain to ECT-direction claims all resolved AGAINST the ECT reading: IB006 (Luke 16 literal reading: Moderate against), IB008 (universal torment extension: Moderate against), IB009 (smoke formula: STRONG against perpetual-torment reading), IB013 (Rev 6:9-11 conscious spirits: STRONG against), IB014 (no-rest phrase: Moderate toward judgment-process), IB015 (Rev 20:10 torment formula: Moderate toward permanent/irrevocable, not Strong ECT), IB016 (Mat 25:41 universal extension: Moderate against), IB017 (krisis = torment content: Moderate against).

No I-B item resolved toward ECT. IB004 (the one unresolved item) pertains to ontological questions about human substance composition, not directly to the question of ongoing conscious post-mortem torment vs. destruction.

### Pattern 9: The Sodom Paradigm (etc5-05, 06, 11, 13, 15)

Scripture's own designated example of "eternal fire" is Sodom (Jude 1:7: "suffering the vengeance of eternal fire [puros aiōniou]"). The same author in the same letter-tradition describes the same event: "turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes [tephroō]" (2 Pet 2:6). "The LORD destroyed them" — Jesus confirms "the flood came, and destroyed them all" and "the fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all" (Luk 17:27-29).

N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved after Study 5)* establishes: "eternal fire" denotes a fire whose result is permanent and irrevocable — not a fire that continues burning forever. This is demonstrated by the Bible's own cross-reference, not by an external framework.

This paradigm appeared in five separate studies without being artificially forced. When Scripture uses the same language (eternal fire) for Sodom and for the fate of the wicked, and Scripture itself defines what Sodom's eternal fire produced (ashes, complete destruction), the definition governs subsequent uses of the same language.

### Pattern 10: The New Creation (etc5-11, 13, 15, 17)

Rev 21:4: "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."

N042: The abolition of Death (personified, Rev 20:14) is the narrative execution of 1 Cor 15:26 ("the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death"), producing the "no more death" of Rev 21:4. All three passages use thanatos (G2288) — the standard death word.

Rev 21:8 (four verses later in the same literary unit): "the fearful, and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." The same word thanatos appears in both verses: no death for the redeemed (Rev 21:4); second death for the wicked (Rev 21:8).

The new creation picture and the wicked's fate are stated in four consecutive verses by the same author using the same vocabulary. Death is abolished (N042). The wicked receive the second death (= the lake of fire, N021). If the wicked were in perpetual conscious torment, death would not be abolished — there would remain ongoing dying-without-dying. The conditionalist reading (second death = actual death/cessation) is consistent with the "no more death" promise; the ECT reading creates tension with it (though ECT proponents argue the two "deaths" differ in kind).

### Pattern 11: The Character Argument (etc5-17, interacting with etc5-06, 14)

IB018 resolved Moderate toward conditionalist direction. Nine Plain or Contextually Clear character statements (Ezk 33:11, 18:23, 18:32, 2 Pet 3:9, Mat 18:14, Lam 3:33, Mic 7:18, Hos 11:8-9, Isa 57:15-16) establish that God does not will the apollumi of any and does not retain perpetual anger. The vocabulary throughout is apollumi/death (destruction vocabulary), not basanismos (torment vocabulary).

The character evidence at I-B tier is consistent with and corroborated by the vocabulary evidence at E/N tier. The destruction vocabulary that pervades the explicit statements (Pattern 2) is the same vocabulary that appears in the character statements God does not desire ("not willing that any should perish [apollumi]"). IA028 systematizes this as a coherent portrait.

## What the Evidence Establishes vs. What It Does Not

### Established (E-tier or N-tier — both sides must acknowledge):

**On human nature:**
- Humans are mortal by creation; immortality is God's exclusive attribute until resurrection
- The soul/nephesh can die; God can destroy both soul and body
- The dead lack consciousness, knowledge, praise, and participation — stated by multiple independent authors across both testaments
- Immortality is future, at resurrection, not currently possessed

**On the vocabulary of judgment:**
- The dominant vocabulary for the fate of the wicked throughout both testaments (2,060+ occurrences) is destruction vocabulary — cessation and ruin
- Torment vocabulary is confined to Revelation's apocalyptic genre (18 NT occurrences)
- The two vocabulary sets are lexically non-overlapping; no NT text uses both for the same judgment on the same subject
- Paul's summary word for the fate of sinners is apollumi; his eschatological noun is olethros — never basanismos
- The negative resurrection in Jhn 5:29 is named anastasim kriseōs (verdict), not anastasim basanismou (torment)

**On the second death:**
- The second death IS the lake of fire — by explicit textual identification twice (Rev 20:14; 21:8)
- The name uses thanatos (standard death word), not basanismos (torment)
- Overcomer exemption from the second death confirms it as a genuine death-outcome

**On "forever" language:**
- Olam and aionios are subject-determined adjectives; their duration adapts to the referent's nature
- Aidios (inherent endlessness) is not used for punishment language; it is used for God's power and the angels' ongoing confinement
- "Eternal fire" on Sodom produced ashes — the Bible's own designated example

**On the torment passages specifically:**
- The torment formula in Rev 20:10 applies to three named supernatural/symbolic entities
- Rev 20:15 casts the human wicked into the lake without repeating the torment formula
- The smoke-ascending formula in Rev 19:3 is applied to Babylon (which is "found no more at all") by the same author in the same book
- IB009 resolves STRONG: the formula describes permanent aftermath of completed destruction

### Not established at the biblical-proof level:

**For ECT:**
- Any explicit statement that ALL human wicked experience ongoing conscious torment forever
- Any N-tier item supporting the universal claim about human wicked
- Extension of the Rev 20:10 torment formula to all persons in the lake of fire
- That "second death" means ongoing-conscious-torment rather than actual death
- That the Rich Man and Lazarus narrative describes the final post-judgment state

**For Conditionalism:**
- The complete cessation of all subjective experience at the moment of death (IB001 Moderate AGAINST conscious intermediate state — but unresolved for the righteous)
- That IB004 (substance dualism) resolves — it remains the only unresolved I-B item
- That the torment formula in Rev 20:10 for the three supernatural entities describes a non-conscious state
