- 1 Cor 5:5 — "destruction of the flesh"
- 1 Tim 6:9 — "destruction and perdition [olethron kai apoleia]"
**Note:** This is Paul's CONSISTENT eschatological noun for the fate of the wicked — he NEVER uses basanismos (torment) for this purpose (E210)
**Classification:** Conditionalist

---

### G5351 (phtheirō) and G1311 (diaphtheirō) — To Destroy, Ruin, Corrupt

**Parallel:** Rev 20:9 — "fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured [katephagen — G2719, Aor Act Ind] them" (E180)
**Note:** Same semantic register as consumption/devouring — NOT torment
**Classification:** Neutral/Conditionalist (N046 established: consumption vocabulary confirmed)

---

### Non-Existence Expressions

**H5 (abad) + G622 (apollumi):** Both carry the semantic freight of cessation
**Specific non-existence expressions (E154 from Obad 1:16):** "they shall be as though they had not been" — beyond mere ruin to non-existence affirmation
**Psa 37 cluster:** "they shall not be," "cut off," "shall be as the fat of lambs — consume into smoke"
**H7657 (epher) = ashes:** Mal 4:3 — "they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet" (E153)
**H7179 (qash) = stubble:** Mal 4:1 — "they shall be stubble, the day shall burn them up" (E152)
**Imagery pattern:** Chaff burned (wind disperses), wax melting, smoke dissipating, ashes remaining — ALL depicting cessation, not ongoing torment

---

## Section 2: Torment Vocabulary

*From etc5-05 (Four Hell Words), etc5-11 (Smoke Ascending Forever), etc5-12 (Tormented Forever)*

### Overview

~18 NT total occurrences of torment vocabulary (G928 + G929 combined). ALL eschatological uses are in Revelation. ZERO torment vocabulary appears in any gehenna passage. ZERO torment vocabulary appears in any Pauline epistle in an eschatological judgment context. **N033: Basanizō/basanismos and destruction vocabulary are lexically non-overlapping — not one NT text uses both for the same subject in the same judgment description.**

---

### G928 (basanizō) — To Torment, Torture

**BLB Definition:** to torture; to vex; to torment; to inflict painful labor
**Total NT occurrences:** 12
**Eschatological distribution:** ONLY in Revelation (eschatological uses)
**Eschatological uses:**
- Rev 14:10 — beast-worshippers "shall be tormented [basanizō]" (E150, ECT E-item)
- Rev 20:10 — devil, beast, false prophet "shall be tormented [basanisthēsontai — Fut Pass Ind 3P]" (E149, ECT E-item)
**Non-eschatological uses include:** Mat 8:6 (sick servant); Mat 8:29 (demons, "before the time"); Rev 9:5 (five-month bounded torment)
**Demons' statement (E226):** Mat 8:29 — "Art thou come hither to torment us BEFORE THE TIME [pro tou kairou]?" — demons explicitly acknowledge their permanent torment is FUTURE, not present
**Classification:** ECT (in eschatological uses for named subjects); Neutral (as vocabulary data)

---

### G929 (basanismos) — Torment (Noun)

**BLB Definition:** torment, severe pain; the noun form of basanizō
**Total NT occurrences:** 6
**Distribution:** ALL 6 in Revelation only
| Reference | Context | Classification |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Rev 9:5 | Scorpion-sting torment; explicitly **five months** | Bounded — explicitly time-limited |
| Rev 14:11 | Smoke "of their torment [basanismou]" ascending for ever | ECT E-item (E150); IB009 governs formula |
| Rev 18:7 | Babylon: "give her torment and sorrow" | Completed "in one hour" (E252) |
| Rev 18:10 | Babylon: "for in one hour is thy judgment come" | Completed destruction |
| Rev 18:15 | Babylon: "stand afar off for fear of her torment" | Completed judgment event |
| Rev 20:10 | Devil/beast/false prophet "tormented" for ever | ECT E-item (E149); IB015 governs |

**Key observation:** G929 (basanismos) NEVER appears in: any Pauline epistle's eschatological teaching, any General Epistle's eschatological teaching, any Synoptic Gospel's systematic teaching on the fate of the wicked, any of the 12 gehenna passages
**E172 established:** G929 basanismos — ALL 6 NT occurrences in Revelation only
**Classification:** Neutral (as vocabulary data); ECT (for specific eschatological uses in Revelation)

---

### Distribution Comparison

| Vocabulary Set | Total NT Occurrences | Eschatological Uses in Revelation | Eschatological Uses in Didactic NT |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| G928 basanizō (torment, verb) | 12 | ALL eschatological uses | ZERO |
| G929 basanismos (torment, noun) | 6 | ALL 6 | ZERO |
| G622 apollumi (destroy/perish) | 92 | Several | Many (Pauline epistles, Gospels) |
| G3639 olethros (destruction) | 4 | 1 (2Th 1:9) | 3 (all Paul) |

**IA026 established:** The torment vocabulary is confined entirely to Revelation's apocalyptic context and absent from every Pauline epistle, every General Epistle, and every Synoptic Gospel that systematically teaches about the fate of the wicked. This is a genre-distribution pattern.

---

### Torment Vocabulary Absent from These Judgment Passages

*(From etc5-14 — N033 extended across all 10 major judgment passages)*

## Section 3: Forever Words

*From etc5-07 (Olam/Forever in OT), etc5-08 (Aionios in NT)*

### H5769 (olam) — Time Out of Mind; The Vanishing Point

**BDB Definition:** "properly, concealed, i.e. the vanishing point; generally, time out of mind (past or future)"
**Strong's H5769:** "properly, a concealed point, i.e. the vanishing point; time out of mind (past or future)"
**Total OT occurrences:** 432 (across approximately 400 verses)
**KJV rendering distribution:** 40+ distinct English words including:
- "for ever" (most common)
- "everlasting"
- "old" / "of old"
- "ancient"
- "world" (Ecc 3:11)
- "long" (Ecc 12:5)
- "alway" / "always"
- "perpetual"
**Semantic core:** Temporal horizon-pointing — "the furthest extent from which a thing is visible or to which it extends"; NOT inherently infinite
**N034 established:** The duration olam denotes is determined by the nature and context of the subject — not by the word itself (demonstrated by Hab 3:6: same verse, olam for scattered mountains AND olam for God's enduring ways)

**Categories of olam use:**

**Category A — Bounded by mortality or explicit "until":**
- Exo 21:6 — slave serves "for ever" (le-olam) = bounded by mortality (E187)
- Jon 2:6 — Jonah "for ever" in fish belly = 72 hours (E189)
- Isa 32:14-15 — desolation "for ever" + explicit "Until the spirit be poured upon us" (E190)
- 1 Sam 2:30 — olam promise revoked in same verse (E188)
- Jer 51:39,57 — "perpetual sleep / shall not wake" (E132, E194)

**Category B — Contextually permanent but referent is destructible:**
- Isa 34:10 — "smoke thereof shall go up for ever" (then animals dwell in desolate land, vv.11-17) (E182, E192)
- Psa 92:7 — "destroyed for ever [ad-olam]" using shamad + abad (E162)
- Dan 12:2 — "everlasting contempt [dir'on olam]" parallel to "everlasting life [chayyei olam]" (E023)

**Category C — Genuinely endless (when referent is God or eternal entities):**
- Psa 90:2 — "from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God"
- Isa 57:15 — "the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity [ad]"
- Hab 3:6 — "halichot olam" (God's ways are everlasting) — same verse as scattered hills

**LXX Bridge (E195):**
- H5769 → G165 (aion): 287 times, **PMI 5.55** (very strong, non-accidental)
- H5769 → G166 (aionios): 100 times, **PMI 5.67** (slightly stronger; adjective form)
*N035 established: NT aionios carries the same semantic range as OT olam*

---

### G165 (aion) — Age, Era; The noun

**BLB Definition:** age; a long space of time; an era; the universe (by extension); this present era; a future era
**Total NT occurrences:** 128 (per BLB)
**Key eschatological uses:**
- "eis tous aionas ton aionon" = "into the ages of the ages" = "for ever and ever"
- Mat 13:39,40,49; 24:3; 28:20 — "synteleia tou aionos" = "the end of the age" (E217) — the aion HAS an end
- Mrk 10:30 — same verse contains both aioni (G165 noun) and zoen aionion (G166 adjective) — derivational relationship transparent (E218)

**"For ever and ever" formula (eis tous aionas ton aionon) — G165 distribution in Revelation (E256):**
- Applied to God, Christ, the redeemed: ~11 occurrences (inherently endless referents)
- Applied in judgment contexts: 3 occurrences
  - Rev 14:11 — smoke of beast-worshippers' torment (IB009 STRONG: permanent desolation)
  - Rev 19:3 — Babylon's smoke (same formula; Babylon "found no more at all") (E250)
  - Rev 20:10 — devil/beast/false prophet tormented (IB015 Moderate)

---

### G166 (aionios) — Pertaining to the Age; Age-Long; Eternal

**BLB Definition:** "perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well)" — the definition itself explicitly acknowledges bidirectionality (E197)
**Derivation:** Denominal adjective: aion + -ios suffix = "pertaining to the age" (NOT an alpha-privative formation)
**Total NT occurrences:** 71 (per BLB); 48 KJV occurrences
**KJV translation variants:** 12 distinct English expressions including "since the world began" (Rom 16:25), "for ever" (Phm 1:15), "eternal," "everlasting"

**N036 established:** Aionios cannot be inherently forward-pointing endless — it demonstrably refers to past elapsed time in three NT passages by two different authors:
- Rom 16:25 — "kept secret since the world began [chronois aioniois]" (E204)
- 2 Tim 1:9 — "before the world began [pro chronon aionion]" (E205)
- Tit 1:2 — same verse: forward-looking eternal life AND backward-looking past ages (E203)

**N037 established:** Aionios (denominal adjective) is NOT an alpha-privative formation and therefore does not inherently assert infinite, unending duration. The word for inherent endlessness is aidios (G126).

**Event-noun pattern in Hebrews (E207):**
- Heb 9:12 — "eternal redemption [aionion lutrosin]" obtained ONCE FOR ALL (ephapax = completed act); the aionios quality = permanence of result, not duration of ongoing process
- Heb 5:9 — "eternal salvation [aionion sōtērian]" — accomplished by Christ's obedience; act complete
- Heb 6:2 — "eternal judgment [aioniou krimatos]" — verdict rendered once; aionios = irrevocability

**Key judgment uses:**
- Mat 25:46 — "kolasin aionion" (penal infliction + age-long/permanent) vs. "zoen aionion" (life + eternal) — both A-ASF (E208); IB012 governs
- 2 Th 1:9 — "olethron aionion" (destruction + permanent/age-long) — aionios describes the permanent character of the destruction result (E116)
- Mat 25:41 — "pyr aiōnion" (fire + eternal/permanent) — N029 governs: eternal fire on Sodom = ashes

---

### G126 (aidios) — Inherently Everlasting

**BLB Definition:** "everduring (forward and backward, or forward)" — from G104 (aei = "always/continually") — adverb of unbroken, uninterrupted duration
**Derivation:** From G104 (aei = always, continually); the root carries INHERENT endlessness — not subject to the contextual determination that governs olam/aionios
**Total NT occurrences:** 2 only

| Occurrence | Context | Subject | Classification |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Rom 1:20 | God's "eternal [aidios] power and Godhead" | God's divine nature | Neutral |
| Jude 1:6 | Angels' "everlasting [aidios] chains" | Ongoing active confinement of fallen angels | Neutral |

**Key observation (E201, E202):**
- Paul used AIDIOS for God's intrinsic, inherently endless power (Rom 1:20)
- Paul used AIONIOS for eternal life throughout the same epistle (Rom 2:7; 5:21; 6:22,23)
- Jude uses AIDIOS for the angels' ONGOING confinement (still in chains) and AIONIOS for Sodom's COMPLETED fire (= ashes per 2 Pet 2:6)
- Two different authors, in two different letters, distinguish these two Greek words

**Implication:** When NT writers wanted to express inherent endlessness, they used aidios. When Paul describes the fate of the wicked in didactic teaching (2Th 1:9: olethron aionion), he used aionios — not aidios.

---

### H5703 (ad) — Perpetual, Everlasting

**BDB:** "perpetual, everlasting, to eternity"; appears in Hab 3:6 alongside olam for the mountains ("harre-ad" = mountains of ad); also in Isa 57:15 — "One that inhabiteth eternity [ad]"; used in ad-olam and le-ad compounds
**Semantic range:** Like olam, contextually determined — same verse as the scattered mountains in Hab 3:6

---

### H5331 (netsach) — Perpetually, Forever

**BDB:** "perpetually, forever"; related to "brightness" or "eminence"
**Key uses:**
- Isa 34:10 — "le-netsach netsachim" (the le-netsach netsachim compound in that verse) — intensified formula for Edom's permanent desolation
- Lam 3:18 — "my strength and my hope is perished from the LORD" — netsach in context of loss/cessation
- Isa 57:16 — "for I will not contend for ever [le-netsach]" (same passage as E299)

---

### Aramaic H5957 (alam) — Age-Long (Aramaic)

**BDB Aramaic:** similar to H5769 olam; "everlasting, forever"
**Key uses:** "O king, live for ever [le-alam]" — Dan 2:4; 3:9; 5:10; 6:21 (E196)
**Observation:** This court formula is addressed to mortal kings (Nebuchadnezzar, Darius) — demonstrating that even the Aramaic alam could function as a conventional expression, not a metaphysical absolute

---

## Section 4: Death and Immortality Words

*From etc5-01 (What Is Man), etc5-02 (Who Has Immortality), etc5-03 (Biblical Death)*

### H5315 / G5590 (nephesh/psyche) — Soul/Life/Person

**H5315 (nephesh):**
**BDB Definition:** soul, self, life, creature, person, appetite, mind, living being, desire, emotion, passion
**Total OT occurrences:** ~755
**Key observations:**
- Man BECAME a nephesh (Gen 2:7) — not received one; same formula for animals (Gen 1:24)
- Nephesh can refer to a CORPSE (Num 6:6; Lev 21:11 — "dead body")
- Nephesh can DIE — Ezk 18:4 ("the soul that sinneth, it shall die"); Num 23:10 ("Let my soul die the death of the righteous")
- God can DESTROY the nephesh — Mat 10:28 (parallel to psyche in Greek)

**G5590 (psyche) in Revelation distribution (E051 context):**
- Rev 8:9; 16:3 — biological life of sea creatures
- Rev 12:11 — physical life given up in martyrdom
- Rev 18:13 — persons as commercial commodities
- Rev 18:14 — appetite/desire
- Rev 6:9; 20:4 — souls of martyred persons (in visionary context)
*In NO Revelation occurrence does psyche unambiguously mean "conscious disembodied spirit"*

---

### G110 (athanasia) — Immortality, Deathlessness

**BLB Definition:** immortality, deathlessness; from G1 (a-privative = "not") + G2348 (thaneō = to die); inherent deathlessness
**Total NT occurrences:** 3

| Occurrence | Applied to | Context | Classification |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 1 Cor 15:53 | "this mortal must put on immortality" | Future resurrection event | Conditionalist |
| 1 Cor 15:54 | "when this mortal shall have put on immortality" | Future resurrection event | Conditionalist |
| 1 Tim 6:16 | God "who only hath immortality" | Present divine attribute | Conditionalist |

**Zero occurrences** apply athanasia to a present human soul as a currently possessed attribute.
**N013 established:** All 3 NT athanasia occurrences apply either to God alone or to the future resurrection state.

---

### G861 (aphtharsia) — Incorruption, Imperishability

**BLB Definition:** incorruptibility; from G1 (a-privative) + G5351 (phtheirō = to corrupt, destroy); state of being incorruptible/imperishable
**Total NT occurrences:** 9
**Distribution:** Sought for (Rom 2:7); put on at resurrection (1 Cor 15:42,50,53,54); in God's nature; never applied to a present human soul as currently possessed
**Classification:** Conditionalist (as vocabulary data)

---

### G862 (aphthartos) — Incorruptible, Imperishable (Adjective)

**BLB Definition:** incorruptible, imperishable
**Total NT occurrences:** 8
**Key use:** 1 Tim 6:16 — used for God alongside athanasia; never applied to the present human soul
**Classification:** Neutral (as vocabulary data)

---

### G2288 (thanatos) — Death (Standard Greek Word)

**BLB Definition:** death; the separation of soul from body; the death of the body
**Total NT occurrences:** 120
**Key eschatological significance:**
- 1 Cor 15:26 — "The last enemy that shall be destroyed [katargeō] is death [thanatos]" (E083)
- Rev 20:14 — "This IS the second death [thanatos]" (E110) — the second death USES the standard death word
- Rev 21:4 — "there shall be no more death [thanatos]" — result of abolition of death in Rev 20:14 (E112)
- Rev 21:8 — "which IS the second death [ho thanatos ho deuteros]" (E113)
**N042 established:** The abolition of Death (Rev 20:14) = fulfillment of 1 Cor 15:26; result = Rev 21:4
**Classification:** Conditionalist (in second-death identification contexts)

---

### G2348 (thnetos) — Mortal, Subject to Death

**BLB Definition:** mortal; subject to death; that which can die
**Total NT occurrences:** 6 (all in Paul)
**Key uses:**
- 1 Cor 15:53-54 — "this mortal [thneton] must put on immortality" — humans are MORTAL; immortality is put on at resurrection
- 2 Cor 5:4 — "we that are in this tabernacle do groan... that mortality [to thneton] might be swallowed up of life"
**Classification:** Conditionalist (documents human mortality)

---

## Section 5: Hell and Judgment Words

*From etc5-05 (Four Hell Words)*

### H7585 (sheol) — Realm of the Dead (Hebrew)

**BDB Definition:** sheol — the underworld; the realm of the dead; the pit; the grave
**Total OT occurrences:** 65
**KJV rendering:** 25 distinct English phrases — "hell" (31x), "grave" (31x), "pit" (3x)
**LXX Bridge:** H7585 (sheol) → G86 (hades): 58/67 times, **PMI 33.87** (strongest lexical bridge in this study series; dominant non-accidental association) (E138)
**Character:**
- Common destination of ALL the dead — both righteous (Gen 37:35: Jacob; Psa 16:10: David) and wicked (Psa 9:17; Isa 14:15)
- No torment vocabulary in sheol passages
- Not the same as gehenna or the lake of fire — a preliminary, pre-judgment state
- Described as: darkness, silence, cessation of praise (Psa 6:5; 115:17; Isa 38:18)
**N027 established:** Sheol and hades are the same reality across testaments
**Classification:** Neutral (as vocabulary data)

---

### G86 (hades) — Realm of the Dead (Greek)

**BLB Definition:** hades; the realm of the dead; the unseen world; the underworld
**Total NT occurrences:** 10
**Character:**

**Key passages:**
- Acts 2:31 — Christ's soul in hades until resurrection (governs Luke 23:43 via SIS #4a)
- Rev 20:13-14 — hades delivers up the dead at judgment; then cast into lake of fire
- Luke 16:23 — rich man in hades (IB006 governs interpretation)

### G1067 (gehenna) — The Valley of Hinnom; Place of Eschatological Destruction

**BLB Definition:** Gehenna; the Valley of Ben-Hinnom; a place of judgment and punishment; derived from the Hebrew Ge Hinnom (Valley of Hinnom)
**Total NT occurrences:** 12
**Character:**
- Historical site: Valley of Ben-Hinnom, south of Jerusalem; associated with child sacrifice to Molech (Jer 7:31-32)
- Eschatological: Jesus's primary word for the final judgment location
- Uses apollumi (destroy) — not basanizō (torment) — in ALL 12 passages
- Torment vocabulary (basanizō/basanismos) is ENTIRELY ABSENT from all 12 NT gehenna passages (E143)
- Uses destruction imagery: fire that destroys (Mat 10:28: apollumi both soul and body)
- Uses Isa 66:24 as source text (Mark 9:48): objects are pigrê (corpses) in the source
**Key passages:**
- Mat 10:28 — "destroy [apollumi] both soul and body in gehenna" (E026)
- Mrk 9:43-48 — "worm dieth not, fire not quenched" (quoting Isa 66:24; E282)
- Mat 23:33 — "damnation of hell [gehenna]" (forensic/judicial vocabulary)
**IA016 established:** The four "hell" words describe distinct realities; none inherently carries ECT semantic content
**Classification:** Neutral (as vocabulary data)

### G5020 (tartaroo) — To Cast Into Tartarus (Verb)

**BLB Definition:** to incarcerate in eternal darkness (Tartaros); from Τάρταρος (Tartaros — the deepest abyss of Hades in Greek mythology where the Titans were imprisoned)
**Total NT occurrences:** 1 only
**The only occurrence:** 2 Pet 2:4 — "cast [them] down to hell [tartarōsas — Aorist Active Participle], and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment"
**Subject:** Fallen angels (only) — NOT human persons
**Character:** Pre-judgment custody; chains of darkness; NOT fire, NOT torment
**E287 established:** Etymologically from Greek mythological Tartaros; Peter's restricted use (angels only; pre-judgment only; darkness not fire) does not endorse the broader Greek Tartaros cosmology (IC003)
**Classification:** Neutral (as vocabulary data)

### G2919 (krinō) — To Judge, Render a Verdict

**BLB Definition:** to judge; to separate; to select; to render judgment; to try, condemn, punish
**Total NT occurrences:** 114
**Judgment use in eschatological contexts:**
- Rev 20:12 — "the dead were judged [ekrithēsan — Aor Pass Ind 3P]" (E268, N043)
- Jhn 5:29 — "resurrection of damnation [kriseōs — from krisis, G2920]"
**N043 established:** Judgment at the Great White Throne uses judicial verb krinō — NOT basanizō
**Classification:** Neutral (as vocabulary data)

---

### G2920 (krisis) — Judgment, Verdict, Condemnation

**BLB Definition:** judgment; a decision, verdict, sentence; divine judgment
**Total NT occurrences:** 34
**Semantic distribution:** 52.9% rendered "judgment"; 23.5% "of judgment"; 5.9% "damnation"; 5.9% "accusation"; 0% = torment
**Key eschatological use:**
- Jhn 5:29 — "resurrection of kriseōs" — the negative resurrection is named after the VERDICT, not the torment (E270, N045)
**N045 established:** The negative resurrection in Jhn 5:29 is "resurrection of judgment/condemnation" using krisis — not anastasim basanismou (torment)
**Classification:** Neutral (as vocabulary data)

### G2851 (kolasis) — Punishment, Penal Infliction

**BLB Definition:** punishment; penal infliction; from G2849 (kolazo = to prune, curtail, restrain)
**Total NT occurrences:** 2

| Occurrence | Context | Classification |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Mat 25:46 | "everlasting punishment [kolasin aionion]" | Neutral — mechanism-neutral; names the category |
| 1 Jn 4:18 | "fear hath torment [kolasin]" | Current experiential fear |

**Etymology (E288):** From kolazo (to prune, curtail, restrain); root = pruning/curtailment, not ongoing torture
**Critical observation (E209):** Kolasis is NOT basanismos (G929 = torment). They are different words with different roots. Mat 25:46 uses kolasis — NOT basanismos — for the punishment outcome.
**IB012 governs:** The inference from "everlasting punishment" to "ongoing eternal conscious torment" requires reading torture content into a word whose root means curtailment/pruning.
**Classification:** Neutral (as vocabulary data)

### G2673 (katargeō) — To Abolish, Render Ineffective, Destroy

**BLB Definition:** to abolish; to render inoperative; to render ineffective; to bring to nothing
**Total NT occurrences:** 27
**Key eschatological uses:**
- 1 Cor 15:26 — "the last enemy that shall be destroyed [katargeō] is death" (E083)
- 2 Tim 1:10 — Christ "abolished [katargeō] death" through the Incarnation (E081)
- Heb 2:14 — Christ came "that he might destroy [katargeō] him that had the power of death, that is, the devil" (E261)
**Observation (E261):** Katargeō is distinct from G622 (apollumi) and G928 (basanizō) — it describes abolishing/rendering inoperative. Applied to the devil (Heb 2:14) and to death itself (1 Cor 15:26) — consistent with a final abolition framework.
**Classification:** Conditionalist (in death-abolition contexts)
