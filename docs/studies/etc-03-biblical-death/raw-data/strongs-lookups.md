## NOTES

- LXX mapping attempted for H4194 and H4191 using --lxx-map but failed:
  SQLite error: "no such function: log" — database issue, not fixable
- G110 (athanasia) has only 3 NT occurrences, all translated "immortality"
- G861 (aphtharsia) translated "sincerity" in 2 occurrences (Eph 6:24; Tit 2:7)
- H4191 (muwth) is the verb form underlying H4194 (maveth, the noun)
- The Greek G2288 (thanatos) functions as the LXX translation of H4194 (maveth)
  in multiple OT passages, establishing the Hebrew-Greek semantic bridge
