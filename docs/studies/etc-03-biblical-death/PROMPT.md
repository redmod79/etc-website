## Study Question

What does "death" mean in the Bible? Is death cessation of existence, separation of soul from body, or separation from God? Examine the Hebrew words maveth (H4194, noun, 160+ occurrences) and mut (H4191, verb, 835+ occurrences), and the Greek words thanatos (G2288, noun, 119 occurrences) and apothnesko (G599, verb, 112 occurrences). Trace the origin of death (Gen 2-3), the nature and meaning of physical death, spiritual death, and the second death (Rev 2:11; 20:6, 14; 21:8).

## Series Context

This is study etc-03 in the "Final Fate of the Wicked" series.

**Prior studies:**
- etc-01-what-is-man (72 items) -- Established that man became a living soul (Gen 2:7), death reverses creation (Ecc 12:7), thoughts perish at death (Ps 146:4), the dead know nothing (Ecc 9:5), the soul can die (Ezek 18:4) and be destroyed (Matt 10:28), and man does not inherently possess immortality.
- etc-02-who-has-immortality (60 items) -- Established that God alone has immortality (1 Tim 6:16), mortals must put it on at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54), eternal life is conditional on Christ (John 3:16; 1 John 5:11-12), the wages of sin is death (Rom 6:23), and no NT passage applies immortality vocabulary to the human soul.
- Master evidence file: D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-master-evidence.md (132 items total across prior studies)

**This study's focus:** Define what "death" itself means in Scripture. Prior studies established facts about human nature and immortality; this study examines the meaning, origin, and types of death. This is foundational for later studies on the state of the dead (etc-04), destruction language (etc-05+), and the second death (etc-13).

## Research Scope and Questions

Investigate these questions using the verses and word studies above:

### 1. Origin of Death
- What does Gen 2:17 mean by "in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (mot tamut)? Did Adam die physically that day? What happened?
- How does Gen 3:19 define what death is ("dust thou art, unto dust shalt thou return")?
- What does barring from the tree of life (Gen 3:22-24) reveal about human mortality?
- How does Rom 5:12 explain the entry of death into the world? What kind of death entered?

### 2. Physical Death -- What Happens?
- What do the OT passages describe as happening at death? (Ecc 12:7; Ps 146:4; Ecc 9:5-6,10; Ps 6:5; 115:17; 88:10-12; Job 14:12,21; 3:17-18; Isa 38:18-19)
- Is death described as cessation of consciousness or as a transition to another form of existence?
- What does the death-as-sleep metaphor teach about the nature of death? (7+ authors use it)
- How does James 2:26 ("the body without the spirit is dead") relate to the creation formula (Gen 2:7)?

### 3. Spiritual Death
- What is "spiritual death" as described in Eph 2:1,5; Col 2:13; 1 Tim 5:6?
- Is spiritual death "separation from God" or something else? What vocabulary is used?
- How do John 5:24-26 and 1 John 3:14 use death language metaphorically?
- What is the relationship between spiritual death and physical death?

### 4. The Second Death
- What is the "second death" (Rev 2:11; 20:6,14; 21:8)?
- The phrase occurs only in Revelation -- what does the text explicitly say about it?
- Rev 20:14 says "death and hell (hades) were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." What does this identify?
- What OT/NT passages does Nave's classify under "second death"? (Prov 14:12; Ezek 18:4; Matt 10:28; 25:41,46; Rom 6:23; 2 Thess 1:9; 2 Pet 2:12; etc.)
- Is the "second death" cessation, ongoing torment, or permanent separation? What does the text state vs. what is inferred?

### 5. Death Vocabulary Analysis
- What is the semantic range of maveth (H4194) across its 160 OT occurrences?
- What is the semantic range of mut (H4191) across its 835 OT occurrences?
- What is the semantic range of thanatos (G2288) across its 119 NT occurrences?
- What is the semantic range of apothnesko (G599) across its 112 NT occurrences?
- How does the LXX translate maveth and mut? Do the Greek translations reveal anything about how the Jews understood death?
- Does the Bible ever define death as "separation of soul from body"? If so, cite the verse. If not, note this absence.
- Does the Bible ever define death as "separation from God"? If so, cite the verse. If not, note this absence.

### 6. Cross-Study Integration
- How do this study's findings relate to etc-01 (man is a living soul, not immortal) and etc-02 (God alone has immortality, wages of sin is death)?
- What does the meaning of death imply for the final fate debate? (Note: do NOT settle the debate here -- that's for later studies. Simply establish what death means.)
