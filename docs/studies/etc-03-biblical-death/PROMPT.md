### Related Existing Studies

| Study | Question | Relevance |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| etc5-01-what-is-man | What is a human being? Body, soul, spirit — separate substances or aspects of one unity? Is the soul immortal? | Foundational: established that man "became" a nephesh (Gen 2:7); that soul/nephesh can die (Ezk 18:4; Rev 16:3); that death reverses creation; that death = sleep (N9); that God alone has immortality |
| etc5-02-who-has-immortality | Who possesses immortality according to Scripture? When and how does a human receive it? | Foundational: established the vocabulary distribution (athanasia/aphtharsia never applied to present human state); immortality is received at resurrection not at death; the deathless state is post-resurrection (Luk 20:36); "life in himself" is a divine attribute |

#### Key Findings from Prior etc5 Studies (for context)

**From etc5-01-what-is-man:**

- Man was formed from dust + breath of God and *became* (hayah) a living nephesh — he did not receive a pre-existing soul (Gen 2:7; E1, E53, N1). Death reverses this: dust returns to earth, spirit returns to God (Ecc 12:7; N4).
- The soul (nephesh/psyche) can die — it is the grammatical subject of dying in Ezk 18:4 (E24, N7). "Every living soul died" (Rev 16:3; E28).
- God alone currently possesses immortality (athanasia, G110) — 1 Tim 6:16 uses the unqualified *monos* (alone/only) (E29, N5).
- Death is consistently called "sleep" across both testaments by Moses, Job, Daniel, Jesus, and Paul (N9). The metaphor implies unconsciousness and awakening at resurrection.
- Multiple authors state the dead lack consciousness: thoughts perish (Psa 146:4), the dead know nothing (Ecc 9:5), no work/knowledge/praise in the grave (Ecc 9:10; Psa 115:17; Isa 38:18-19) (E13-E22, I5).
- The question of the conscious intermediate state (Phil 1:23; 2 Cor 5:8 vs. Ecc 9:5; Job 14:12) was classified I-B Unresolved, with plain statements on both sides. This study may need to address these passages again.

**From etc5-02-who-has-immortality:**

- The three NT immortality-positive words (G110, G861, G862) are never applied to any present human being in any NT text (N13, N16).
- The deathless state ("cannot die any more") is explicitly post-resurrection in Jesus's own teaching (Luk 20:35-36; E82, N3).
- Death is the universal human appointment (Heb 9:27) and the consequence of Adam's sin passing to all (Rom 5:12) (E069, N18).
- Death is "the last enemy" — currently active, its final destruction is eschatological at the resurrection (1 Cor 15:26; E083, N19).
- Man in the fallen state did not possess inherent immortality; the tree of life was the external source God blocked (Gen 3:22-24; N15).
- Wages of sin = death; gift of God = eternal life (Rom 6:23; E072). Death and life are opposite outcomes, not two modes of eternal existence.
- Two I-B items remain Unresolved from etc5-01 and confirmed Unresolved after etc5-02: (IB001) the conscious intermediate state; (IB005) "spirit returns to God" as conscious personal entity.

### Focus Areas

Derived from the Nave's DEATH entry structure and tool discoveries:

1. **The origin of death** — Gen 2:17 (God's warning); Gen 3:4 (serpent's contradiction); Rom 5:12-21 (Adam's sin brought death to all); 1 Cor 15:21-22. The sin-death causal chain appearing across five books.

2. **The Hebrew and Greek vocabulary of death** — H4194 (maveth), H4191 (muwth), G2288 (thanatos), G599 (apothnesko), G622 (apollymi), G684 (apoleia). How each word is used; what senses it covers; whether "death" means the same thing in all contexts.

3. **Three senses of death in Scripture** — (a) physical death (cessation of biological life): Gen 3:19; Ecc 12:7; Psa 146:4; (b) spiritual death (alienation from God while alive): Eph 2:1; Col 2:13; 1 Tim 5:6; Rom 8:6; Jhn 5:24; (c) second death (final, irreversible fate): Rev 20:14; Rev 21:8. Whether these are three aspects of one reality or three distinct things.

4. **Death as the reversal of creation** — Gen 2:7 (dust + breath = living soul); Gen 3:19; Ecc 12:7; Psa 104:29; Job 34:14-15. The creation formula and the death formula.

5. **Death called "sleep"** — DEU 31:16; JOB 7:21; JOB 14:12; JER 51:39; DAN 12:2; JHN 11:11 (Jesus explicitly equates it with death); ACT 7:60; 1CO 15:6,18,51; 1TH 4:14,15. G2837 (koimao) as the primary NT sleep-as-death word. What the metaphor implies about consciousness.

6. **The nature of death: cessation vs. separation** — The Nave's DEATH entry under "Spiritual" and "Second Death" raises the question of whether death = separation from God (a relational concept) rather than cessation of existence. Key texts: Eph 2:1 (dead in trespasses while alive); 1 Tim 5:6 (dead while she liveth); Jhn 5:24 (passed from death to life); Rom 8:6 (carnally minded is death).

7. **Reversibility of death** — First death: reversed by resurrection (Dan 12:2; Jhn 5:28-29; 1 Cor 15:51-57; 1 Th 4:16-17). Miracles of raising the dead (1 Ki 17:21-22; Luk 8:55; Jhn 11:43-44). Second death: irreversible (Rev 20:6 — the second death has no power over the resurrected; Rev 20:14 — death and hades cast into the lake; Rev 21:4 — no more death).

8. **The "second death"** — Nave's entry: PRO 14:12; EZK 18:4,10,13,21,23,24; MAT 7:13; MAT 10:28; MRK 9:43,44; REV 2:11; REV 19:20; REV 20:14; REV 21:8. Whether it is actual death/destruction or eternal conscious torment (this intersects with I-D items from etc5-01 and etc5-02 regarding inherent immortality).

9. **Death as enemy** — 1 Cor 15:26 (last enemy to be destroyed); Heb 2:14-15 (Christ destroys the one who holds power of death); Isa 25:8 (God will swallow up death in victory); Hos 13:14; Rev 20:14; Rev 21:4. Death as hostile intrusion, not divine design.

10. **Death's "hold" on the wicked and the righteous** — Nave's subcategories: Death of the Righteous (PSA 23:4; PSA 116:15; DAN 12:13; LUK 23:43; PHI 1:23); Death of the Wicked (ISA 26:14; REV 20:14; 2TH 1:9). The question of whether the wicked "die again" in the second death or continue to live in torment.

11. **Key I-B items carried forward from etc5-01 and etc5-02** — IB001 (conscious intermediate state for the righteous — Unresolved); IB005 ("spirit returns to God" as conscious person — Moderate toward life-force reading). This study should address these using the expanded death vocabulary and context.

### Carry-Forward Evidence from etc5-01 and etc5-02

The following Master Evidence items are already established and should be referenced (not re-proven) in the analysis:

- **E001-E060** from etc5-01 (especially: E1 Gen 2:7; E2 Gen 3:19; E12 Ecc 12:7; E13 Psa 146:4; E17 Ecc 9:5; E18-E19 Ecc 9:6,10; E20 Job 14:12; E24 Ezk 18:4; E26 Mat 10:28; E29 1Tim 6:16)
- **E061-E088** from etc5-02 (especially: E069 Heb 9:27; E072 Rom 6:23; E073 Rom 5:12; E075 Isa 25:8; E076 Isa 26:19; E077 Isa 26:14; E078 Hos 13:14; E082 Luk 20:35-36; E083 1Cor 15:26; E084 1Cor 15:22)
- **I-B Unresolved:** Master IB001 (conscious intermediate state); Master IB005 (spirit returns = conscious person). This study must address these with any new textual evidence.
- **I-D items:** Master ID001 (inherent immortal soul); Master ID002 (soul that sins = only physical death of body). The second death discussion will intersect with these.

## Series Context

This is study 3 in the ETC5 series: **The Final Fate of the Wicked**.

- etc5-01-what-is-man: What is a human being? (Completed 2026-02-19)
- etc5-02-who-has-immortality: Who has immortality? (Completed 2026-02-19)
- **etc5-03-biblical-death: What does "death" mean? (This study)**
- Future studies in the series will address the intermediate state, resurrection, hell, the lake of fire, and the second death in detail.

The analysis agent must follow the ETC5 series methodology (etc5-series-methodology.md) when writing 03-analysis.md and CONCLUSION.md.
