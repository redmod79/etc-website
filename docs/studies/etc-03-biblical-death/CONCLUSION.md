### 1. Explicit Statements Table (E Tier)

*E tier = what the text directly says. Both sides must acknowledge these as textual facts.*

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | God commanded: "of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." The Hebrew is moth tamuth (Inf. Abs. + Qal Impf.): "dying you will die" — an intensified form conveying certainty. | Gen 2:17 | NEW → E089 |
| E2 | "And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die." The serpent uses the same construction (moth tamuth) negated: lo tamuthun. A direct contradiction of God's statement in Gen 2:17. | Gen 3:4 | NEW → E090 |
| E3 | "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." | Gen 3:19 | → Master E002 |
| E4 | "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." | Rom 5:12 | → Master E073 |
| E5 | "Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression." | Rom 5:14 | NEW → E091 |
| E6 | "That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord." Sin reigns unto death; grace reigns unto eternal life. These are the two opposed outcomes. | Rom 5:21 | NEW → E092 |
| E7 | "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." | Rom 6:23 | → Master E072 |

| E13 | "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish." | Psa 146:4 | → Master E013 |
| E14 | "The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence." | Psa 115:17 | → Master E014 |
| E15 | "For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?" | Psa 6:5 | → Master E015 |
| E16 | The grave is called "the land of forgetfulness"; rhetorical questions in Psa 88:10-12 expect "no" as the answer: the dead do not arise and praise; lovingkindness is not declared in the grave; faithfulness is not in destruction; wonders are not known in the dark. | Psa 88:10-12 | → Master E016 |
| E17 | "The grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee." | Isa 38:18-19 | → Master E022 |
| E18 | "Man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep." | Job 14:12 | → Master E020 |
| E19 | "His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them." | Job 14:21 | → Master E021 |
| E20 | "O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave... If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee." Job expresses a waiting posture in the grave until a future call. | Job 14:13-15 | NEW → E094 |
| E21 | "If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; all flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust." | Job 34:14-15 | → Master E045 |

| E24 | "All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again." Said of man and beast together. | Ecc 3:20 | → Master E011 |
| E25 | "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?" Qohelet treats the ultimate destination of the human and animal spirit as an open/uncertain question. | Ecc 3:21 | NEW → E095 |
| E26 | "Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt." | Dan 12:2 | → Master E023 |
| E27 | Daniel is told: "thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days." The personal address frames Daniel's death as rest (sleep) until "the end of the days." | Dan 12:13 | NEW → E096 |
| E28 | God told Moses: "thou shalt sleep with thy fathers." God himself uses sleep-language for Moses's death. | Deut 31:16 | NEW → E097 |
| E29 | Jesus said "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep." The narrator clarifies "Jesus spake of his death." Then Jesus says plainly, "Lazarus is dead." Jesus uses sleep as an explicit synonym for death. | Jhn 11:11-14 | → Master E047 |
| E30 | "Some are fallen asleep" (v.6); "they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished" (v.18); "firstfruits of them that slept" (v.20); "we shall not all sleep" (v.51). Paul consistently uses koimao for deceased believers throughout the resurrection chapter. | 1 Cor 15:6, 18, 20, 51 | NEW → E098 |
| E31 | "Them which are asleep" (v.13); "them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him" (v.14); "which are asleep" (v.15); "the dead in Christ shall rise first" (v.16). Paul uses koimao (sleep) for the deceased and equates their condition with being "dead in Christ." | 1 Th 4:13-16 | NEW → E099 |
| E32 | Stephen "fell asleep" (ekoimēthē, G2837) after commending his spirit to the Lord Jesus. | Acts 7:60 | NEW → E100 |
| E33 | "You who were dead in trespasses and sins" (v.1); "even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ" (v.5). Paul calls pre-conversion believers "dead" in trespasses while they were physically alive. | Eph 2:1, 5 | NEW → E101 |
| E34 | "You, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him." | Col 2:13 | NEW → E102 |
| E35 | "But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth." A physically living woman is described as "dead" — spiritual death while biologically alive. | 1 Tim 5:6 | NEW → E103 |
| E36 | "To be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace." | Rom 8:6 | NEW → E104 |
| E37 | "He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life." A present spiritual transition from death to life occurs at faith. | Jhn 5:24 | NEW → E105 |
| E38 | "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." (Stated twice.) | Ezk 18:4, 20 | → Master E024 |
| E39 | "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?" | Ezk 18:23 | NEW → E106 |
| E40 | "I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye." | Ezk 18:32 | NEW → E107 |
| E41 | "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death." | Rev 2:11 | NEW → E108 |
| E42 | "On such the second death hath no power" — those in the first resurrection are exempt from the second death; implicitly, those not in the first resurrection are not exempt. | Rev 20:6 | NEW → E109 |
| E43 | "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." The text explicitly identifies the second death as the lake of fire. | Rev 20:14 | NEW → E110 |
| E44 | "Whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." Those not in the book of life are cast into the lake of fire, which is identified as the second death. | Rev 20:15 | NEW → E111 |
| E45 | "There shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." In the new creation, death is absent entirely. | Rev 21:4 | NEW → E112 |
| E46 | "The fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." Rev 21:8 again explicitly identifies the second death as the lake of fire. | Rev 21:8 | NEW → E113 |
| E47 | God "is able to destroy both soul and body in hell [Gehenna]." The word is apollymi (G622): to destroy fully. | Mat 10:28 | → Master E026 |
| E48 | "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish [apollymi], but have everlasting life." The contrast is: complete perishing vs. everlasting life. | Jhn 3:16 | NEW → E114 |
| E49 | "They that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." The wicked dead come forth from graves to a resurrection of judgment/damnation. | Jhn 5:29 | NEW → E115 |
| E50 | "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction [aionion olethron] from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." | 2 Th 1:9 | NEW → E116 |
| E51 | "These, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil... and shall utterly perish in their own corruption." False teachers are compared to animals made for destruction and said to utterly perish. | 2 Pet 2:12 | NEW → E117 |
| E52 | "Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." The everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels. | Mat 25:41 | NEW → E118 |
| E53 | "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment [aionion kolasin]: but the righteous into life eternal [zoen aionion]." The same adjective aionion modifies both punishment (for the wicked) and life (for the righteous). | Mat 25:46 | NEW → E119 |
| E54 | "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." Death is currently an active enemy; its destruction is a future event. | 1 Cor 15:26 | → Master E083 |
| E55 | "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces." God's defeat of death is a future eschatological event. | Isa 25:8 | → Master E075 |
| E56 | "I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction." | Hos 13:14 | → Master E078 |
| E57 | "Christ Jesus, who hath abolished [katargeo] death, and hath brought life and immortality [aphtharsian] to light through the gospel." | 2 Tim 1:10 | → Master E081 |
| E58 | "[Christ came] that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage." | Heb 2:14-15 | → Master E086 |
| E59 | "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore... and have the keys of hell and of death." Christ was dead and is now permanently alive; he holds authority over death and Hades. | Rev 1:18 | NEW → E120 |
| E60 | "Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth." Jesus uses sleep-language for Jairus's daughter who the crowd knew to be dead. At restoration: "her spirit came again, and she arose." | Luk 8:52-55 | NEW → E121 |
| E61 | "Let this child's soul [nephesh] come into him again... the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived." The nephesh departed at death and returned at restoration. | 1 Kgs 17:21-22 | NEW → E122 |
| E62 | The rich man in Hades "lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom." He cried: "I am tormented in this flame." Abraham confirms: "thou art tormented." | Luk 16:23-25 | NEW → E123 |
| E63 | "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." | 1 Cor 15:22 | → Master E084 |
| E64 | "It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment." | Heb 9:27 | → Master E069 |
| E65 | "[The wicked dead] are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish." | Isa 26:14 | → Master E077 |
| E66 | "Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust." The righteous dead will arise from dust. | Isa 26:19 | → Master E076 |

| E69 | "I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better." Paul connects his physical death (departing) with being with Christ. | Phil 1:23 | → Master E039 |
| E70 | "We are... willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord." Paul calls being absent from the body equivalent to being present with the Lord. Note: the same passage (2 Cor 5:4) states Paul does NOT want to be "unclothed" but wants mortality "swallowed up of life." | 2 Cor 5:8 (with 5:4 context) | → Master E038 |
| E71 | John sees in vision "under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God" crying out; they are told to "rest yet for a little season." | Rev 6:9-11 | → Master E051 |
| E72 | "The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished." Those outside the first resurrection are described as "not living" during the millennium. | Rev 20:5 | NEW → E124 |
| E73 | "For to be carnally minded is death" (Rom 8:6); "if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die" (Rom 8:13). Present spiritual condition leads to death; the Spirit-led life leads to life. | Rom 8:6, 13 | NEW → E125 |
| E74 | G622 (apollymi) is the word for "perish" in John 3:16 ("should not perish") and "destroy" in Matt 10:28 ("destroy both soul and body"). Its basic definition is "to destroy fully" or "to perish completely." | John 3:16; Matt 10:28 (word-study) | NEW → E126 |
| E75 | H4191 (muwth) and G2288 (thanatos) are the primary OT and NT words for death. The Greek thanatos is placed by Paul in direct opposition to zoe (life) in Romans 5-8 and 1 Corinthians 15 — they are antithetical, not two modes of the same existence. | Rom 5:12,17,21; 8:6; 1 Cor 15:21,26 (word-study survey) | NEW → E127 |

### 2. Necessary Implications Table (N Tier)

*N tier = what unavoidably follows from explicit statements. Stricter N-tier test applied.*

Items from etc5-01/02 are noted with their Master ID.

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Death entered the world through Adam's sin; before the fall, death was not the universal human condition. | E4 (Rom 5:12: "by sin death entered the world"); E1 (Gen 2:17: death was the stated consequence of specific disobedience, not a pre-existing condition) | Rom 5:12 states the sequence: sin → death entered. The text makes Adam's sin the entry point. Before the entry of death, death was not present. This follows directly from the causal statement "death by sin." Both sides must acknowledge the causal direction in the text. | NEW → N020 |
| N2 | At death, the process of Gen 2:7 reverses: dust returns to earth; breath/spirit returns to God; thoughts perish simultaneously. | E3/E002 (Gen 3:19: dust returns); E12/E012 (Ecc 12:7: spirit returns to God); E13/E013 (Psa 146:4: thoughts perish in that very day) | All three components are stated explicitly in separate texts: (1) dust returns (Gen 3:19); (2) spirit returns to God (Ecc 12:7); (3) thoughts perish on the day of death (Psa 146:4). The combination requires no added concept — it simply aggregates what three texts directly say about the components of death. | → Master N004 (extension) |
| N3 | Death is described as a sleep from which the dead await awakening — by Jesus himself, by Paul across multiple epistles, and in OT prophetic literature — consistently and without exception in the biblical record. | E29/E047 (Jhn 11:11-14: Jesus = sleep); E26/E023 (Dan 12:2: sleep in dust); E28/E097 (Deut 31:16: God's speech); E30/E098 (1 Cor 15 koimao); E31/E099 (1 Th 4 koimao); E32/E100 (Acts 7:60) | The sleep metaphor for death is used by God, Jesus, prophets, and apostles. It is not a single author's metaphor but a consistent pattern across both testaments. Both sides must acknowledge the breadth of attestation of the metaphor. | → Master N009 (extension) |
| N4 | Scripture uses the word "death" in at least three distinct registers: (a) physical death — cessation of biological life; (b) spiritual death — the condition of the living sinner alienated from God; (c) second death — the final eschatological outcome in the lake of fire. | E3 (physical: dust returns — Gen 3:19); E33/E101 (spiritual: dead in trespasses — Eph 2:1,5); E35/E103 (spiritual: dead while she liveth — 1 Tim 5:6); E43/E110 (second: lake of fire = second death — Rev 20:14); E46/E113 (second: Rev 21:8) | Each of these registers uses "death" vocabulary (G2288 thanatos; G3498 nekros; H4191/H4194) for a different referent: one for biological cessation, one for a present condition of the living, one for a future eschatological event. Both ECT and conditionalist scholars acknowledge these three senses exist in the text. The distinctions are in the text itself (Eph 2:1 applies nekros to biologically alive people; Rev 20:14 explicitly names the second death). | NEW → N020 |
| N5 | The second death IS the lake of fire, by explicit textual identification. | E43/E110 (Rev 20:14: "this is the second death"); E46/E113 (Rev 21:8: "which is the second death") | Both Rev 20:14 and Rev 21:8 use predicative identification ("This IS the second death"; "which IS the second death") to equate the second death with the lake of fire. No interpretation is required — the text provides the definition. | NEW → N021 |
| N6 | Those in the first resurrection are exempt from the second death; those not in the first resurrection face it (since they face the second judgment and the lake of fire — Rev 20:5-15). | E42/E109 (Rev 20:6: first resurrection = exempt from second death); E72/E124 (Rev 20:5: the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years); E44/E111 (Rev 20:15: those not in book of life cast into lake of fire) | Rev 20:6 states exemption for the first resurrection participants. Rev 20:5 states the rest of the dead did not live during the millennium. Rev 20:15 states those not in the book of life are cast into the lake (= second death). The combination yields the conclusion without added concepts. | NEW → N022 |
| N7 | The dead are explicitly described as lacking consciousness, thought, knowledge, praise, and participation in earthly affairs — consistently across multiple independent biblical authors. | E9/E017 (Ecc 9:5); E10/E018 (Ecc 9:6); E11/E019 (Ecc 9:10); E13/E013 (Psa 146:4); E14/E014 (Psa 115:17); E15/E015 (Psa 6:5); E16/E016 (Psa 88:10-12); E17/E022 (Isa 38:18-19); E18/E020 (Job 14:12); E19/E021 (Job 14:21) | Each of these statements explicitly asserts something the dead do NOT do: no knowledge, no thoughts, no praise, no remembrance, no participation in earthly affairs. Multiple independent authors (Qohelet, psalmists, Hezekiah, Job) make these statements without qualification. Both sides must acknowledge what these texts say about the dead's activities. | → Master N009 (partial basis); this extends it as a separate N item. NEW → N023 |
| N8 | God alone currently possesses immortality (athanasia); mortals must put on immortality at the resurrection. | E29/E029 (1 Tim 6:16); Master E031 (1 Cor 15:53); Master E032 (1 Cor 15:54) | Established in etc5-01 and etc5-02. Confirmed in this study's context. | → Master N005 |
| N9 | Death is the universal human appointment and the consequence of Adam's sin passing to all. | E4/E073 (Rom 5:12); E64/E069 (Heb 9:27) | Established in etc5-02. | → Master N018 |
| N10 | Death (the last enemy) is currently an active power; its final destruction is a future eschatological event. | E54/E083 (1 Cor 15:26); E55/E075 (Isa 25:8); E56/E078 (Hos 13:14) | Established in etc5-02. | → Master N019 |
| N11 | Job's description of death as a waiting period in the grave until a future call (Job 14:13-15) frames death as a state of unconscious waiting, not as a period of continued active existence. | E20/E094 (Job 14:13-15: "I will wait, till my change come; thou shalt call, and I will answer thee"); E18/E020 (Job 14:12: "they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep") | Job describes the dead man's activity during death as "waiting" — in the grave, until the call comes. The waiting = the inactive, asleep state of Job 14:12. The future "call" = the resurrection event. The combination of vv.12 and 13-15 makes the waiting = sleeping posture explicit. This follows directly from what the text says without adding concepts. | NEW → N024 |

### 3. Inferences Table (4-Type Taxonomy)

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that humans do not possess an inherently immortal soul; the soul is mortal until God grants immortality at the resurrection. | I-A | E029 (God alone has immortality — 1 Tim 6:16); E031 (mortal must put on immortality — 1 Cor 15:53); E038 (soul that sins shall die — Ezk 18:4); E026 (God can destroy soul — Matt 10:28); N005, N006, N007, N008 (established in etc5-01/02). | No single verse states "humans do not possess an inherently immortal soul." Systematic conclusion. | #5 (systematizing) | → Master IA003 |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that the state of the dead is one of complete unawareness — no thought, no knowledge, no praise — until the resurrection. | I-A | N007/N023 (multiple authors: dead lack consciousness); E9-E19 (ten explicit texts from Psalms, Ecc, Job, Isaiah); E18/E020, E19/E021 (Job 14:12,21); N003/N009 (death = sleep consistently). | No single verse states "the dead are unconscious." Systematic conclusion. | #5 (systematizing); #4a (Ecc 9:5 interprets sleep metaphor) | → Master IA005 |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that "death" in Scripture has a unified underlying meaning: the condition of being cut off from the source of life (God), which expresses itself in three registers — physical, spiritual, and eschatological — rather than being three unrelated homonyms. | E33-E36 (Eph 2:1,5; Col 2:13; 1 Tim 5:6; Rom 8:6: spiritual death = condition of alienation from God while physically alive); E3/E002 (physical death = dust returns, life ends); E43/E110 (second death = lake of fire); N020 (N4: three registers attested). John 3:16 (E48/E114: not perish vs. eternal life); Rom 6:23 (E7/E072: wages = death; gift = eternal life). | No single verse states "death is the unified condition of being cut off from God's life." This is a theological synthesis organizing the three attested senses into a coherent framework. All components are in E/N tables. | #5 (systematizing) | NEW → IA012 |
| I4 | The Bible teaches that the "second death" is actual death — final and irreversible destruction of the whole person — rather than a permanent state of ongoing conscious torment. | E43/E110 (Rev 20:14: second death = lake of fire); E44/E111 (Rev 20:15: cast into lake = second death for those not in book); E47/E026 (Matt 10:28: God destroys both soul and body — apollymi); E48/E114 (John 3:16: not perish vs. eternal life — apollymi); E50/E116 (2 Th 1:9: everlasting destruction); E51/E117 (2 Pet 2:12: utterly perish); N021, N022 (second death = lake of fire; wicked face it). The consistent vocabulary: apollymi (perish/destroy), olethros (destruction), and the name "death" itself. | No single verse states "the second death is annihilation." This systematizes the destruction/death vocabulary from multiple passages into a comprehensive claim about what the second death involves. The claim aligns with all the E/N items that use destruction vocabulary and the explicit naming of the outcome as "death." | #5 (systematizing destruction vocabulary) | NEW → IA013 |
| I5 | The Bible teaches a conscious intermediate state for the righteous — a state of being "with Christ" or "with the Lord" between death and resurrection. | FOR: E70/E038 (absent from body = present with Lord — 2 Cor 5:8); E69/E039 (depart = be with Christ — Phil 1:23); E68/E050 (today with me in paradise — Luk 23:43); E71/E051 (souls under altar cry out — Rev 6:9-11); E62/E123 (rich man in hades conscious — Luk 16:22-25). AGAINST: E18/E020 (man lies down, rises not — Job 14:12); E9/E017 (dead know not any thing — Ecc 9:5); E13/E013 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4); N005/N005 (God alone has immortality); N006/N006 (immortality at resurrection); N003/N009 (death = sleep consistently); Master E082 (deathless state is post-resurrection — Luk 20:36). | No verse explicitly states "there is a conscious intermediate state." Phil 1:23 and 2 Cor 5:8 are interpreted as implying it; state-of-the-dead passages are interpreted as limited in scope. Both sets of E/N items are genuine. The new evidence in this study (E62: Rich Man and Lazarus — Luk 16:23-25) adds a FOR item not previously classified. | #2 (choosing between possible readings); #5 (systematizing into a doctrine) | → Master IB001 (with update for new E62/E123 item) |
| I6 | The "dead know not any thing" language in Ecclesiastes is limited to earthly affairs "under the sun" and does not address the state of the spirit in God's presence. | FOR qualifier: E12/E012 (spirit returns to God — Ecc 12:7); E10/E018 (dead have no more portion in things done "under the sun" — Ecc 9:6); Master E052 (spirits of just men made perfect). AGAINST: E9/E017 (Ecc 9:5: unqualified in v.5); E13/E013 (Psa 146:4: no qualifier); E14-E16, E17/E014-E016,E022 (multiple independent passages with no qualifier). | Requires importing "under the sun" framework from Ecc's literary structure into v.5, which does not contain it. Resolved in etc5-01 as Moderate (weight against the qualifier). | #3 (applying literary framework); #2 | → Master IB002 |
| I7 | "The spirit returns to God" in Ecc 12:7 means a conscious personal entity (the soul of the person) goes to God in a state of awareness at death. | FOR: E12/E012 (Ecc 12:7); Master E048, E049 (spirit commended to God at death); E69/E039 (depart to be with Christ). AGAINST: E23/E010 (man and beast share ruach); E25/E095 (Ecc 3:21: destination of human spirit = open question); E13/E013 (thoughts perish simultaneously); N011 (ruach = God's animating breath). | "Returns to God" does not specify conscious vs. unconscious. Ecc 3:21 (same author) treats the human spirit's upward movement as uncertain. Resolved in etc5-01 as Moderate (weight toward life-force reading). | #2 (two possible meanings); #4b | → Master IB005 |
| I8 | Luke 16:19-31 (Rich Man and Lazarus) is a literal historical account of the intermediate state, providing factual information about conscious existence in Hades/Abraham's bosom between death and resurrection. | E62/E123 (Rich Man in Hades conscious, in torment; Lazarus in Abraham's bosom; dialogue occurs; "great gulf fixed"). The text contains dialogue, memory, requests, and responses — all suggesting consciousness. | FOR: the narrative is detailed and includes a named character (Lazarus), which is unusual for parables; it describes specific elements of the post-death state. AGAINST: (a) the passage is presented within Jesus's teaching to the Pharisees as a parabolic illustration; (b) the narrative includes physically impossible elements (seeing across a great gulf, dipping finger in water); (c) the primary stated purpose is about wealth and the authority of Scripture (vv.29-31), not eschatological description; (d) the "Hades" location is described differently elsewhere in the NT (e.g., Rev 20:13-14 presents Hades as a temporary state from which the dead are released for judgment). The text provides the content (conscious activity in Hades) but does not state "this is a literal description." The claim adds the assertion of literal historicity to what the text presents as a parabolic teaching. | #2 (choosing between literal and parabolic reading); #3 (applying genre classification to determine level of ontological reference) | ECT | NEW → IB006 |
| I9 | Luke 20:38 ("all live unto him") is a statement about the present conscious state of the dead — the patriarchs are currently alive to God in a conscious intermediate state. | E from Luke 20:37-38: Moses's burning bush account calls God the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (present tense at Moses's time). Jesus draws from this the conclusion "he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him." | The phrase "all live unto him" (pantes gar auto zosin) could mean: (a) all are presently alive to God in a conscious intermediate state; or (b) the covenant relationship between God and the patriarchs implies their future resurrection — from God's perspective the resurrection is certain, making them "living" in that prospective sense. The text itself does not specify which sense is operative. Option (a) adds the concept of present conscious existence; option (b) reads it as a guarantee of future resurrection without asserting present consciousness. Neither sense is stated by the text. | #2 (choosing between two possible meanings of "all live unto him"); #3 (applying a framework — either intermediate state theology or resurrection-certainty theology) | ECT | NEW → IB007 |
| I10 | The death/life antithesis throughout Paul (Rom 5:12-21; 6:23; 8:6; 1 Cor 15:22,26) and John (John 3:16; 5:24-29; 1 John 5:11-12) establishes that death and life are ontological opposites — to be dead means to lack life; to have life means to be alive — and the final fate of the wicked is therefore genuine death (cessation of existence), not another form of life. | E4-E7 (Rom 5:12-21; 6:23 — death is the antithesis of eternal life); E48/E114 (John 3:16 — not perish vs. eternal life); E37/E105 (John 5:24 — passed from death unto life); E67/E068 (1 John 5:11-12 — have/not have life corresponds to have/not have Son); E74-E75/E126-E127 (vocabulary survey: thanatos and zoe are antithetical throughout). | No single verse states "death means cessation of existence and therefore the final fate of the wicked is cessation." This is the systematic conclusion of the death/life antithesis pattern across both testaments. All components are in E/N tables. The claim that the antithesis pattern entails annihilationism for the wicked requires the additional step of applying the pattern to eschatological outcomes — which goes beyond any single verse. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | NEW → IA014 |

Ezk 18:4: the soul that sins shall die (E38/E024, N007). Mat 10:28: God can destroy the soul (E47/E026, N008). | Conflicts with E29/N005, Master E031/N006, E38/E024/N007, E47/E026/N008. Requires redefining "only" (monos), "must put on," and "die" to qualify their plain meanings. | #1, #2, #3; overrides E029, N005, E031, N006, E024, E026, N007, N008 | → Master ID001 |
| I12 | The "soul that sins shall die" (Ezk 18:4) refers only to physical death of the body, not the death of any surviving soul. | Ezk 18:4: nephesh is grammatical subject of dying (E38/E024). Rev 16:3: every living psyche died (Master E028). Lev 21:11, Num 6:6: nephesh met = corpse (Master E043). Matt 10:28: God can destroy the soul (E47/E026). | Overrides E024 by restricting "death" to a scope the text does not specify. Also conflicts with E028/Master E028 and E043/Master E043. | #1, #2; overrides E024, Master E028, Master E043, N007 | → Master ID002 |
| I13 | The phrase "God alone has immortality" (1 Tim 6:16) describes God's pre-eminence, not exclusive possession. | 1 Tim 6:16: "who only [monos] hath immortality" (E29/E029, N005). Rom 2:7: humans seek immortality (Master E030). 1 Cor 15:53: mortals must put on immortality (Master E031). | Requires monos to mean "pre-eminently" rather than "exclusively."

### I-B Resolution Sections

#### I-B Resolution: I5 — Conscious intermediate state for the righteous

*(This I-B was established in etc5-01 as IB001/Master IB001 and remained Unresolved after etc5-02. This study adds one new FOR item: E62/E123 (Rich Man and Lazarus — Luk 16:22-25). The overall resolution question remains the same.)*

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR: E70/E038 (2 Cor 5:8); E69/E039 (Phil 1:23); E68/E050 (Luk 23:43); E71/E051 (Rev 6:9-11); Master E052 (Heb 12:23); **NEW: E62/E123 (Luk 16:22-25 — Rich Man in Hades conscious)**
- AGAINST: E18/E020 (Job 14:12 — man lies down, rises not); E9/E017 (Ecc 9:5 — dead know nothing); E13/E013 (Psa 146:4 — thoughts perish that very day); E14/E014 (Psa 115:17 — dead do not praise); N005 (God alone has immortality); N006 (immortality at resurrection); N003/N009 (death = sleep consistently); Master E082 (deathless state is post-resurrection — Luk 20:36)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E69/E039 (Phil 1:23: depart = be with Christ) | Plain | Didactic epistolary; Paul directly states expectation; propositional language |
| E70/E038 (2 Cor 5:8: absent from body = present with Lord) | Contextually Clear | Didactic epistolary; sits within a passage (2 Cor 5:1-8) where Paul explicitly does NOT want the unclothed/bodiless state — his desire is for the resurrection body (v.4). Scope requires contextual awareness. |
| E68/E050 (Luk 23:43: today in paradise) | Plain | Direct speech by Jesus; "today" is unambiguous in standard reading |
| E71/E051 (Rev 6:9-11: souls under altar) | Ambiguous | Apocalyptic genre; structurally parallel to Abel's blood crying (Gen 4:10, figurative); told to "rest" |
| E62/E123 (Luk 16:22-25: Rich Man in Hades conscious) | Contextually Clear | Parabolic narrative context; detailed conscious activity; named character; primary point of parable is sufficiency of Scripture (vv.29-31), not eschatological description; genre question remains open |
| E9/E017 (Ecc 9:5: dead know nothing) | Plain | Didactic wisdom; direct unqualified propositional statement |
| E13/E013 (Psa 146:4: thoughts perish that very day) | Plain | Different author; didactic psalm; direct statement with "that very day" timing |
| E18/E020 (Job 14:12: lies down, rises not until heavens no more) | Plain | Direct statement about duration; "shall not awake" = no intermediate awakening |
| Master E082 (Luk 20:36: deathless state is post-resurrection) | Plain | Non-apocalyptic didactic discourse by Jesus; explicit timing link to resurrection |
| N003/N009 (death = sleep consistently) | Contextually Clear | Metaphor confirmed by Jesus and multiple authors |

**Step 3 — Weight:**

FOR conscious intermediate state: Two Plain items (E69 Phil 1:23; E68 Luk 23:43); one Contextually Clear (E70 2 Cor 5:8 — but with significant contextual qualification from Paul's own stated preference for resurrection, not disembodied state); one Contextually Clear (E62 Rich Man and Lazarus — but with genre uncertainty); one Ambiguous (E71 Rev 6:9-11).

AGAINST: Three Plain items (E9 Ecc 9:5; E13 Psa 146:4; E18 Job 14:12); one Plain (Master E082 Luk 20:36); plus Contextually Clear N009 (sleep pattern).

The addition of E62 (Rich Man and Lazarus, Contextually Clear) adds weight to the FOR side compared to etc5-02, but the genre uncertainty prevents it from reaching Plain status.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**

The plain statements about the dead having no knowledge (E9 Ecc 9:5), thoughts perishing that very day (E13 Psa 146:4), and remaining in sleep until no more heavens (E18 Job 14:12) are didactic, universal-scope statements from multiple independent authors. They are maximally clear by the criteria: direct vocabulary, didactic genre, universal scope, unqualified form.

Jesus's explicit statement that the deathless/angel-equal condition belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection (Master E082) is a didactic, non-apocalyptic statement directly addressing the post-death state of the resurrection participants.

Phil 1:23 (E69) and Luk 23:43 (E68) are Plain items on the FOR side. Paul's own context (2 Cor 5:4) indicates his preference is resurrection over disembodied existence, creating a tension within Paul's own writing. Luk 23:43's "today" is subject to punctuation debate (which is external to the text; the Greek has no punctuation).

Rich Man and Lazarus (E62): the genre question (parabolic vs. literal) cannot be resolved by the text itself, which is presented within Jesus's didactic instruction to Pharisees. The primary stated purpose is the sufficiency of Scripture (v.31), not post-death description.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Unresolved**

Plain statements on both sides prevent resolution:
- FOR: E69 (Phil 1:23) — Plain; E68 (Luk 23:43) — Plain
- AGAINST: E9 (Ecc 9:5) — Plain; E13 (Psa 146:4) — Plain; E18 (Job 14:12) — Plain; Master E082 (Luk 20:36) — Plain

The addition of E62 (Rich Man and Lazarus — Contextually Clear FOR) modestly strengthens the FOR case compared to the IB001 state from etc5-01/02, but does not shift the resolution from Unresolved to Moderate. Plain items remain on both sides.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I6 — "Dead know not any thing" limited to earthly perspective

*(Established in etc5-01 as IB002/Master IB002 — Moderate, weight AGAINST the qualifier. This study adds no new E/N items that change the assessment. Resolution stands: Moderate, weight AGAINST the qualifier.)*

---

#### I-B Resolution: I7 — "Spirit returns to God" = conscious person going to God

*(Established in etc5-01 as IB005/Master IB005 — Moderate, weight toward "animating life-force returning to source." This study adds E25/E095 (Ecc 3:21: Qohelet himself treats the destination of the human spirit at death as an open/uncertain question: "who knoweth?"). This adds weight to the AGAINST side. The Moderate resolution from etc5-01 stands, now with additional supporting evidence. Resolution: Moderate, weight toward conditionalist reading.)*

**Additional note from this study:** Ecc 3:21 (E25/E095) is in the same book, by the same author (Qohelet) as Ecc 12:7. Qohelet, writing after establishing that man and beast share one ruach (3:19), asks rhetorically "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward?" — treating the upward destination of the human spirit as uncertain or unverifiable. This is internally significant: the author who writes "the spirit shall return unto God who gave it" (12:7) earlier treated the human spirit's ultimate trajectory as an open question (3:21). The SIS connection between these two passages within the same book by the same author (a #4a connection) weighs against reading Ecc 12:7 as a confident assertion of conscious personal survival.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I8 — Rich Man and Lazarus as literal historical account

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR literal reading: E62/E123 (detailed conscious activity in Hades — Luk 16:22-25); dialogue, memory, requests, named character (Lazarus)
- AGAINST literal reading (or against treating it as a definitive intermediate state description): The passage's context (didactic teaching to the Pharisees — v.14); the primary stated message (sufficiency of Moses and the prophets — vv.29-31); physical impossibility elements (the gulf, the water-dipping); the parabolic framing; conflict with the sleep-of-death pattern (N009, E018); conflict with "dead know not any thing" (E9/E017); conflict with "man lies down, rises not" until resurrection (E18/E020)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E62/E123 (Rich Man in Hades conscious — Luk 16:22-25) | Contextually Clear | The text describes conscious activity. However, the passage is parabolic narrative with a stated purpose (the sufficiency of Scripture), which introduces genre ambiguity for its ontological claims. |
| N003/N009 (death = sleep pattern — multiple authors, Jesus) | Contextually Clear | Consistent pattern but the metaphor's properties are not self-evidently exclusive of the Rich Man and Lazarus data |
| E9/E017 (dead know nothing — Ecc 9:5) | Plain | Direct didactic statement; unqualified; different literary context |
| E18/E020 (man lies down, rises not until heavens no more — Job 14:12) | Plain | Direct statement about duration of death |

**Step 3 — Weight:**

The primary question is whether Lk 16:19-31 is a literal account or a parabolic illustration. If literal: it is the most detailed picture of conscious intermediate state and directly supports IB001. If parabolic: it does not provide ontological information about the actual intermediate state, and the plain statements (Ecc 9:5; Job 14:12; Psa 146:4) govern.

The text does not internally resolve the genre question. The parable's explicit stated purpose (v.31: if they don't hear Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded even if one rises from the dead) is about Scripture's authority — the post-death scene is the vehicle for this message, not the message itself.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**

The plain passages (Ecc 9:5; Job 14:12; Psa 146:4) are didactic statements about the state of the dead in general. They would need to be restricted or qualified to accommodate the literal reading of Lk 16 as factual description. No explicit textual connection links Luke 16 to those passages in a clarifying way.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Unresolved**

The genre question (parabolic vs. literal) cannot be resolved by the text itself, and is itself an interpretive step (#2 and #3 above). This I-B is newly classified in this study and its resolution is Unresolved within this study's scope. Later dedicated study on intermediate state or on the Synoptic parables genre would accumulate additional evidence.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I9 — Luke 20:38 ("all live unto him") as present conscious existence of the dead

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR present conscious existence: "all live unto him" (pantes gar auto zosin) — present tense; if this means currently alive to God, the patriarchs are presently conscious
- AGAINST present conscious existence: Jesus's argument structure suggests "all live unto him" = guarantee of future resurrection based on God's covenant relationship (cf. the argument from the burning bush tense); the verse's logic is that the resurrection is implied by the divine covenant — "therefore God will raise them"; also: E18/E020 (Job 14:12 — lies down, rises not), E9/E017 (dead know nothing — Ecc 9:5)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Luk 20:38 ("all live unto him") | Ambiguous | The present tense zōsin is in a non-didactic argument from scriptural precedent; the phrase could mean present consciousness or resurrection-certainty; neither reading is demanded by the Greek without contextual judgment |
| E9/E017 (Ecc 9:5) | Plain | Direct didactic universal statement |
| E18/E020 (Job 14:12) | Plain | Direct statement about death's duration |
| Master E082 (Luk 20:36: deathless state post-resurrection) | Plain | Jesus explicitly states when the deathless condition begins |

**Step 3 — Weight:**

Luk 20:38 is Ambiguous as to which sense of "all live unto him" is operative. The plain statements on the other side (Ecc 9:5; Job 14:12) are direct and universal. Master E082 (also in Luke 20, the same discourse) states that the deathless condition belongs to those who have "obtained the resurrection" — future event. If the deathless condition is future, "all live unto him" as a statement of present conscious existence creates an internal tension within Luke 20 itself.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**

The clearer statement in Luke 20 is v.36 (Master E082): deathlessness belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection (future event). If this is the governing statement, then v.38's "all live unto him" is most consistently read as pointing to resurrection certainty, not present consciousness. The clearer statement (v.36: explicit timing for deathlessness = resurrection) interprets the ambiguous one (v.38: "all live unto him").

**Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate** — weight toward "all live unto him" = resurrection-certainty based on divine covenant, not a description of present conscious existence of the dead.

---

### 4. Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements:**

- E89-E127 have been checked against the verse texts gathered in 02-verses.md.
- E90 (serpent's denial in Gen 3:4) is a direct quote of what the text says the serpent said. Legitimate E-statement.
- E95 (Ecc 3:21: "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward") is a direct quote. Qohelet's rhetorical question is what the text says. Legitimate E-statement.
- E96 (Dan 12:13: "thou shalt rest") is a direct quote from God's personal address to Daniel. Legitimate E-statement.
- E97 (Deut 31:16: "thou shalt sleep with thy fathers") is direct divine speech. Legitimate E-statement.
- E106, E107 (Ezk 18:23, 32: God's declaration of no pleasure in the wicked's death) are direct quotes. Legitimate E-statements.
- E108-E113 (Rev 2:11; 20:6; 20:14; 20:15; 21:4; 21:8) are all direct quotes or close paraphrases of verse text. Legitimate E-statements.
- E123 (Luk 16:22-25: Rich Man in Hades) is a description of what the text narrates. Both sides must acknowledge that the text narrates a conscious Rich Man in Hades. [Note: Reclassified from ECT to Neutral in etc5-18 audit — parabolic context (same "certain rich man" formula as Luk 12:16); setting is hades (temporary, N026); contradicts E013-E022 (multiple independent witnesses: dead lack consciousness). The unclear (parabolic narrative) must be interpreted by the clear (didactic statements).] The inference classification applies to whether this is literal or parabolic (IB006).
- E124 (Rev 20:5: "rest of the dead lived not again") is a direct quote. Legitimate E-statement.
- E125 (Rom 8:6,13) is a close paraphrase of the text. Legitimate E-statement.
- E126-E127 are vocabulary survey observations — both are complete lexical facts. Legitimate E-statements.
- No E-items appear to be positional inferences misclassified as E-tier.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications:**

- N020 (three registers of death in Scripture): Does this require interpretation? The claim that Scripture uses "death" in three distinct registers is an observational classification of different texts. Both sides acknowledge Eph 2:1 uses nekros for the spiritually dead-while-alive; both sides acknowledge Rev 20:14 identifies second death with lake of fire; both sides acknowledge Gen 3:19 describes physical death. The classification itself is observable. However: deciding that these are three distinct "registers" of one word rather than three genuinely different phenomena could be debated. Upon reflection, this is more of an I-A (systematic classification) than an N. **Reclassified: N020 (three registers) → moved to I3 (IA012) as a systematizing inference. N020 reassigned to the "death entered by sin" implication.**
- N021 (second death = lake of fire): The two texts (Rev 20:14; 21:8) use predicative identification ("This IS the second death"). The identification is provided by the text itself. No interpretation needed. PASSES all three tests.
- N022 (wicked face second death): The combination of Rev 20:6 (first resurrection = exempt) + Rev 20:5 (rest of dead did not live) + Rev 20:15 (those not in book cast into lake) yields the conclusion without added concepts. PASSES.
- N023 (dead lack consciousness — multiple authors): This is an observational pattern across ten explicit texts. The texts explicitly state what the dead do not do. The pattern-as-pattern is what both sides must acknowledge. PASSES.
- N024 (Job 14:13-15 frames death as waiting posture): The connection between v.12 (sleep until heavens no more) and vv.13-15 (waiting in the grave for a future call) is within the same passage by the same author. The combination of "shall not awake" (v.12) with "I will wait" (v.14, in the grave) yields: death = inactive waiting. Both ECT and conditionalist readers must acknowledge that Job describes his own expected experience in the grave as "waiting" without any conscious intermediate activity. PASSES.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test):**

- IA012 (three death registers = unified condition): Components (Eph 2:1,5; Col 2:13; 1 Tim 5:6; Rev 20:14; 21:8; Gen 3:19) are all in E tables. Systematizes into a theological framework. I-A confirmed.
- IA013 (second death = actual death/annihilation): All components (Rev 20:14; 20:15; Matt 10:28 apollymi; John 3:16 apollymi; 2 Th 1:9; 2 Pet 2:12) are in E tables. Systematizes destruction vocabulary. I-A confirmed.
- IA014 (death/life antithesis entails annihilationism for wicked): All components (Rom 5,6; John 3,5; 1 John 5) are in E tables. Systematizes the antithesis pattern. I-A confirmed.
- IB006 (Rich Man and Lazarus literal): The FOR data (E62/E123) is in the E table. The AGAINST data involves the plain state-of-death passages (E9/E017, E18/E020) which are in E tables. Also requires genre judgment (criterion #2, #3). I-B confirmed.
- IB007 (Luk 20:38 = present consciousness): For and against items are in E tables. Requires interpreting the meaning of "all live unto him" (#2). I-B confirmed.
- ID001, ID002, ID003: All are carry-forwards from etc5-01/02. Confirmed I-D.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test):**

- IA012, IA013, IA014: Do these require any E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value? No — they systematize what the texts say into a theological framework. I-A confirmed.
- IB006: Does not require any E/N statement to change its lexical value. Whether Lk 16 is parabolic or literal is a genre classification question, not a lexical override. I-B confirmed (choosing between readings, not overriding a statement's meaning).
- IB007: "All live unto him" is ambiguous as to scope. The resolution toward resurrection-certainty does not require any E/N statement to mean something other than its value — it simply reads the phrase in the context of the adjacent didactic statement (Luk 20:36). I-B confirmed.
- ID001, ID002, ID003: All require E/N statements to mean something other than their lexical values. I-D confirmed.

**Step E: Consistency checks:**

- I-A items (I1-I4, I10): Each requires only criterion #5 (systematizing). IA013 (second death = actual death) may require #2 (choosing between destruction and ongoing torment as what the second death involves) — upon reflection, since all components in the E/N tables use destruction/death vocabulary, and no single text is being required to mean something other than its lexical value, this remains I-A. Confirmed.
- I-B items (I5-I9): Each has E/N on both sides. Confirmed I-B.
- I-D (I11, I12, I13): Each overrides at least one E/N statement. Confirmed I-D.
- No I-C items are new in this study (IC001 from etc5-01 stands as the only I-C).

**Step F: Verify SIS connections:**

- IB005 resolution (I7): Added E95/E095 (Ecc 3:21) — same author as Ecc 12:7, same book, adjacent chapters. This is a #4a connection (verified textual connection: same author, same book). Documented in I7 resolution.
- IB007 resolution (I9): Uses Luk 20:36 (Master E082) to interpret Luk 20:38. Same discourse, same author (Luke), same chapter — strong #4a connection. Documented.
- IB006 resolution (I8): The genre question is adjudicated by the parable's stated purpose (v.31) — same passage, internal to the text. #4a connection documented.

### 7. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**

- Death entered the world through Adam's sin and was the stated consequence of disobedience in the creation account. Before the fall, physical death was not the universal human condition. (E1/E089, E4/E073, N020)
- The primary death formula in Scripture is the reversal of the creation formula: dust returns to earth; spirit/breath returns to God who gave it; thoughts perish on the day of death. (E3/E002, E12/E012, E13/E013, N004)
- The dead lack consciousness, thought, knowledge, praise, and participation in earthly affairs — stated explicitly by multiple independent biblical authors (Qohelet, multiple psalmists, Isaiah, Job) without qualifications shared by independent witnesses. (E9/E017, E13/E013, E14/E014, E15/E015, E16/E016, E17/E022, E18/E020, E19/E021, N023)
- Death is described as sleep — consistently, by God (Deut 31:16), by Job (Job 14:12), by Daniel (Dan 12:2,13), by Jesus (Jhn 11:11-14; Luk 8:52), by Paul (1 Cor 15; 1 Th 4), by Luke (Acts 7:60), by Peter (2 Pet 3:4). The sleep awaits an awakening at the resurrection. (E28-E32/E097-E100, N009)
- Scripture uses "death" in at least three distinguishable registers: physical cessation, spiritual alienation from God while alive, and the eschatological second death. Context determines which is operative. (E33-E36/E101-E104, E43/E110, E46/E113)
- The second death IS the lake of fire, by explicit textual identification in Rev 20:14 and Rev 21:8. (E43/E110, E46/E113, N021)
- Those in the first resurrection are exempt from the second death (Rev 20:6); those not in the book of life are cast into the lake of fire (Rev 20:15 = second death). (E42/E109, E44/E111, N022)
- In the new creation, there is no death — death is one of the "former things" that are completely abolished (Rev 21:4). (E45/E112)
- Death and eternal life are consistently presented as antithetical — opposite outcomes, not two modes of the same existence. Paul places thanatos (death) in direct opposition to zoe (life) throughout Romans 5-8 and 1 Corinthians 15. (E6/E092, E7/E072, E54/E083, E75/E127)
- God can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna (Matt 10:28 — apollymi, "to destroy fully"); the soul is not beyond God's destructive power. (E47/E026, N008)
- The fate of those who do not believe is described as "perishing" (apollymi — John 3:16), "everlasting destruction" (2 Th 1:9), and "utterly perishing" (2 Pet 2:12). (E48/E114, E50/E116, E51/E117)
- God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked and desires their repentance and life (Ezk 18:23,32). (E39/E106, E40/E107)
- Spiritual death — the condition of being "dead in trespasses and sins" (Eph 2:1,5) while biologically alive — is reversed at conversion through Christ's quickening. "Passed from death unto life" (Jhn 5:24) describes this present spiritual transition. (E33/E101, E37/E105)
- Death is the last enemy, currently operational, whose eschatological destruction is guaranteed by Christ's resurrection and will be completed at the final resurrection (1 Cor 15:26; Isa 25:8; Rev 20:14; 21:4). (E54/E083, E55/E075, E45/E112, N010/N019)
- God alone currently possesses immortality (1 Tim 6:16). Mortals receive immortality at the resurrection, not at death. (N005, N006 — from etc5-01/02)

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**

- The Bible explicitly states that the second death is a permanent state of ongoing conscious torment (rather than actual death). The text identifies the second death as "death" — the same word as physical death — and equates it with the lake of fire. It does not in the relevant passages (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8) use "torment" language for the general human wicked in the second death. That inference requires additional passages (such as Rev 20:10, applied to the devil/beast/false prophet, or Matt 25:46, which requires interpretation) and is classified I-A at best. *(The devil's/beast's torment in Rev 20:10 is addressed in later studies.)*
- The Bible explicitly states that death is only separation (soul from body, or person from God), not cessation of the person's existence. The explicit death formula describes dust returning to earth, breath returning to God, and thoughts perishing — cessation of the living-person-as-constituted is described. The "separation only" reading of death is an inference that requires additional steps.
- Ecclesiastes 9:5 ("the dead know not any thing") is definitively restricted to earthly perspective and does not apply to the spirit in God's presence. The "under the sun" qualifier appears in v.6 (restricting the dead's portion in earthly affairs) but not in v.5. Multiple parallel passages from independent authors state the same thing without any such qualifier. (I6/IB002 resolves Moderate against the restriction.)
- The Bible explicitly describes a conscious intermediate state between death and the resurrection. Phil 1:23 and 2 Cor 5:8 describe Paul's expectation and preference but do not specify the mechanism or timing. Luk 23:43 ("today shalt thou be with me in paradise") is the most direct evidence for an immediate conscious post-death experience but is subject to punctuation and genre considerations. Luk 16:22-25 (Rich Man and Lazarus) depicts conscious activity in Hades but is presented in a parabolic narrative context. These remain I-B items, with IB001 Unresolved. (I5, I6, I7, I8, I9)
- The "spirit returns to God" in Ecc 12:7 necessarily means a conscious personal entity goes to God in awareness. The same spirit/ruach is shared with animals (Ecc 3:19) and Qohelet himself treats the upward destiny of the human spirit as uncertain (Ecc 3:21). (I7/IB005 resolves Moderate toward life-force reading.)
- Luke 20:38 ("all live unto him") necessarily describes the present conscious state of the dead. The phrase appears in Jesus's argument for resurrection from the burning bush, where the more explicit adjacent statement (v.36: the deathless condition belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection) governs the interpretation of the ambiguous phrase. (I9/IB007 resolves Moderate toward resurrection-certainty reading.)
- The Bible explicitly states that humans possess an immortal soul that survives death. Multiple explicit texts state the opposite: the soul can die (Ezk 18:4), God can destroy the soul (Matt 10:28), and God alone currently possesses immortality (1 Tim 6:16). (I11/ID001 is I-D)
