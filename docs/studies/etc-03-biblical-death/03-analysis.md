### Section A: Origin of Death

---

#### Genesis 2:15-17 — "Thou Shalt Surely Die"

**Context:** God instructs Adam in Eden before the creation of Eve. The one prohibition is eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

**Direct statement:** "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (v.17). The Hebrew is moth tamuth — infinitive absolute + Qal imperfect = emphatic certainty: "dying you will die" / "you shall certainly die."

**Key observations:**
- The warning is addressed to a living human being who is currently in a state of life.
- The word "die" (H4191 muwth) is the standard Hebrew verb for death; the intensified form conveys inevitability and certainty, not a spiritual metaphor exclusively.
- God's warning names death as the consequence of a specific action — eating. Death is framed as the penalty for disobedience.
- The phrase "in the day" introduces an interpretive question: did the dying begin immediately (progressive dying), or was the timing symbolic? The text does not specify which.

**Cross-references:** Gen 3:4 (the serpent's direct contradiction: "Ye shall not surely die"); Gen 3:19 (God's subsequent sentence: "unto dust shalt thou return" — the physical completion of the death sentence); Rom 5:12 (Paul's interpretation: "by sin death entered the world").

**Established items:** E002 (dust returns to dust); E003 (tree of life blocked to prevent immortality in fallen state). From etc5-02: E073 (death passed upon all men by Adam's sin).

---

#### Genesis 3:4 — The Serpent's Contradiction

**Context:** The serpent responds to the woman's report of God's prohibition.

**Direct statement:** "And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die."

**Key observations:**
- The serpent uses the identical Hebrew construction (moth tamuth) negated: lo tamuthun. It is a direct inversion of God's warning in 2:17.
- The text presents this as a contradiction of God's explicit statement. The narrative does not arbitrate — it simply records both statements.
- What follows the eating: physical changes occur (eyes opened), expulsion from the garden, and God explicitly states the prevention of immortal life (3:22-24). The narrative's outcome is consistent with God's warning, not the serpent's denial.

**Key observations for death study:** The serpent's denial of death ("ye shall not surely die") is one of two positions available in the narrative. The narrative structure, culminating in expulsion from the tree of life, supports the reading that death did begin with the fall.

---

#### Genesis 3:17-19 — "Unto Dust Shalt Thou Return"

**Context:** God pronounces sentence on Adam after the fall.

**Direct statement:** "for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" (v.19).

**Key observations:**
- This directly echoes the creation formula of Gen 2:7 (man formed from dust + breath). The return to dust is the reversal of formation.
- No exception is stated: "thou shalt return" is unconditional in the text.
- The sentence is addressed to the physical/material aspect of the human person — the body made from the ground.

**Established items:** E002 (dust to dust — Master E002). N004 (death = reversal of creation formula). From etc5-01, this and Ecc 12:7 together establish the death formula as the inversion of the creation formula.

---

#### Romans 5:12-21 — Death Through Adam

**Context:** Paul's extended theological reflection on the two heads of humanity — Adam and Christ.

**Direct statement (v.12):** "by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."

**Direct statement (v.14):** "death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression."

**Direct statement (v.21):** "that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life."

**Key observations:**
- Paul treats "death" here as the consequence of Adam's sin. The word translated "death" is G2288 (thanatos), the standard NT noun.
- "Death reigned" — thanatos is personified as a ruling power. This is consistent with 1 Cor 15:26 where death is "the last enemy."
- The contrast throughout is sin/death vs. righteousness/eternal life. These are presented as opposites, not as two modes of the same existence.
- V.21 frames the contrast: sin reigned unto death; grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life. Death and eternal life are opposite outcomes.

**Established items:** E073 (death passed upon all men — Master E073), N018 (death = universal human appointment from Adam's sin — Master N018), E072 (wages of sin = death — Master E072).

**Word study note:** G2288 (thanatos) here covers the full range of death — it began with Adam's sin, reigned as a power, and will be overcome by Christ. The "death" that entered through sin encompasses more than biological cessation; it is the condition of mortal humanity under judgment.

---

#### Romans 6:23 — "The Wages of Sin Is Death"

**Context:** Paul concludes a chapter on freedom from sin through death to the old life and life to God. He has been using the death/life contrast throughout the chapter.

**Direct statement:** "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."

**Key observations:**
- The Greek is a pure nominal sentence (no verb "is"): thanatos (nominative) as predicate — death IS the earned result.
- The contrast is complete: death vs. eternal life. These are presented as the two opposite outcomes of two opposite relationships (sin vs. God through Christ).
- "Wages" (opsonia) is what is owed, earned, deserved — death is what sin pays. "Gift" (charisma) is freely given — eternal life is not earned but given.
- The verse does not elaborate on what "death" entails — it simply names it as the antithesis of eternal life.

**Cross-references:** Jas 1:15 ("sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death"); Ezk 18:4,20 ("the soul that sinneth, it shall die" — E024).

**Established items:** E072 (Master E072).

---

#### James 1:13-15 — Sin Produces Death

**Context:** James addresses the source of temptation (not God, but one's own desires) and traces the progression from desire to sin to death.

**Direct statement:** "Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death."

**Key observations:**
- The progression is biological in imagery: lust conceives → sin is born → sin is finished/completed → death is born. Death is the terminal product of completed sin.
- This is consistent with Gen 2:17 (death = consequence of disobedience) and Rom 6:23 (death = wages of sin).
- The word "death" (thanatos) is used without qualification or metaphorical marker. In context, James appears to be speaking of the final outcome of a life of sin.

### Section B: Physical Death — The State of the Dead

---

#### Ecclesiastes 9:1-10 — "The Dead Know Not Any Thing"

**Context:** Qohelet has been surveying the futility of life "under the sun." Chapter 9 opens with a reflection on universal mortality affecting all people — righteous and wicked alike.

**Direct statements:**
- v.3: "after that they go to the dead" — a simple statement that all people go to the dead.
- v.5: "the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten."
- v.6: "their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun."
- v.10: "there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."

**Key observations:**
- The statement in v.5 ("the dead know not any thing") has no internal qualifier — it does not say "the dead know not earthly things" or "the dead know nothing about what happens under the sun." Verse 5 stands as an absolute statement.
- Verse 6 does use the "under the sun" qualifier — but it applies to the dead's "portion" (a share in earthly affairs), not to their knowledge. The qualifier in v.6 restricts their participation in earthly life; it does not restrict the scope of the knowledge-statement in v.5.
- Verse 10 locates the lack of work/wisdom specifically "in the grave" (sheol) — the place to which the person goes at death.
- These verses are already established in etc5-01: E017 (v.5), E018 (v.6), E019 (v.10). The "under the sun" qualification was addressed in I-B Resolution IB002 (from etc5-01), which resolved Moderate against the qualifier.

**Cross-references:** Psa 146:4 (E013: thoughts perish that very day); Psa 115:17 (E014: dead do not praise); Psa 6:5 (E015: no remembrance in death); Psa 88:10-12 (E016: land of forgetfulness); Isa 38:18-19 (E022: grave cannot praise).

**This study's specific contribution:** The description "they go to the dead" (v.3) confirms that physical death is the subject of the passage. The dead are those who have experienced the universal physical death described throughout the chapter. There is no indication that a surviving conscious part of the person is excluded from the "know not any thing" statement.

---

#### Ecclesiastes 12:1-7 — "The Spirit Shall Return unto God Who Gave It"

**Context:** The final chapter of Ecclesiastes uses extended allegory (vv.2-6) for the aging body/death. Verse 7 is the explicit conclusion of the allegory.

**Direct statement (v.7):** "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit [ruach] shall return unto God who gave it."

**Key observations:**
- Two returns at death: (1) dust to earth; (2) spirit/ruach to God.
- The spirit "returns" (shub) — the same word for the dust returning to earth. Both movements are parallel returns to source.
- "Who gave it" — God is the owner and original giver of the ruach. It returns to him.
- The text does not state that the ruach continues in conscious personal existence with God. It says the ruach returns to God who gave it. The condition of the ruach after returning is not described.
- Ecc 3:21 (in the same book, by the same author): "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?" — Qohelet himself treats the upward/downward destination of the respective spirits as an open question ("who knoweth?").
- Ecc 3:19-20 establishes that man and beast share one ruach; both go to one place; all are dust. This complicates a reading of the ruach in 12:7 as a conscious personal entity, since the same ruach is shared with animals.

**Established items:** E012 (Master E012). The question of whether Ecc 12:7's "spirit returns to God" describes a conscious personal entity was addressed in IB005 (from etc5-01), resolved Moderate toward the "animating life-force returns to source" reading.

**For this study:** The return of the ruach to God in Ecc 12:7 is the second half of the death formula. It is parallel to the dust returning to earth. The text does not elaborate on consciousness or personal identity in the returned state.

---

#### Psalm 146:1-4 — "His Thoughts Perish"

**Context:** A psalm praising the LORD who is the only reliable help. Contrast between human princes (who cannot help) and the LORD.

**Direct statement (v.4):** "His breath [ruach] goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish."

**Key observations:**
- Three simultaneous events at death: (1) breath departs; (2) the person returns to earth; (3) thoughts perish.
- "In that very day" (beyom hahu) — the perishing of thoughts is immediate with death, not gradual or deferred.
- "His thoughts perish" (abdu eshtonotav) — the verb abad means to perish, to be destroyed. This is not sleep language but destruction language applied to the thoughts.
- No qualifier limits this to earthly thoughts or earthly consciousness. The verse is from a different author (psalmist) than Ecclesiastes and uses no "under the sun" framework.

**Established items:** E013 (Master E013).

**For this study:** This verse contributes to establishing that "the dead know not any thing" (Ecc 9:5) is not restricted to one author's peculiar perspective — the simultaneous perishing of thoughts with breath-departure is confirmed by a separate author in a separate genre (didactic psalm vs. wisdom literature).

---

#### Psalm 115:15-18 — "The Dead Praise Not the LORD"

**Context:** Concludes a psalm contrasting the living God with dead idols. The living praise the LORD; the dead do not.

**Direct statement (v.17-18):** "The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence. But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore."

**Key observations:**
- "The dead" (hammetim) are explicitly those who "go down into silence" — a phrase confirming the state of the dead as one of silence.
- The statement is categorical: not some of the dead, but "the dead" — the whole class.
- The living are contrasted as the ones who do praise; the contrast is binary: alive = praise possible; dead = no praise.

**Established items:** E014 (Master E014).

---

#### Psalm 88:10-12 — "The Land of Forgetfulness"

**Context:** Psalm 88 is one of the darkest lament psalms, with no resolution. Heman asks God whether the dead can be the recipients of God's wondrous works.

**Direct statements:**
- v.10: "Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee?"
- v.11: "Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?"
- v.12: "Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?"

**Key observations:**
- The rhetorical questions expect "no" as the answer. This is standard Hebrew rhetorical questioning (expected negative answer).
- "Land of forgetfulness" (eretz neshiyah) — the realm of the dead is characterized as the place of forgetfulness. This parallels Ecc 9:5 ("memory of them is forgotten").
- "In destruction" (abaddon) — the realm of the dead is also called Abaddon (destruction/perishing) in this verse.

**Established items:** E016 (Master E016).

---

#### Isaiah 38:18-19 — "The Grave Cannot Praise Thee"

**Context:** Hezekiah's prayer after recovering from near-fatal illness. He is celebrating life and the ability to praise God.

**Direct statement (v.18-19):** "For the grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee."

**Key observations:**
- The contrast is explicit: the grave/death cannot praise; the living can and do praise.
- "The living, the living" — the emphatic repetition underscores that praise belongs exclusively to the living.
- This is the same pattern as Psa 115:17: the state of the dead is one of no praise, no hope, no celebration of God's truth.

**Established items:** E022 (Master E022).

---

#### Job 34:14-15 — "All Flesh Shall Perish Together"

**Context:** Elihu is speaking about God's sovereign control over creation's existence. If God were to withdraw his spirit and breath, all creatures would perish.

**Direct statement (v.14-15):** "If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; all flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust."

**Key observations:**
- The ruach (spirit) and neshamah (breath) are both described as belonging to God — "his spirit and his breath" (possessive of God).
- Their withdrawal = death. "All flesh shall perish together" — the perishing of all flesh is the direct result.
- "Man shall turn again unto dust" — the return-to-dust element is present here as in Gen 3:19 and Psa 104:29.

**Established items:** E045 (Master E045). This verse is part of N011 (ruach belongs to God, is his animating breath).

---

#### Ecclesiastes 3:16-22 — "Man and Beast; One Place"

**Context:** Qohelet reflects on the vanity of human preeminence over animals when both share the same end — death.

**Direct statements:**
- v.19: "as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath [ruach echad]; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast."
- v.20: "All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again."
- v.21: "Who knoweth the spirit [ruach] of man that goeth upward, and the spirit [ruach] of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?"

**Key observations:**
- Man and beast share "one breath/spirit" (ruach echad) — the ruach is not a uniquely human distinguishing feature in this passage.
- Both man and beast go to "one place" (maqom echad) — the same destination.
- Verse 21 treats the divergence of the human and animal ruach at death as an open question ("Who knoweth?") — Qohelet does not assert that the human ruach's upward movement is a conscious surviving personal entity. He treats it as uncertain, or at minimum, not observable.
- This passage is in direct tension with any reading of Ecc 12:7 ("spirit returns to God") that makes the spirit's return a statement about conscious personal survival — because the same ruach is shared with animals who go downward.

**Established items:** E010 (Master E010), E011 (Master E011).

---

### Section C: Death Called Sleep

---

#### Deuteronomy 31:14-16 — "Thou Shalt Sleep with Thy Fathers"

**Context:** God speaks to Moses directly near the end of Moses's life.

**Direct statement (v.16):** "Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers."

**Key observations:**
- God himself uses the sleep metaphor for death. This is divine speech, not human poetry.
- "Sleep with thy fathers" is an idiom for death used throughout the OT (also of kings and patriarchs).
- The phrase implies joining those who have already died — the same state as the fathers.

**Note:** This is the OT prophetic use of sleep-for-death by divine voice. It is one of many OT examples confirming N009 (death = sleep is a consistent pattern across authors and testaments) *(N009 reclassified to IA007 after Study 17)*.

---

#### Job 14:1-22 — "Man Lieth Down and Riseth Not"

**Context:** Job's meditation on human mortality and his longing for a future resurrection. Job 14 is the fullest treatment of death in Job.

**Direct statements:**
- v.12: "So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."
- v.13-15: "O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave... that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee."
- v.21: "His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them."

**Key observations:**
- v.12 states explicitly: the dead do not awake or rise until "the heavens be no more" — the sleep continues until an eschatological event. There is no intermediate awakening. The sleep continues for the entire duration of death.
- v.13-15 is notable: Job expresses a hope for future recall by God from the grave. He frames this as: "I will wait" (in the grave) "till my change come" — the waiting posture in the grave, then a future calling and answering. This supports the sleep/unconscious model — Job waits; God calls; the change comes at resurrection.
- v.21: The dead man does not know about events happening to his family. This is a direct statement about the dead's lack of awareness of ongoing earthly events. It directly contradicts any picture of the dead watching or knowing what is happening on earth.

**Established items:** E020 (Master E020), E021 (Master E021).

**For this study:** Job 14's combination of the sleep-until-the-heavens-no-more (v.12), the waiting posture in the grave (vv.13-15), and the explicit lack of knowledge about earthly events (v.21) constitutes the most detailed OT treatment of the state of the dead. All three elements consistently point to unconscious waiting until resurrection.

---

#### Daniel 12:1-2, 13 — "Sleep in the Dust of the Earth"

**Context:** The conclusion of Daniel's final vision, introducing the resurrection.

**Direct statement (v.2):** "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."

**Direct statement (v.13):** "But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days."

**Key observations:**
- The dead are described as sleeping "in the dust" — directly combining the sleep metaphor with the return-to-dust reality of Gen 3:19.
- The awakening is from the dust, at a future event. The current state is "in the dust" — there is no intermediate conscious state described.
- Verse 13 addresses Daniel personally: he will "rest" (nuach) until "the end of the days." The word for rest here implies the sleep/waiting state between death and resurrection.
- Two groups awake — one to everlasting life, one to shame and everlasting contempt. Both groups are awakened from the same sleep state (dust).

**Established items:** E023 (Master E023). From etc5-02: E025 (Master E023 extended with v.13 data).

**For this study:** Dan 12:2 is the clearest OT text showing that the sleep of death applies to both the righteous (awaking to everlasting life) and the wicked (awaking to contempt). Both are in the same state — sleeping in the dust — until the resurrection.

---

#### John 11:1-14 — Jesus Equates Sleep with Death

**Context:** Jesus delays going to Lazarus after hearing he is sick. He then tells the disciples Lazarus is sleeping.

**Direct statements:**
- v.11: "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."
- v.13-14: "Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead."

**Key observations:**
- Jesus uses the sleep metaphor for Lazarus's death. The narrator clarifies that "sleep" = "his death."
- When the disciples misunderstand, Jesus states plainly: "Lazarus is dead." This shows sleep and dead are used interchangeably here.
- The disciples' misunderstanding (thinking he meant natural sleep) is corrected — "he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep" (natural sleep) vs. Jesus' meaning (death). The text establishes the metaphor clearly.
- This is among the most direct confirmations of the sleep-as-death metaphor in the Gospels, from Jesus himself.

**Established items:** E047 (Master E047).

---

#### 1 Corinthians 15:6, 18, 20, 51 — Sleep Language in Resurrection Context

**Context:** Paul's full chapter on the resurrection. He consistently uses sleep language for the deceased.

**Direct statements:**
- v.6: "some are fallen asleep" (G2837 koimao)
- v.18: "they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished" — if Christ is not risen, the sleeping dead have perished (not: they are alive elsewhere)
- v.20: "Christ risen from the dead, become the firstfruits of them that slept"
- v.51: "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed"

**Key observations:**
- Paul uses koimao (sleep) throughout this chapter as the standard NT term for deceased believers.
- v.18 is particularly telling: if Christ is not risen, then those who have "fallen asleep in Christ are perished." The alternative to resurrection is perishing — not some form of continued existence. The sleep-death metaphor is here connected to the real possibility of perishing (apollymi).
- v.20: Christ is the "firstfruits of those who slept" — the resurrection is described as an awakening from sleep.

**Cross-references with 1 Thess 4:13-17:** Paul explicitly addresses those "who are asleep" (v.13), "which sleep in Jesus" (v.14), "which are asleep" (v.15). The dead in Christ rise at the trump — the sleeping dead are awakened from their sleep at the resurrection event.

---

#### Acts 7:59-60 — Stephen Falls Asleep

**Context:** Stephen is being stoned. His last two acts are committing his spirit to Jesus and praying for his killers.

**Direct statement (v.60):** "And when he had said this, he fell asleep."

**Key observations:**
- Stephen commends his spirit (v.59) and then "falls asleep" — the same koimao word.
- The narrative uses both the spirit-commendation language (parallel to E049, E048 from etc5-01) and the sleep language together, without treating them as contradictory.
- The sleep language is the author's summary of the death; the spirit-commendation is Stephen's personal act of trust at the moment of dying.

**Established items:** E049 (Master E049) for the spirit commendation; sleep language is part of N009 *(reclassified to IA007 after Study 17)*.

---

### Section D: Spiritual Death

---

#### Ephesians 2:1-6 — "Dead in Trespasses and Sins"

**Context:** Paul is describing the pre-conversion state of the Ephesian believers.

**Direct statements:**
- v.1: "you who were dead in trespasses and sins"
- v.5: "even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ"

**Key observations:**
- The word "dead" (nekrous, G3498) is used for people who were biologically alive but in a spiritual condition described as death.
- This is the primary NT basis for "spiritual death" — a metaphorical use of death-language for the condition of sinfulness and alienation from God.
- The contrast is with "quickened" (suzoopoieo, made alive together). Being made alive spiritually is the reversal of this spiritual death.
- The description of the spiritually dead: "walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air" (v.2) — they functioned, acted, thought, desired. Spiritual death does not mean unconsciousness of those who are spiritually dead.

**Key observation for the death study:** This passage establishes that "death" in the Bible has at least two senses: (a) physical death (what the OT sleep and grave texts describe) and (b) spiritual death (the condition of the living sinner). The two are distinct referents of the same word (G2288 thanatos / G3498 nekros).

---

#### Colossians 2:10-13 — "Dead in Your Sins; Made Alive"

**Context:** Paul describes the new life in Christ in terms of circumcision, burial/resurrection in baptism, and being made alive.

**Direct statement (v.13):** "you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him."

**Key observations:** Same pattern as Eph 2:1,5 — spiritual death prior to conversion; quickening (being made alive) at conversion. The language of burial and resurrection in baptism (vv.11-12) uses the death/life cycle figuratively.

---

#### 1 Timothy 5:6 — "Dead While She Liveth"

**Context:** Paul is contrasting a widow who lives in pleasure (self-indulgence) with one who trusts in God.

**Direct statement:** "But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth."

**Key observations:**
- This is the starkest articulation of spiritual death: a person can be physically alive and at the same time be described as "dead." The paradox ("liveth... dead while she liveth") shows that biological life and spiritual life/death are distinct.
- The word for "dead" here is G2348 (tethnethen) — perfect participle of thnesko, "to die." She has died (spiritually) though she is physically alive.
- This use of death-language for a living person confirms that "death" in Scripture covers more than biological cessation.

---

#### Romans 8:1-13 — "Carnally Minded Is Death"

**Context:** Paul contrasts living according to the flesh with living according to the Spirit.

**Direct statement (v.6):** "For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."
**Direct statement (v.13):** "For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live."

**Key observations:**
- "To be carnally minded IS death" — present tense. The state of carnal mindedness is already a form of death in the present. This is death as a present spiritual condition, not only a future physical event.
- "Ye shall die" (future, v.13) — the fruit of fleshly living is physical/eschatological death. The present spiritual condition leads to final death.
- The contrast with "life and peace" shows that death in v.6 is not biological but relational/existential — the opposite of peace with God.

---

#### John 5:24-29 — "Passed from Death unto Life" / Hour of Resurrection

**Context:** Jesus is in Jerusalem, explaining his authority and the coming judgment/resurrection.

**Direct statement (v.24):** "He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life."

**Direct statement (v.28-29):** "The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."

**Key observations:**
- v.24 uses death/life language for the present spiritual transition at faith. "Is passed from death unto life" — the believer has already crossed from the death-state to the life-state, in the present.
- This is the spiritual dimension: the condition of spiritual death (Eph 2:1) is reversed at conversion by hearing and believing.
- vv.28-29 shift to the physical resurrection: "all that are in the graves" (a clear reference to those physically dead and buried) will hear his voice and come forth. Two outcomes: resurrection of life and resurrection of damnation.
- The passage uses death/life language in two senses within four verses: (1) present spiritual transition at faith (v.24); (2) future physical resurrection from graves (vv.28-29).

**Key observation for the death study:** John 5 explicitly connects both senses of death/life within one discourse. This confirms that the Bible uses death-language in at least two registers — and the context determines which sense is meant.

---

#### John 3:14-18 — "Not Perish, but Have Everlasting Life"

**Context:** Jesus's discourse with Nicodemus, including the summary statement in John 3:16.

**Direct statement:** "that whosoever believeth in him should not perish (apollymi), but have everlasting life."

**Key observations:**
- The contrast is: perish (G622 apollymi) vs. everlasting life. These are the two outcomes based on belief or non-belief.
- G622 (apollymi) = to destroy fully, to perish completely. From the word-study: this is the same word used in Matt 10:28 ("destroy both soul and body in gehenna").
- The contrast of perishing with everlasting life frames death/perishing and life as opposites — not as two forms of conscious existence.

### Section E: Ezekiel 18 — The Soul That Sins Shall Die

---

#### Ezekiel 18:1-32 — Full Context

**Context:** God rebukes Israel for the proverb that children bear the parents' iniquity. God establishes individual moral responsibility: each person bears their own sin and its consequences — either life or death.

**Direct statements:**
- v.4: "Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die."
- v.20: "The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son."
- v.21: "if the wicked will turn from all his sins... he shall surely live, he shall not die."
- v.23: "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?"
- v.31: "why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
- v.32: "I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live."

**Key observations:**
- The nephesh (soul) is stated twice as the grammatical subject of dying (tamuth, H4191): "the soul that sinneth, IT SHALL DIE."
- The chapter operates with a binary: die vs. live. These are the two outcomes presented as consequences of sin vs. righteousness.
- The contrast is not: die (physically) vs. live (spiritually) — both "die" and "live" are used within the same ethical framework. The righteous man "shall surely live" (v.9, v.17, v.19, v.21) in parallel with the wicked who "shall die" (v.13, v.18, v.20).
- God's repeated declaration that he has no pleasure in the wicked dying, combined with his plea "why will ye die?" (v.31), presents death as something that ends the person — not as a mode of continued conscious punishment.
- The chapter does not use the word "death" to mean torment or suffering while alive; it is the stated consequence of sin.

**Established items:** E024 (soul that sinneth shall die — Master E024), E025 (soul can be saved alive — Master E025), N007 (soul can die — Master N007), N008 (God can destroy soul — Master N008).

**Note for second death discussion:** The Nave's listing of Ezk 18:4 under "Second Death" cross-references is significant. The chapter establishes the principle that the soul dies as a consequence of sin — this is the foundational statement for understanding the "second death" as actual death (cessation) rather than continued torment.

---

### Section F: Second Death

---

#### Revelation 2:11 — "Not Hurt of the Second Death"

**Context:** The letter to the church at Smyrna. The overcomer is promised exemption from the second death.

**Direct statement:** "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death."

**Key observations:**
- The "second death" is named but not defined in this verse. It is presented as something that can harm or hurt (G91 adikethe = to be wronged/hurt/injured) those who are not overcomers.
- The promise of exemption: the overcomer will NOT be hurt by it. This implies others will be.

---

#### Revelation 20:4-6, 13-15 — "This Is the Second Death"

**Context:** The millennium vision; the great white throne judgment; the final disposal of death and Hades.

**Direct statements:**
- v.6: "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power."
- v.13: "the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them."
- v.14: "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
- v.15: "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."

**Key observations:**
- The text explicitly identifies the second death: it IS the lake of fire (v.14).
- Death and Hades are themselves cast into the lake of fire — death itself is destroyed. This corresponds to the "last enemy destroyed" of 1 Cor 15:26 (E083).
- Those not in the book of life are cast into the lake of fire (v.15) — the same lake that is identified as the second death.
- Rev 20:5 establishes the sequence: the rest of the dead "lived not again until the thousand years were finished" — they were dead (in the typical sense: not conscious, not alive) during the millennium.
- The first resurrection grants exemption from the second death (v.6). Those not in the first resurrection are raised for judgment and face the second death.

**Key observation:** The second death is named "death" (G2288 thanatos with the adjective "second" — deuteros). The text does not use "torment" language for the second death here; it uses death and lake of fire. Rev 20:10 (which mentions torment day and night) is addressed to the devil, beast, and false prophet — not to the general human wicked at this point in the narrative. The distinction in the text between what is said about the devil/beast/false prophet (v.10) and what is said about the general human wicked (v.15) is an observable textual fact.

---

#### Revelation 21:4-8 — "No More Death; Second Death"

**Context:** The new creation vision — God dwelling with his people in the new Jerusalem.

**Direct statements:**
- v.4: "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."
- v.8: "the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."

**Key observations:**
- v.4: "no more death" — the complete abolition of death in the new creation. Death (thanatos) is one of the "former things" that are passed away. This is consistent with 1 Cor 15:26 (death is the last enemy to be destroyed — Master E083) and Isa 25:8 (God swallows up death in victory — Master E075).
- v.8: The second death is explicitly defined as "the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone." The descriptors of v.8 parallel Rev 20:15 — those not in the book of life are cast into the lake of fire.
- The "second death" is presented as the final, definitive fate for those outside the new creation — not as a mode of continued existence within the new creation. In the new creation, there is no death; those in the second death are not in the new creation.

---

#### 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 — "Everlasting Destruction"

**Context:** Paul addresses the Thessalonians who are suffering persecution. He assures them of eschatological justice.

**Direct statement (v.9):** "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction [aionion olethron] from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power."

**Key observations:**
- The word for "destruction" is olethros (G3639) — not apoleia (G684) and not thanatos (G2288), but a third destruction-word.
- "Everlasting destruction" — the adjective aionion (eternal/everlasting) modifies olethros (destruction/ruin). The construction is: the destruction is everlasting.
- "From the presence of the Lord" — the destruction involves exclusion from God's presence.
- The question for this study: does "everlasting destruction" mean destruction that lasts forever (ongoing), or destruction that is final/permanent (whose results last forever)? The text states the noun (destruction) with the adjective (everlasting/eternal); it does not elaborate on whether the process is ongoing or the result is permanent.

**Cross-reference:** Matt 25:46 ("everlasting punishment" — aionion kolasin) uses the same construction with the word for punishment/correction. That passage is examined in later studies (etc5-XX). The parallel structure is noted here.

---

#### Matthew 10:28 — "Destroy Both Soul and Body"

**Context:** Jesus is instructing the twelve before their missionary journey. He contrasts fear of people with fear of God.

**Direct statement:** "fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy [apollymi] both soul and body in hell [Gehenna]."

**Key observations:**
- Two contrasted powers: men can kill the body but not the soul; God can destroy both soul and body.
- The word "destroy" is G622 (apollymi) — the same word used in John 3:16 ("should not perish") and elsewhere for complete destruction.
- The soul is here presented as something that can be destroyed — by God in Gehenna.
- The passage does not say God torments the soul forever in Gehenna; it says he is able to destroy (apollymi) both soul and body there.

**Established items:** E026 (Master E026), E027 (Master E027), N008 (Master N008).

**For this study:** The connection between Matt 10:28 and the second death discussion: if God destroys both soul and body in Gehenna (the second death / lake of fire), this is consistent with the conditionalist reading that the second death is actual destruction. The ECT reading requires "destroy" (apollymi) to mean something other than its lexical value of complete destruction. From etc5-01: ID002 (the claim that "soul that sins shall die" = only physical death) is already classified I-D.

---

#### Matthew 25:41, 46 — "Everlasting Fire / Everlasting Punishment"

**Context:** The judgment of the nations in Jesus's Olivet Discourse / parabolic teaching.

**Direct statements:**
- v.41: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."
- v.46: "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."

**Key observations:**
- v.41: The fire is "prepared for the devil and his angels" — the primary addressees are the devil and his angels. The wicked enter fire that was prepared for those beings.
- v.46: "everlasting punishment" (aionion kolasin) vs. "life eternal" (zoen aionion). The same adjective (aionios) modifies both outcomes. This is an observable grammatical fact.
- The text does not define what the punishment consists in — whether it is ongoing conscious torment, or a final destruction whose results are permanent. "Punishment" (kolasis) can refer to a penalty or correction; it does not exclusively mean ongoing torment in Greek usage.

**Established item:** These verses will be examined in depth in later dedicated studies (etc5-XX on hell/final judgment). For this study: they establish that a final outcome awaits the wicked after judgment, described with the adjective "everlasting." The precise nature of that outcome requires more analysis than this study can provide.

---

#### 2 Peter 2:12 — "Shall Utterly Perish"

**Context:** Peter is describing false teachers.

**Direct statement:** "these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption."

**Key observations:**
- "Utterly perish" (phtharesontai en te phthora auton) — from phtheiro (G5351, to corrupt/destroy). The same root as phthora (corruption) and phthartos (corruptible) from etc5-02.
- The comparison to animals "made to be taken and destroyed" presents their fate as destruction (actual perishing), not ongoing torment.

---

### Section G: Death as Enemy — Eschatological Defeat

---

#### 1 Corinthians 15:20-26, 51-57 — Full Resurrection Chapter

**Context:** Paul addresses those in Corinth who deny the resurrection. He establishes the resurrection of Christ as the foundation for the believers' resurrection and the final defeat of all enemies, including death.

**Direct statements:**
- v.21-22: "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
- v.26: "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."
- v.51-54: "we shall not all sleep... the dead shall be raised incorruptible... this mortal must put on immortality... then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
- v.55: "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"

**Key observations:**
- v.22 establishes the death-through-Adam / life-through-Christ parallel. Both "all die" (universal) and "all shall be made alive" (in Christ, at the resurrection).
- v.26: Death is an enemy. Its destruction is a future event. The present age is characterized by death's continued operation as an enemy (N019 from etc5-02).
- vv.51-54: The transition from mortal to immortal happens "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye" at the resurrection — not gradually, not at death, but at the specific resurrection event.
- v.54 quotes Isa 25:8 ("death swallowed up in victory") — the OT eschatological promise of death's abolition is fulfilled at the resurrection.
- v.55 quotes Hos 13:14 as a taunt over defeated death — the power of death is destroyed.

**Established items:** E083 (last enemy = death — Master E083), E084 (in Adam all die — Master E084), E075 (death swallowed up — Master E075), E078 (ransom from grave — Master E078). N019 (death currently active, destruction eschatological).

---

#### Hebrews 2:14-15 — Christ Destroys the Power of Death

**Context:** The author of Hebrews explains why Christ took on human flesh.

**Direct statement (v.14-15):** "that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."

**Key observations:**
- The devil is described as the one who "had the power of death." Christ destroys this power.
- All humans are described as "all their lifetime subject to bondage" through the fear of death — the universal condition of humanity is bondage to death.
- Christ's method: "through death" — he entered into death to destroy it from within.

**Established items:** E086 (all their lifetime in bondage to fear of death — Master E086).

---

#### Isaiah 25:8 — "Death Swallowed Up in Victory"

**Key observations:** Already addressed above. God will swallow up death; the tears of mourning will be wiped away. Paul cites this as fulfilled at the resurrection.

**Established items:** E075 (Master E075).

---

#### Hosea 13:14 — "Ransom from the Grave"

**Context:** A divine declaration in the midst of judgment oracles against Israel.

**Direct statement:** "I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction."

**Key observations:**
- God declares his intention to ransom from the grave's power and redeem from death. This is divine reversal of death's power.
- The apostrophe to death ("O death, I will be thy plagues") is the OT precursor to Paul's resurrection taunt in 1 Cor 15:55.
- "Power of the grave" (yad sheol) — death/Sheol is here presented as a power that holds the dead.

**Established items:** E078 (Master E078).

---

#### Revelation 1:17-18 — Christ Has Keys of Death and Hades

**Context:** John's vision of the risen Christ who speaks to him.

**Direct statement (v.18):** "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell [hades] and of death."

**Key observations:**
- Christ holds the keys of Hades and death — authority over the realm of the dead.
- "Was dead" (egenomene nekros) and "alive for evermore" — Christ himself experienced death and now has permanent life. This is the model for the believers' resurrection.
- "Keys" = authority to release or retain. Christ's authority over death and Hades means the dead are in his power, not a permanent condition.

---

### Section H: Reversibility of Death

---

#### John 5:28-29 — Hour of Resurrection from Graves

**Direct statement:** "the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."

**Key observations:**
- "All that are in the graves" — physical death is in view; people are in graves.
- "Shall hear his voice, and shall come forth" — the dead are recalled by Christ's voice. This is the general resurrection from physical death.
- Two outcomes: resurrection of life (for those who did good) and resurrection of damnation/judgment (for those who did evil). Both groups are currently in graves — same state — but face different outcomes at resurrection.

**Established items:** This passage was in the scope of etc5-01/02 (cited in PROMPT context). The two-resurrection structure parallels Dan 12:2.

---

#### Luke 20:34-38 — "Neither Can They Die Any More"

**Context:** The Sadducees challenge Jesus on resurrection. Jesus responds by distinguishing the present age (marriage) from the age to come (resurrection).

**Direct statement (v.35-36):** "they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of the resurrection."

**Direct statement (v.38):** "For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him."

**Key observations:**
- The deathless state ("neither can they die any more") is explicitly described as belonging to "those who obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead." It is a post-resurrection condition.
- v.38: "For all live unto him" — this has been interpreted as a statement about present conscious existence of the dead ("they live to God"). The context, however, is Jesus's argument for the resurrection based on the burning bush (v.37): God called himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were currently dead. The argument from "I am the God of Abraham" (present tense) to "therefore the dead are raised" is that God's covenant relationship with the patriarchs implies their future resurrection. The phrase "all live unto him" (pantes gar auto zosin) most naturally refers to the resurrection certainty — all will live to God (through resurrection). An alternative reading is that the dead are now alive to God in some sense. This interpretive ambiguity means it should be analyzed as I-B in the context of the intermediate state question.

**Established items:** E082 (deathless state is post-resurrection — Master E082), N006 (immortality at resurrection — Master N006). The "all live unto him" phrase introduces a new element that was not analyzed in depth in etc5-01/02 and will be noted in the inference section.

---

#### 1 Kings 17:17-24 — Elijah and the Widow's Son

**Context:** The son of the widow of Zarephath dies. Elijah prays for restoration.

**Direct statement (v.21-22):** "let this child's soul [nephesh] come into him again... And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived."

**Key observations:**
- The nephesh "came into him again" at restoration — it had departed. This parallels Gen 35:18 ("as her soul was in departing, for she died").
- The language is parallel to the creation formula: at death the nephesh departs; at restoration it returns.
- This is not a resurrection in the eschatological sense — it is a resuscitation (the child would die again). But it demonstrates the reversibility of physical death in principle.

**Note:** The nephesh's "coming into him again" at the prayer of Elijah mirrors the ruach's "return to God" at death (Ecc 12:7). Just as death = departure of nephesh/ruach, restoration = return of nephesh. The conditionalist and ECT readings of this passage differ: conditionalists read it as life-force returning; ECT proponents read it as a conscious soul returning from God's presence.

---

#### Luke 8:49-55 — Jesus Raises Jairus's Daughter

**Context:** Jesus is told the girl has died; he goes to her anyway.

**Direct statement (v.52, 55):** Jesus says "she is not dead, but sleepeth"; then "her spirit came again, and she arose straightway."

**Key observations:**
- Jesus uses the sleep metaphor for her death (v.52), consistent with Jhn 11:11 and the pattern of N009 *(reclassified to IA007 after Study 17)*.
- At restoration: "her spirit [pneuma] came again" — the pneuma's return = restoration to life.
- The crowd "laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead" (v.53) — her physical death was apparent to observers.

---

### Section I: Key Disputed / Intermediate State Passages

---

#### Luke 23:39-43 — "Today Shalt Thou Be with Me in Paradise"

**Context:** The two criminals crucified alongside Jesus. The repentant criminal asks Jesus to "remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."

**Direct statement (v.43):** "And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise."

**Key observations:**
- This is the most direct NT statement in support of an immediate post-death conscious experience for the righteous. Jesus makes a specific promise with a specific time marker: "today."
- The comma placement (Authorized Version): "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise." If the comma is placed after "to day," the promise is for that same day.
- Jesus died on that same day. If the promise was fulfilled "today," then both Jesus and the thief experienced something that could be called "paradise" on that day.
- The conditionalist resolution typically involves: (a) punctuation argument (comma after "thee," making "today" part of the introductory formula: "I say to you today, you will be with me in paradise" — at the resurrection); or (b) the subjective time argument (IC001 from etc5-01 — the thief's next conscious moment was paradise, even if an interval elapsed).
- Neither punctuation argument nor subjective time argument is derived from the text itself — both are external resolutions applied to interpret the verse. The verse as written (standard punctuation) is a plain promise of paradise "today."

**Established items:** E050 (Master E050). Part of IB001 (conscious intermediate state — FOR side).

**For this study:** This verse is not addressed primarily in the death study — it is about what happens immediately after death, which is the intermediate state question. It is classified as E050 (reclassified to Neutral in etc5-18 audit: Greek has no punctuation; comma placement is editorial; Jesus was in hades that day per E131/Acts 2:31, not paradise; John 20:17: "I am not yet ascended to my Father"), part of I-B Unresolved IB001. The death study notes its existence without resolving it further.

---

#### Philippians 1:20-24 — "Desire to Depart, and to Be with Christ"

**Context:** Paul is in prison facing possible execution. He is reflecting on whether he desires life or death.

**Direct statements:**
- v.21: "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
- v.23: "For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better."
- v.24: "Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you."

**Key observations:**
- Paul frames death as "gain" — something better than continued physical life (for himself, not for the Philippians).
- "To depart" (analusai, to depart/dissolve) "and to be with Christ" — Paul connects departure from life with being with Christ.
- "Far better" — Paul's preference is for departing and being with Christ over continued physical life.
- The text does not describe what "being with Christ" entails mechanistically — whether it begins immediately at death, at resurrection, or at some point in between.
- The critical exegetical question: does "depart and be with Christ" describe a conscious intermediate state, or does Paul expect the resurrection event to follow immediately from his subjective perspective, or is he pointing to the resurrection as the moment of definitive "being with Christ"?
- The text itself does not answer this question. It describes Paul's expectation and preference without specifying the mechanism or timing.

**Established items:** E039 (Master E039). Part of IB001 (FOR side of conscious intermediate state).

---

#### 2 Corinthians 5:1-8 — "Absent from Body / Present with Lord"

**Context:** Paul is reflecting on the resurrection body ("house not made with hands") in contrast with the "earthly house of this tabernacle" (the present body). He expresses a tension between desiring the resurrection body and the present state.

**Direct statements:**
- v.4: "we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."
- v.8: "we are... willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."

**Key observations:**
- Paul's preference in 2 Cor 5 is important context: he does NOT want to be "unclothed" (gymnos, naked/unembodied) — he wants to be "clothed upon" (ependusasthai) with the resurrection body. His desire is for the resurrection body, not for a bodiless intermediate state.
- V.8 ("absent from body = present with Lord") has been interpreted as supporting a conscious intermediate state: when Paul is no longer in the body, he is with the Lord.
- However, Paul's own stated preference is NOT for the unclothed state — he wants to be clothed upon. This is directly relevant: 2 Cor 5:8 states the association of body-absence with Lord-presence, but the broader context (vv.1-7) frames Paul's desire as resurrection, not as an intermediate disembodied state.
- "Mortality might be swallowed up of life" (v.4) — this language echoes 1 Cor 15:54 ("death is swallowed up in victory") and Isa 25:8. The "swallowing up" of mortality by life is the resurrection event.

**Established items:** E038 (Master E038). E037 (Master E037). Part of IB001 (FOR side of conscious intermediate state).

---

#### Revelation 6:9-11 — "Souls Under the Altar"

**Context:** The fifth seal; John sees in vision the souls of martyrs under the altar, crying out for justice.

**Direct statement (v.9-11):** "I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God... And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood... they should rest yet for a little season."

**Key observations:**
- The souls are "under the altar" — a location in a vision of the heavenly realm.
- They cry out for justice — this is described as conscious activity.
- They are told to "rest yet for a little season" — they are still awaiting final judgment.
- Genre consideration: this is apocalyptic vision language. Abel's blood "crying out" from the ground (Gen 4:10) is widely understood as figurative — the blood calling for justice, not a conscious entity speaking. The question is whether the souls under the altar are literal conscious entities or figurative representations of the martyr's cause crying out for justice.
- If this is taken literally: it supports a conscious intermediate state for the righteous dead.
- If this is taken as apocalyptic figurative language (parallel to Abel's blood): it does not.
- The text itself describes a vision — John "saw" (apocalyptic visionary language). The vision's literal correspondence to ontological reality is not established by the vision itself.

**Established items:** E051 (Master E051). Part of IB001 (FOR side; classified Ambiguous in I-B Resolution IB001).

---

#### Luke 16:19-31 — Rich Man and Lazarus

**Context:** Jesus tells a parable to the Pharisees "who were covetous" (v.14). The parable concerns a rich man and a poor beggar named Lazarus.

**Direct statements:**
- v.22-23: "the rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
- v.24-25: dialogue about torment, comfort, and memory.
- v.26: "between us and you there is a great gulf fixed."
- vv.27-31: rich man pleads for his brothers; Abraham says they have Moses and the prophets.

**Key observations:**
- This is the most detailed biblical picture of post-death consciousness — a rich man in torment, a beggar in comfort, with conversation between them.
- The literary form is a parable ("a certain rich man"), using parabolic narrative elements.
- Genre consideration: this is the only parable in Luke where a proper name is given to a character (Lazarus). Whether this makes it history rather than parable is debated.
- Several ECT proponents take this as a factual account of the intermediate state. Several conditionalists take it as a parabolic narrative using standard Jewish afterlife imagery to make a point about the use of wealth and the sufficiency of Scripture.
- The parable's primary teaching point, as stated in the text, is v.29-31: the rich man's brothers have Moses and the prophets — if they don't listen to them, they won't listen even if someone rises from the dead. The thrust of the parable is about the sufficiency of Scripture, not an eschatological description.
- The text does not identify this as a literal account of what happens after death — it is presented as Jesus's teaching, in the form of a story, to make a moral and theological point.
- Neither the conscious activity (the tormented rich man speaks and reasons) nor the comfort (Lazarus is in Abraham's bosom) can be definitively categorized as either literal description or parabolic imagery without external adjudication.

**Key observation for classification:** The Rich Man and Lazarus is not listed in the research files as a passage assigned a Master E# from etc5-01 or etc5-02. It is present in 02-verses.md and in the Nave's topic lists, but has not yet been classified in the master evidence file. It contains content supporting both the conscious intermediate state (FOR IB001) and complex features of parabolic/apocalyptic genre. It will receive a new E classification in the CONCLUSION.md.

### Section J: Death Figurative — Regeneration / Baptism

---

#### Romans 6:1-11 — "Dead to Sin"

**Context:** Paul addresses the objection that if grace abounds where sin abounded, we should sin more. He refutes this by showing that baptism is death to sin and new life.

**Direct statements:**
- v.2: "we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"
- v.9: "Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him."

**Key observations:**
- Being "dead to sin" is a figurative use of death-language — the believer's relationship to sin is one of death (separation, no longer responsive).
- v.9: Christ's resurrection means death no longer has dominion over him. This is a key statement about what resurrection accomplishes: freedom from death's dominion.
- The death-and-resurrection pattern of baptism is figurative — representing the believer's union with Christ's actual death and resurrection.

**Established items:** This passage is in Nave's DEATH entry under "Figurative of Regeneration." It is not primarily about the nature of death itself but about the spiritual dynamics of union with Christ.

## Patterns Identified

---

### Pattern 1: The Death Formula = Reversal of the Creation Formula

Gen 2:7 states the creation formula: dust + breath of God = living soul. Death reverses this:
- Dust returns to earth (Gen 3:19; Psa 104:29; Job 34:14-15 — E002, E045, E046)
- Spirit/breath returns to God (Ecc 12:7 — E012)
- Thoughts perish (Psa 146:4 — E013)
- The dead know nothing (Ecc 9:5 — E017)

This pattern is established by N004 (Master N004) and is confirmed by multiple independent authors across Genesis, Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and Job.

### Pattern 2: Three Distinct Senses of "Death" in Scripture

The gathered evidence shows Scripture uses death-language in three clearly distinguishable registers:

**(a) Physical death** — biological cessation: Gen 3:19; Ecc 12:7; Psa 146:4; Job 14:12-21. The dead sleep; they do not think, praise, or know.

**(b) Spiritual death** — the condition of the living sinner: Eph 2:1,5; Col 2:13; 1 Tim 5:6; Rom 8:6; Jhn 5:24; Matt 8:22 ("let the dead bury their dead" — first use metaphorical). The spiritually dead are biologically alive but alienated from God.

**(c) Second death / eschatological death** — the final, definitive outcome: Rev 20:14; Rev 21:8; Matt 10:28; Rev 2:11. The second death IS the lake of fire (Rev 20:14 explicitly equates them).

These three senses use the same vocabulary (thanatos/G2288; nekros/G3498; muwth/H4191; maveth/H4194) but apply to different subjects in different contexts. Context determines which sense is operative.

### Pattern 3: Death and Life as Antithetical, Not Two Modes of Existence

Throughout both testaments, death and life are consistently presented as opposites:
- Rom 6:23: wages of sin = death; gift of God = eternal life (E072)
- John 3:16: "not perish, but have everlasting life" (apollymi vs. zoe aionios)
- Ezk 18: die vs. live (die and live repeated as binary outcomes throughout)
- Rom 5:12-21: death reigned through Adam; grace reigns through Christ unto life
- John 5:24: "passed from death unto life" (not: passed from one mode of existence to another mode)
- John 5:28-29: resurrection of life vs. resurrection of damnation — both from graves
- 1 Cor 15:22: "in Adam all die; in Christ all shall be made alive" (E084)

The consistent pattern is: death = the absence or loss of life; life = its presence and continuation. The vocabulary does not treat death as a form of life or as a permanent ongoing existence separate from the body.

### Pattern 4: The Sleep Metaphor — Consistent Across Authors, Testaments, Genres

The sleep metaphor for death appears in:
- OT narrative: Deut 31:16 (God's own speech to Moses)
- OT poetry: Job 14:12 (wait in sleep until heavens no more)
- OT prophecy: Dan 12:2 (sleep in the dust of the earth)
- OT prophecy: Jer 51:39 (Babylonians sleep a perpetual sleep)
- NT Gospel: Jhn 11:11-14 (Jesus equates sleep with death; narrator confirms)
- NT Gospel: Luk 8:52 (Jesus: she sleepeth)
- NT history: Acts 7:60 (Stephen fell asleep)
- NT epistle: 1 Cor 15:6,18,20,51 (Paul consistently uses koimao for the deceased)
- NT epistle: 1 Th 4:13-15 (Paul: those who are asleep; sleep in Jesus)
- NT epistle: 2 Pet 3:4 (fathers fell asleep)

The metaphor is attested by multiple authors (Moses, Job, Daniel, Jeremiah, Jesus, Luke, Paul, Peter) across every biblical genre. From N009 (Master N009, reclassified to IA007 after Study 17): "Death is described as sleep in Jesus' own words and in Paul's consistent teaching."

The properties associated with sleep that the metaphor draws on: unconsciousness (sleep involves lack of awareness), rest, and awaiting awakening. The OT texts explicitly state what the dead do not do (think, know, praise, work — E013-E022); the sleep metaphor's properties are consistent with these explicit statements.

---

### Pattern 5: Eschatological Reversal of Death

Death is consistently framed as something to be overcome and abolished:
- 1 Cor 15:26: death = last enemy to be destroyed (E083)
- Isa 25:8: God will swallow up death in victory (E075)
- Hos 13:14: God will ransom from grave, redeem from death (E078)
- Rev 20:14: death and Hades cast into the lake of fire — death itself is destroyed
- Rev 21:4: "no more death" in the new creation (former things passed away)
- Heb 2:14: Christ destroys the power of death through his own death (E086)
- 2 Tim 1:10: Christ abolished death, brought immortality to light (E081)

Death is not a permanent feature of God's creation. It is described as an enemy, an intruder, a result of sin — and its abolition is the eschatological goal. The new creation has no death (Rev 21:4). This framing is consistent with the conditionalist position: death is real cessation of life; its abolition at the eschaton is genuine abolition (no more death, not just death transformed into something else).

### The Sin-Death-Life Chain

The Bible presents a clear causal chain across both testaments:

Gen 2:17 → (disobedience) → Gen 3:19 → (dust returns) → Rom 5:12 (death entered world by sin) → Rom 6:23 (wages = death) → Jas 1:15 (sin brings forth death) → Ezk 18:4 (soul that sins shall die)

Counter-chain: John 3:16 → (belief) → not perish → eternal life; John 5:24 (passed from death to life); Rom 6:23 (gift = eternal life); 1 John 5:11-12 (life in the Son)

The two chains are consistently parallel: sin → death; faith/repentance → life. The final expression of the death-chain is the second death (Rev 20:14; 21:8); the final expression of the life-chain is eternal life in the new creation (Rev 21:4; 22:5).

### The Three "Death" Passages of Revelation 20

Rev 20 contains three distinct death-related statements:
1. v.10: the devil, beast, and false prophet are tormented day and night in the lake of fire "for ever and ever" (eis aionas aionon).
2. v.14: death and Hades are cast into the lake of fire. "This is the second death."
3. v.15: those not written in the book of life are cast into the lake of fire.

The text explicitly identifies the second death as the lake of fire (v.14). The torment language of v.10 is applied to the devil, beast, and false prophet — not to "whosoever was not found written in the book of life" (v.15). Whether the experience of human beings in the lake of fire mirrors the experience of the devil/beast/false prophet is a cross-reference question the text does not explicitly answer in v.15. This will be examined in later studies (etc5-XX on Revelation passages).

## Word Study Insights

### H4191 (muwth) — The Certainty of "Surely Die"

In Gen 2:17, moth tamuth (infinitive absolute + imperfect) is the strongest Hebrew form of a verbal promise/warning — "dying you will die" or "you will certainly die." The intensified form conveys: (a) certainty, (b) completeness. The serpent's negation in 3:4 (lo tamuthun) uses the same construction negated — an equally emphatic denial. The narrative outcome decides between them.

---

### G622 (apollymi) — Destroy / Perish

This word appears in both John 3:16 ("not perish") and Matt 10:28 ("destroy both soul and body"). Its basic lexical meaning is "to destroy fully" or "to perish completely." It is used for the loss of an item (lost sheep, lost coin), the destruction of the body in danger (Matt 8:25: "save us, we perish"), and eschatological perishing (John 3:16). In Matt 10:28, it is applied to God's ability to destroy both soul and body — the soul is something God can completely destroy.

---

### G2288 (thanatos) — Three Senses in One Word

Paul places thanatos in direct opposition to zoe (life) in multiple passages (Rom 5:12-21; 8:6; 1 Cor 15:26). The word covers physical death, spiritual death, and the second death. This lexical range does not require the three senses to be separate realities — they may be different expressions of one reality: separation from the source of life.

---

### G2837 (koimao) — Sleep as Death

The primary NT death-euphemism. Used by Jesus (Jhn 11:11), Paul (1 Cor 15; 1 Th 4), and Luke (Acts 7:60). In its passive/reflexive use, koimao means "to slumber" figuratively. The connection between natural sleep (unconscious rest, awaiting awakening) and death is intrinsic to the metaphor's selection. If death were a state of conscious bliss or torment, "sleep" would be an ill-chosen metaphor — sleep is the universal human experience of temporary unconscious rest.

## Difficult Passages

### Luke 20:38 — "All Live unto Him"

Jesus says "he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him." This could mean: (a) the patriarchs are presently alive to God in some conscious sense; (b) God's covenantal relationship with the patriarchs implies their future resurrection — from God's perspective, they are as good as living (certainty of future resurrection). The argument Jesus is making from the burning bush is that God said "I AM the God of Abraham" (present tense at the time of Moses) — centuries after the patriarchs had died. Jesus draws the resurrection implication from this. The phrase "all live unto him" may be the basis for the argument (all are alive to God as resurrection-certain subjects) or the conclusion of the argument. The interpretation that determines whether "all live unto him" refers to present conscious existence or future resurrection-certainty requires contextual analysis beyond this study. This is noted as a passage requiring further investigation.

### The Relationship Between First Death and Second Death

Both the first death and the second death use the same word (thanatos). The second death is explicitly identified as the lake of fire (Rev 20:14; 21:8). What is the relationship?
- First death: physical cessation, universal human appointment (Heb 9:27; N018), reversible by resurrection.
- Second death: the final outcome after judgment, described with fire/destruction language; exemption is promised to overcomers (Rev 2:11); the blessed have no power of the second death over them (Rev 20:6).

The naming of both as "death" suggests a lexical-theological continuity: the second death is a "death" — but one that is final and from which there is no resurrection. "The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished" (Rev 20:5) — the first resurrection is distinct from the general resurrection unto judgment. After judgment, the second death follows for those not in the book of life (v.15). The text presents the second death as the terminus of the wicked — not as an ongoing state of torment explicitly named "death," but as a lake of fire that is identified as "death" (v.14).
