# Verse Analysis: What Does "Death" Mean in the Bible?

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Section A: Origin of Death (Genesis 2-3)

#### Genesis 2:17
**Text:** "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
**Context:** God's command to Adam in the garden, before the creation of Eve (Gen 2:18ff). This is the first occurrence of death vocabulary in Scripture.
**Direct statement:** Eating from the forbidden tree brings death. The Hebrew construction "mot tamut" (H4191 x2) is an emphatic infinitive absolute: "dying you shall die."
**Key observations:**
- The mot tamut construction is used throughout the Pentateuch for judicial death penalties (Exod 21:12,15-17; Lev 20:2ff). In those contexts, it invariably means actual physical death.
- The phrase "in the day" (beyom) raises a question: Adam did not physically die on the day he ate. He lived 930 years (Gen 5:5). Two readings emerge: (1) "in the day" is idiomatic for "when" (cf. Gen 2:4, where beyom covers the entire creation period); (2) the dying process began that day, culminating in Gen 5:5.
- The text does not define death here. It introduces death as the consequence of disobedience, with the nature of that death revealed progressively in subsequent verses.
**Cross-references:** Gen 3:3-4 (serpent's denial), Gen 3:19 (definition as return to dust), Gen 5:5 (Adam's eventual physical death), Rom 5:12 (Paul's interpretation: "by one man sin entered... and death by sin").

#### Genesis 3:3-4
**Text:** "God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die."
**Context:** The serpent's conversation with Eve.
**Direct statement:** The serpent directly contradicts God's warning. The phrase "ye shall not surely die" (lo mot temutun) negates the exact construction of Gen 2:17.
**Key observations:**
- This is the first denial of death in Scripture. God says "dying you shall die"; the serpent says "not dying you shall die."
- The text does not define what the serpent meant by denying death. The narrative proceeds to show what actually happened: expulsion from the garden and eventual physical death (Gen 3:19,22-24; 5:5).

#### Genesis 3:17-19
**Text:** "...cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; ... In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
**Context:** God's pronouncement of judgment on Adam after the fall.
**Direct statement:** Death is defined as returning to dust. The reason: man was taken from dust. This is the Bible's first explicit definition of what death means.
**Key observations:**
- "Till thou return unto the ground" establishes death as the end point of human life. The duration language ("till") shows death terminates the life described in the preceding clauses.
- "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" directly connects to Gen 2:7 ("formed man of the dust of the ground"). Death reverses creation.
- No mention of the soul departing to another realm. No mention of continued consciousness. No mention of separation from God as a definition. The definition given is physical: return to dust.
- This definition is echoed in Ecc 12:7; Ps 104:29; Job 34:14-15.

#### Genesis 3:22-24
**Text:** "And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden..."
**Context:** God's action after the fall, explaining why man was expelled from the garden.
**Direct statement:** Man was barred from the tree of life specifically to prevent him from living forever.
**Key observations:**
- The phrase "live for ever" (chay le-olam) indicates that without the tree of life, man would NOT live forever. This implies mortality is the natural result of being barred from the life source.
- If man already had an immortal soul that would live forever regardless, barring access to the tree of life would be pointless. The text presents the tree of life as necessary for continued existence.
- This passage is already registered as E006 in the master evidence file.

### Section B: Death as Reversal of Creation / Nature of Death

#### Ecclesiastes 12:7
**Text:** "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."
**Context:** The conclusion of Solomon's meditation on aging and death (Ecc 12:1-7).
**Direct statement:** At death, two things happen: dust returns to earth; spirit (ruach) returns to God.
**Key observations:**
- This is the explicit reversal of Gen 2:7: dust + breath = living soul; at death, dust returns and spirit returns. The living soul ceases.
- The text says the spirit returns to God "who gave it." This identifies ruach as God-given, not self-generating.
- The text does NOT say the spirit returns as a conscious entity. Ps 146:4 states that in "that very day his thoughts perish." The text describes a reversal of the creation formula, not a transition to a different conscious state.
- Already registered as E009.

#### Ecclesiastes 3:19-20
**Text:** "For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again."
**Context:** Solomon's observation about the shared fate of humans and animals.
**Direct statement:** Man and beast share the same breath (ruach) and the same fate: death and return to dust.
**Key observations:**
- "One breath" (ruach echad) -- the animating principle is the same for both.
- "Man hath no preeminence above a beast" -- in the matter of death, humans and animals are equal.
- "All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again" -- death is defined as returning to dust for both.
- Already registered as E008.

#### Ecclesiastes 9:5-6, 10
**Text:** (9:5-6) "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun." (9:10) "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."
**Context:** Solomon's exhortation to live fully while alive.
**Direct statement:** The dead lack knowledge, reward, memory, love, hatred, envy, work, device, knowledge, and wisdom.
**Key observations:**
- Verse 5 states the dead "know not any thing" -- total negation of cognitive activity.
- Verse 6 states love, hatred, and envy "have perished" (abad, H6) -- the same verb used for destruction/perishing elsewhere.
- Verse 10 lists four categories of activity absent in death: work, device (planning), knowledge, wisdom. This is a comprehensive negation of mental and volitional activity.
- The phrase "under the sun" appears in v.6, not v.5 or v.10. The ECT-direction inference (I002 in master) proposes that "under the sun" limits all of Ecclesiastes' death statements to earthly perspective. The text does not state this limitation.
- Already registered as E019, E020, E021.

#### Psalm 146:4
**Text:** "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish."
**Context:** A psalm warning against trusting in human princes/leaders who are mortal.
**Direct statement:** When breath (ruach) departs, the person returns to earth, and thoughts perish in that very day.
**Key observations:**
- "In that very day" -- the cessation of thought is immediate, not gradual or delayed.
- "His thoughts perish" -- eshtonot (H6250, thoughts/plans) + abad (H6, to perish/be destroyed).
- This directly contradicts any reading that the departing spirit carries consciousness. The text says thoughts perish when breath departs.
- Already registered as E011.

#### Psalm 104:29
**Text:** "Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust."
**Context:** A psalm celebrating God's providential care of all creation (animals and humans).
**Direct statement:** When God takes breath (ruach), creatures die and return to dust.
**Key observations:**
- The subject is all creatures, not just humans (the psalm discusses animals in vv.24-28).
- Death is described as God taking back what he gave: breath.
- The sequence: breath taken -> die -> return to dust.
- Already registered as E010.

#### Psalm 6:5, Psalm 115:17, Psalm 88:10-12, Psalm 30:9
**Text:** Ps 6:5: "For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?" Ps 115:17: "The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence." Ps 88:10-12: "Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? ... Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?" Ps 30:9: "What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?"
**Context:** Various psalms expressing the nature of death.
**Direct statement:** In death there is no remembrance, no praise, no thanks, no awareness of God's wonders. Death is "silence" (Ps 115:17), "the dark" (Ps 88:12), "the land of forgetfulness" (Ps 88:12).
**Key observations:**
- Four different psalms by different authors (David, Heman the Ezrahite, and others) present a consistent picture of death as silence and forgetfulness.
- These are not one author's idiosyncratic view. The consistency across authors strengthens the testimony.
- None of these texts describes death as a conscious state in another realm. All describe cessation.
- Already registered as E017, E018, E044, E045.

#### Job 14:2,5-12,14,21
**Text:** (v.10-12) "But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep." (v.14) "If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come." (v.21) "His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them."
**Context:** Job's meditation on human mortality.
**Direct statement:** After death, man does not rise until the heavens are no more. The dead do not perceive or know about events among the living.
**Key observations:**
- "Where is he?" -- the question implies the person is no longer present or locatable.
- "Lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more" -- death is likened to sleep with a terminus: the end of the present order.
- "He knoweth it not... he perceiveth it not" -- the dead lack awareness of earthly events. This is consistent with Ecc 9:5.
- Already registered as E041, E042.

#### Job 3:13-19
**Text:** "For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest... There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest."
**Context:** Job lamenting his birth, wishing he had died at birth.
**Direct statement:** Death is described as rest, quiet, sleep, cessation of trouble.
**Key observations:**
- Death is described positively in terms of what ceases: troubling, oppression, labor. This is cessation language.
- "The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master" -- death is an equalizer. All distinctions end.
- Already registered as E043.

#### Job 34:14-15
**Text:** "If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust."
**Context:** Elihu's speech to Job about God's sovereignty.
**Direct statement:** If God withdraws spirit (ruach) and breath (neshamah), all flesh perishes and returns to dust.
**Key observations:**
- Confirms that life is maintained by God's ongoing provision of ruach/neshamah.
- Death is the withdrawal of this provision.
- "All flesh shall perish" (gava, H1478 -- to expire, breathe last) -- universal application.
- Already registered as E012.

#### Isaiah 38:18-19
**Text:** "For the grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day."
**Context:** Hezekiah's prayer after recovery from illness.
**Direct statement:** The grave/death/pit cannot praise God; only the living can praise.
**Key observations:**
- The three-fold negation: grave cannot praise, death cannot celebrate, pit cannot hope.
- "The living, the living, he shall praise thee" -- the emphatic repetition contrasts the living with the dead. The dead cannot do what the living do.
- Already registered as E022.

#### James 2:26
**Text:** "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
**Context:** James' argument about faith and works.
**Direct statement:** The body without spirit (pneuma) is dead.
**Key observations:**
- This provides a NT definition of death: separation of spirit from body = death.
- This is consistent with the OT pattern: body (dust) + spirit (ruach) = life; body minus spirit = death.
- The text uses death as an analogy. The analogy works because the audience understands death as the body lacking the animating spirit.
- The text does not say the spirit that departs is conscious. It says the body without the spirit is dead.
- Already registered as E013.

### Section C: Death Entered Through Sin (NT Theological Framework)

#### Romans 5:12,14,17,21
**Text:** (5:12) "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." (5:14) "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses..." (5:17) "For if by one man's offence death reigned by one..." (5:21) "That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
**Context:** Paul's theological argument about sin, death, and grace.
**Direct statement:** Death entered the world through one man (Adam) as a result of sin. Death "passed upon" and "reigned over" all men.
**Key observations:**
- Paul uses thanatos (G2288) throughout this passage -- the same word used for physical death, spiritual death, and the second death. He does not use different vocabulary for different kinds of death.
- "Death by sin" (v.12) -- death is caused by sin. "Death reigned" (v.14,17) -- death exercised dominion.
- The contrast is death vs. eternal life (v.21): "sin hath reigned unto death... grace reign... unto eternal life." These are presented as exhaustive alternatives.
- This passage connects Gen 2:17 (the warning) to universal human experience (all die because all sin).
- Already registered as E066 (1 Cor 15:21-22 parallel).

#### Romans 6:23
**Text:** "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
**Context:** Paul's conclusion to his argument about sin and grace in Romans 6.
**Direct statement:** Sin earns death; God gives eternal life.
**Key observations:**
- "Wages" (opsonia, G3800) = earned payment. "Gift" (charisma, G5486) = free gift. The contrast: death is earned; life is given.
- The structure presents death and eternal life as exhaustive, mutually exclusive alternatives. No third option (e.g., "eternal torment") is mentioned.
- Thanatos (G2288) is used -- the same word for all types of death.
- Already registered as E087.

#### 1 Corinthians 15:21-22
**Text:** "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
**Context:** Paul's argument for the resurrection.
**Direct statement:** Death came through Adam; resurrection came through Christ. In Adam all die; in Christ all are made alive.
**Key observations:**
- The parallel structure: death/Adam vs. resurrection-life/Christ.
- "All die" -- universal. "All be made alive" -- the remedy is "being made alive," implying the dead are not alive.
- Already registered as E066.

#### 1 Corinthians 15:26
**Text:** "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."
**Context:** Paul's argument about the order of resurrection events.
**Direct statement:** Death is an enemy. It will be destroyed.
**Key observations:**
- Death is personified as an enemy (cf. Rev 6:8; 20:14).
- Death is destroyed (katargeo, G2673 -- to make entirely idle, abolish, render inoperative). The same verb is used in 2 Tim 1:10 ("abolished death").
- If death is destroyed/abolished, it ceases to operate. Already registered as E065.

#### 1 Corinthians 15:54-57
**Text:** "...Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law."
**Context:** Paul's triumphant conclusion about the resurrection.
**Direct statement:** Death is swallowed up (katapino, G2666). The sting of death is sin. Sin's strength is the law. Victory is through Christ.
**Key observations:**
- Paul quotes Isa 25:8 ("He will swallow up death in victory") and Hos 13:14 ("O death, where is thy sting?").
- "The sting of death is sin" -- death derives its power from sin. Without sin, death has no sting.
- The metaphor of a sting (kentron, G2759) portrays death as a venomous creature that is disarmed.

#### Hebrews 2:14-15
**Text:** "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
**Context:** The author of Hebrews explaining why Christ became human.
**Direct statement:** Christ died to destroy (katargeo, G2673) the one who had the power of death (the devil) and to deliver those enslaved by fear of death.
**Key observations:**
- "The power of death" (kratos tou thanatou) -- death is portrayed as a power held by the devil.
- "Fear of death" kept people in bondage. This implies death is an enemy, something to fear, not a gateway to a better existence.
- The verb katargeo is the same used in 1 Cor 15:26 (death destroyed) and 2 Tim 1:10 (death abolished).

#### Hebrews 9:27
**Text:** "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment."
**Context:** The author comparing Christ's sacrifice to the annual Day of Atonement.
**Direct statement:** Death is appointed (apokeimai, G606 -- to be reserved, laid up) for all men, followed by judgment.
**Key observations:**
- Death is universal ("appointed unto men") and singular ("once to die").
- The sequence is death, then judgment -- not death, then consciousness, then judgment.
- Already registered as E046.

#### 2 Timothy 1:10
**Text:** "But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel."
**Context:** Paul describing Christ's accomplishment.
**Direct statement:** Christ abolished (katargeo) death and revealed life and immortality through the gospel.
**Key observations:**
- Death is abolished/made inoperative. Katargeo (same word as 1 Cor 15:26 and Heb 2:14).
- Life and immortality (aphtharsia) are "brought to light" -- they are revealed, not inherent.
- Already registered as E027.

#### Isaiah 25:8
**Text:** "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces."
**Context:** Isaiah's prophecy of God's ultimate triumph.
**Direct statement:** Death will be swallowed up (bala, H1104) in victory.
**Key observations:**
- Paul quotes this in 1 Cor 15:54. The OT prophecy and NT fulfillment use the same image: death consumed, eliminated.
- Already registered as E072.

### Section D: Death as Sleep

#### Deut 31:16; Job 7:21; Job 14:12; Dan 12:2; John 11:11-14; Acts 7:60; Acts 13:36; 1 Cor 15:6,18,51; 1 Thess 4:13-16

**Collective analysis:** The sleep metaphor for death is used by Moses (Deut 31:16), Job (7:21; 14:12), Daniel (12:2), Jesus (John 11:11-14), Luke (Acts 7:60; 13:36), and Paul (1 Cor 15:6,18,51; 1 Thess 4:13-16). This is the most consistent metaphor for death in Scripture, spanning both testaments and at least seven authors.

**Key observations about the sleep metaphor:**

1. **Jesus explicitly equates sleep with death** in John 11:11-14: "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep... Howbeit Jesus spake of his death... Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead." Jesus uses "sleep" and "dead" interchangeably.

2. **Sleep implies unconsciousness.** Naturally, a sleeper is not aware of surroundings, is not active, and does not participate in events. The metaphor is consistent with the explicit statements about death: no knowledge (Ecc 9:5), no thoughts (Ps 146:4), no awareness (Job 14:21).

3. **Sleep implies future awakening.** Dan 12:2: "many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake." 1 Thess 4:16: "the dead in Christ shall rise first." The metaphor points forward to resurrection.

4. **Sleep does NOT imply continuation of consciousness.** The metaphor's entire force depends on the sleeper being unaware. If death were conscious existence in another realm, "sleep" would be a misleading metaphor.

5. Already registered as E039.

### Section E: Spiritual Death

#### Ephesians 2:1,5-6
**Text:** "And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins... Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ."
**Context:** Paul describing the believers' past condition before conversion.
**Direct statement:** Believers were "dead in trespasses and sins" before being "quickened" (made alive) with Christ.
**Key observations:**
- The same word nekros (G3498) is used for literal corpses (Matt 22:32; 1 Cor 15:35) and for the spiritually dead (Eph 2:1,5).
- "Dead in trespasses and sins" describes a present condition of those physically alive. This is death language applied metaphorically.
- The metaphor works precisely because the audience understands what death IS: cessation of life, inability to act. The spiritually dead are incapable of spiritual life, just as the physically dead are incapable of physical life.

#### Colossians 2:13
**Text:** "And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him."
**Context:** Paul describing spiritual transformation.
**Direct statement:** Same pattern as Eph 2:1 -- dead in sins, then quickened.
**Key observations:**
- Parallel to Eph 2:1,5 (same author, same vocabulary, same concept). Cross-testament parallel confirmed.

#### 1 Timothy 5:6
**Text:** "But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth."
**Context:** Paul's instructions about widows.
**Direct statement:** A person can be "dead while she liveth" -- simultaneously physically alive and spiritually dead.
**Key observations:**
- This is the clearest definition of spiritual death in the NT: one who is physically alive but spiritually dead.
- The metaphor depends on a shared understanding of what "dead" means. If "dead" meant "conscious in another realm," "dead while she liveth" would not make sense as a negative description.

#### John 5:24-26
**Text:** "He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live."
**Context:** Jesus' discourse on his authority to give life and judge.
**Direct statement:** Believers pass from death to life. The dead will hear the Son's voice and live.
**Key observations:**
- "Passed from death unto life" -- death and life are exhaustive alternatives. One passes FROM one TO the other.
- "The hour is coming, and now is" -- both present spiritual reality and future physical reality are in view.
- The same word thanatos (G2288) is used in both the spiritual sense (v.24) and the physical sense (elsewhere). No separate vocabulary.

#### Romans 8:5-6,13
**Text:** "For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace... For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die."
**Context:** Paul's contrast between flesh and Spirit.
**Direct statement:** Carnal mindedness = death. Spiritual mindedness = life and peace. Living after the flesh leads to death.
**Key observations:**
- Thanatos (G2288) describes the spiritual state of the carnally minded -- the same word used for physical death.
- The contrast is death vs. life and peace. These are presented as opposites.

#### Ephesians 4:18
**Text:** "Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart."
**Context:** Paul describing the condition of Gentiles outside of Christ.
**Direct statement:** The unsaved are "alienated from the life of God" (apallotrioo apo zoe tou theou).
**Key observations:**
- This is the closest the Bible comes to describing spiritual death as "separation from God's life." The text says they are alienated FROM the life of God, not that they are separated FROM God as a location.
- The vocabulary is alienation (relational/covenantal), not spatial separation.

#### 1 John 3:14
**Text:** "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death."
**Context:** John's test of genuine faith.
**Direct statement:** Those who love have passed from death to life. Those who do not love "abide in death."
**Key observations:**
- Same pattern as John 5:24: death -> life transition.
- "Abideth in death" (meno en thanatos) -- death is a state one remains in unless transferred to life.

#### 1 John 5:12
**Text:** "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."
**Context:** John summarizing the gospel message.
**Direct statement:** Having the Son = having life. Not having the Son = not having life.
**Key observations:**
- The binary is absolute: life or not-life. There is no third category.
- Already registered as E096.

#### Romans 7:11
**Text:** "For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me."
**Context:** Paul's autobiographical account of encountering the law.
**Direct statement:** Sin "slew" (apokteino, G615) Paul through the commandment.
**Key observations:**
- Paul was physically alive when he wrote this. The "slaying" is metaphorical/spiritual.
- The same verb used for literal killing is applied to spiritual death.

#### Luke 1:79
**Text:** "To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."
**Context:** Zechariah's prophecy about John the Baptist's mission.
**Direct statement:** People sit in "the shadow of death" (skia thanatou) and need light.
**Key observations:**
- "Shadow of death" echoes the OT tsalmaveth (Ps 23:4; Job 3:5). It describes a condition of spiritual darkness, not physical death.

#### 1 Peter 2:24
**Text:** "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness."
**Context:** Peter describing Christ's atoning work.
**Direct statement:** Believers are to be "dead to sins" and "live unto righteousness."
**Key observations:**
- "Dead to sins" -- death vocabulary used for the believer's new relationship to sin. This is the figurative/regenerative use of death language.

---

### Section F: The Second Death

#### Revelation 2:11
**Text:** "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death."
**Context:** Christ's message to the church at Smyrna.
**Direct statement:** Overcomers are exempt from the second death.
**Key observations:**
- The term "second death" (ho thanatos ho deuteros) uses thanatos -- the same word for all types of death.
- The "second" implies a first death (physical death) and a second (final) death.
- Those who overcome are "not hurt" (ou me adikeo, G91 -- not harmed/injured) by it.

#### Revelation 20:6
**Text:** "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power."
**Context:** The description of the first resurrection.
**Direct statement:** The second death has "no power" (ouk echo exousia) over those in the first resurrection.
**Key observations:**
- "No power" -- the second death is a power/authority that can or cannot be exercised over individuals.
- Participation in the first resurrection provides immunity from the second death.

#### Revelation 20:14
**Text:** "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
**Context:** The events following the great white throne judgment.
**Direct statement:** Death and hades (G86) are cast into the lake of fire. The text explicitly identifies this as "the second death."
**Key observations:**
- The text defines the second death: it IS the lake of fire (or at minimum, the casting into it).
- Death and hades are personified and destroyed -- consistent with 1 Cor 15:26 ("the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death").
- The passage does not say the second death is eternal torment. It identifies the second death with the lake of fire, then separately in Rev 20:10 describes the fate of the devil, beast, and false prophet.

#### Revelation 21:8
**Text:** "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
**Context:** The contrast between the new creation and the fate of the wicked.
**Direct statement:** The wicked "have their part in" (to meros, their portion) the lake of fire, which is the second death.
**Key observations:**
- Again, the second death is explicitly identified with the lake of fire.
- The text calls it "death" (thanatos) -- the same word used for cessation, return to dust, etc. throughout Scripture.
- The text does not define the second death as ongoing conscious torment. It calls it "death" -- the same word whose meaning has been established throughout Scripture.

#### Revelation 20:10
**Text:** "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
**Context:** The fate of the devil after the millennium.
**Direct statement:** The devil is cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and false prophet are. They are tormented day and night forever and ever.
**Key observations:**
- The subjects are the devil, the beast, and the false prophet -- not human beings.
- Tree 3 Gate 1 (Subject Gate) is relevant: are these literal human beings? The beast and false prophet are symbolic entities in Revelation's apocalyptic imagery.
- Rev 20:14-15 describes humans being cast into the lake of fire separately, and calls it "the second death" -- not "torment."
- This passage is examined in depth in later etc studies (etc-07 through etc-13). For this study, the observation is that "the second death" is the term applied to the human fate, while "tormented day and night" is applied to the devil, beast, and false prophet.

#### Matthew 25:41,46
**Text:** (v.41) "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." (v.46) "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."
**Context:** Jesus' parable of the sheep and goats.
**Direct statement:** The cursed depart into everlasting fire. They go into everlasting punishment; the righteous into life eternal.
**Key observations:**
- "Everlasting fire" was "prepared for the devil and his angels" -- not originally for humans.
- The word translated "punishment" is kolasis (G2851), which in classical Greek means corrective punishment or pruning/cutting off. The NT usage is limited (only here and 1 John 4:18).
- The contrast is "everlasting punishment" vs. "life eternal." The same adjective (aionios, G166) modifies both.
- This passage is examined in depth in later etc studies. For this study's purpose, the passage uses "punishment" and "fire" language, not "death" language directly, but Nave's classifies it under "Second Death."

#### Mark 9:43-44
**Text:** "And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
**Context:** Jesus' teaching on avoiding sin.
**Direct statement:** Gehenna has unquenchable fire and an undying worm.
**Key observations:**
- Jesus quotes Isa 66:24, which describes corpses ("carcases of the men that have transgressed"), not living people.
- "Their worm dieth not" -- in Isa 66:24, the worm feeds on dead bodies (peger, H6297 = corpse/carcass).
- This passage is examined in depth in a later etc study.

#### Ezekiel 18:4,20-24
**Text:** (v.4) "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." (v.20) "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." (v.21) "But if the wicked will turn from all his sins... he shall surely live, he shall not die." (v.23) "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?"
**Context:** God's message through Ezekiel about individual responsibility.
**Direct statement:** The sinning soul (nephesh) dies. The repentant soul lives.
**Key observations:**
- The contrast throughout is die (mut, H4191) vs. live (chayah, H2421). These are exhaustive alternatives.
- "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?" -- God's stated preference is that the wicked turn and live. The alternative to turning is death, not torment.
- Already registered as E016.

#### Other "Second Death" passages (Rom 1:32; 8:13; James 1:15; 2 Pet 2:12; 2 Thess 1:9)
These are briefly noted:
- **Rom 1:32:** Those who commit sins are "worthy of death" (thanatos).
- **Rom 8:13:** "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die" (apothnesko).
- **James 1:15:** "Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death" (thanatos).
- **2 Pet 2:12:** The wicked "shall utterly perish in their own corruption" (kataphtheiro + phthora). Already registered as E095.
- **2 Thess 1:9:** "Punished with everlasting destruction" (olethros aionios). Already registered as E090.

All these passages use death/destruction vocabulary for the final fate of the wicked. None uses "eternal torment" or "eternal conscious suffering" vocabulary. The consistent vocabulary is death, perish, destroy, corruption.

### Section G: Death Figurative of Regeneration

#### Romans 6:2-11
**Text:** "How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? ... buried with him by baptism into death... our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed..."
**Context:** Paul's argument against continuing in sin.
**Direct statement:** Believers are "dead to sin," "buried with Christ by baptism into death," with the "old man crucified."
**Key observations:**
- Death vocabulary is used metaphorically for the believer's new status in relation to sin.
- The metaphor depends on the literal meaning of death: the old self has ceased to function, no longer operates.
- "The body of sin might be destroyed (katargeo)" -- the same verb used for the destruction of death itself (1 Cor 15:26; 2 Tim 1:10; Heb 2:14).

#### Colossians 2:20
**Text:** "Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world..."
**Context:** Paul arguing against legalistic requirements.
**Direct statement:** Believers have "died with Christ" and are therefore free from worldly regulations.
**Key observations:**
- The metaphor: death = cessation of the old obligations. Being dead to something means it no longer has authority or effect.

---

### Section H: Key Additional Death Passages

#### 1 Samuel 2:6
**Text:** "The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up."
**Context:** Hannah's prayer.
**Direct statement:** God has power over both death and life. He brings down to the grave and brings up.
**Key observations:**
- "Bringeth up" (alah) -- God can reverse death. This anticipates the resurrection.
- The pair "killeth/maketh alive" uses mut (H4191) and chayah (H2421) -- the same verb pair as Ezek 18.

#### Deuteronomy 32:39
**Text:** "See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal."
**Context:** God's declaration of sovereignty.
**Direct statement:** God alone has power over life and death.

#### Psalm 89:48
**Text:** "What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?"
**Context:** A psalm of Ethan the Ezrahite.
**Direct statement:** No man can avoid death. No man can deliver his soul (nephesh) from the grave (sheol).
**Key observations:**
- Death is universal for humans.
- The soul (nephesh) goes to the grave (sheol). The nephesh is not exempt from sheol.

#### Psalm 90:3
**Text:** "Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men."
**Context:** A prayer of Moses.
**Direct statement:** God turns man to destruction (dakka, H1793 -- crushing, contrition).
**Key observations:**
- Death is described as destruction/crushing, consistent with "return to dust."

#### Hosea 13:14
**Text:** "I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction."
**Context:** God's promise through Hosea.
**Direct statement:** God will ransom from the grave and redeem from death. Death itself will be destroyed.
**Key observations:**
- Paul quotes this in 1 Cor 15:55. The OT promise is that death will be destroyed.
- "I will be thy destruction" (qatab, H6986) -- God will be death's destroyer.

#### Deuteronomy 30:15,19
**Text:** "See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil... I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life."
**Context:** Moses' final exhortation to Israel.
**Direct statement:** Life and death are presented as a binary choice, paired with good/evil and blessing/cursing.
**Key observations:**
- Life = good = blessing. Death = evil = cursing. These are exhaustive pairs.
- "Choose life" implies death is the default without choosing.

#### Revelation 1:18
**Text:** "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death."
**Context:** Christ's self-identification to John.
**Direct statement:** Christ was dead (nekros), is now alive forever, and holds the keys of hades and death.
**Key observations:**
- Christ experienced death and overcame it.
- "Keys of hell and death" -- Christ has authority over death and the grave.

#### Revelation 21:4
**Text:** "And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."
**Context:** The new creation.
**Direct statement:** In the new creation, death is eliminated.
**Key observations:**
- "No more death" -- death is not eternal. It will be eliminated.
- Consistent with 1 Cor 15:26 (death destroyed), 2 Tim 1:10 (death abolished), Rev 20:14 (death cast into lake of fire).

## Patterns Identified

1. **Death consistently defined as return to dust / cessation of life.** From Gen 3:19 through Ecc 12:7, Ps 146:4, and Ps 104:29, the definition of death is the reversal of creation: dust returns to earth, spirit returns to God, the living soul ceases.

2. **Same vocabulary for all types of death.** Hebrew uses maveth/mut and Greek uses thanatos/apothnesko for physical death, spiritual death, the second death, and figurative death. The Bible does not introduce new vocabulary for different kinds of death.

3. **Death consistently contrasted with life as exhaustive alternatives.** Deut 30:15,19; John 5:24; Rom 6:23; Gal 6:8; 1 John 5:12 all present death and life as a binary pair with no third option.

4. **Death as sleep across seven or more authors.** The sleep metaphor implies unconsciousness, rest, and future awakening (resurrection). It does not imply continued awareness.

5. **Spiritual death uses the same vocabulary as physical death.** "Dead in trespasses and sins" (Eph 2:1) uses nekros -- the same word for a corpse. The metaphor's force depends on the literal meaning of death being cessation.

6. **The "second death" is called "death."** Revelation uses thanatos for the second death. It does not introduce a new word or concept -- it applies the established meaning of death to a final event.

7. **No verse defines death as "separation of soul from body."** James 2:26 states the body without the spirit is dead, but does not say the spirit continues to live consciously apart from the body. The text defines what a dead body is, not what the spirit does after departure.

8. **No verse defines death as "separation from God."** Eph 4:18 says the unsaved are "alienated from the life of God," which describes a relational condition of the living, not a definition of death itself.

## Connections Between Passages

- **Gen 2:17 -> Gen 3:19 -> Gen 5:5:** God warns of death; defines death as return to dust; Adam dies at 930.
- **Gen 2:7 -> Ecc 12:7 -> Ps 146:4 -> Ps 104:29:** Creation formula -> reversal at death -> thoughts perish -> creatures die and return to dust.
- **Rom 5:12 -> 1 Cor 15:21-22 -> Rom 6:23:** Death entered through Adam -> by man came death -> the wages of sin is death.
- **1 Cor 15:26 -> 2 Tim 1:10 -> Heb 2:14 -> Rev 20:14 -> Rev 21:4:** Death destroyed -> death abolished -> devil's power of death destroyed -> death cast into lake of fire -> no more death.
- **Eph 2:1 -> Col 2:13 -> 1 Tim 5:6 -> John 5:24:** Dead in sins -> dead in sins -> dead while alive -> passed from death to life.

## Word Study Insights

1. **Maveth (H4194)** has 160+ occurrences spanning physical death, the state of death (hades), death as penalty for sin, and death personified. The LXX renders it as thanatos 97 times and as hades 17 times, showing the connection between death and the grave.

2. **Mut (H4191)** with 835+ occurrences covers dying, killing, and being dead. The "mot tamut" emphatic construction in Gen 2:17 is the same form used for judicial death penalties throughout the Torah.

3. **Thanatos (G2288)** with 119 occurrences covers all categories: physical death, wages of sin, Christ's death, spiritual death, the second death, and death personified. One word covers the entire semantic range.

4. **Apothnesko (G599)** with 112 occurrences covers physical dying, dying in sin, dying with Christ, and spiritual dying. Again, one word for all categories.

5. **The absence of separate vocabulary is significant.** If the Bible intended to distinguish between fundamentally different kinds of death (cessation vs. separation vs. transition to another realm), different vocabulary would be expected. Instead, the same words are used across all categories, suggesting a unified concept.

## Difficult Passages

1. **Gen 2:17 and "in the day."** Adam did not physically die on the day he ate. Possible readings: (a) "in the day" is idiomatic for "when" (cf. Gen 2:4); (b) the dying process began that day; (c) both spiritual and physical death were set in motion. The text does not resolve this. What is clear: Gen 3:19 and Gen 5:5 show that physical death was the ultimate fulfillment of the warning.

2. **Rev 20:10 and "tormented day and night."** The subjects are the devil, beast, and false prophet -- symbolic/spiritual entities, not literal human beings. The text distinguishes between their fate (tormented) and the human fate (the second death, Rev 20:14-15). This passage will be examined in depth in later etc studies.

3. **Matt 25:46 and "everlasting punishment."** The same adjective (aionios) modifies both punishment and life. The nature of the punishment is not defined in this verse; the word kolasis does not specify torment vs. destruction. This passage will be examined in depth in later etc studies.

4. **Mark 9:43-44 and "worm dieth not, fire not quenched."** Jesus quotes Isa 66:24, which describes corpses (not living people). The undying worm and unquenched fire consume the dead, not torment the living. This passage will be examined in depth in later etc studies.
