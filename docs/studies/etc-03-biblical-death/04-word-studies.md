## KEY OBSERVATIONS FROM WORD STUDIES

1. **Same vocabulary for all types of death.** Hebrew uses maveth/mut for physical death, spiritual death, and death as penalty for sin. Greek uses thanatos/apothnesko identically. The Bible does not use separate vocabulary for "spiritual death" vs. "physical death" -- the same words are used for both.

2. **Death is the opposite of life (zoe/chay).** The consistent pairing of death with life (Deut 30:15,19; John 5:24; Rom 6:23; Rom 8:6) shows death as the negation or absence of life, not as a different form of existence.

3. **LXX renders maveth as hades 17 times** and as psyche 17 times. The first shows the Jews understood death as connected to the grave/underworld. The second shows they understood that the soul (nephesh/psyche) experiences death.

4. **G2349 thnetos (mortal)** applied to human bodies in 6 passages, consistently describing humans as subject to death. The remedy is "putting on immortality" (1 Cor 15:53), not revealing inherent immortality.

5. **The "mot tamut" construction** (Gen 2:17) uses the verb H4191 twice for emphasis: "dying you shall die." The same construction appears in judicial death penalties (Exod 21:12,15-17; Lev 20:2ff) where it means actual death.
