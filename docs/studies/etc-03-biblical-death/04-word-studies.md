### H4191 — מוּת (muwth) — "To Die"

**Original:** מוּת
**Transliteration:** mûwth
**Pronunciation:** mooth
**Part of Speech:** verb (primitive root)
**BLB Count:** 835 occurrences

**Definition:**
A primitive root; to die (literally or figuratively); causatively, to kill: — at all, crying, (be) dead (body, man, one), (put to, worthy of) death, destroy(-er), (cause to, be like to, must) die, kill, necro(-mancer), must needs, slay, surely, very suddenly, in (no) wise.

**Translation Distribution (1,016 total, 306 unique):**
Major translations: died (75), die (70), surely (49), shall die (38), be put to death (33), was dead (28), dead (24), and he died (19), and died (16), is dead (15), the dead (13)

**Key Parsing Notes:**
- **Gen 2:17** — מֹ֥ות תָּמֽוּת (moth tamuth) — Infinitive Absolute + Qal Imperfect 2ms = "dying you will die" / "you will surely die." The doubling of the verb root with the infinitive absolute intensifies certainty: "certainly/surely die."
- **Ezk 18:4** — הַחֹטֵ֖את הִ֥יא תָמֽוּת (hachote'at hi tamuth) — Qal Participle + Personal pronoun + Qal Imperfect 3fs = "the one who sins — she [herself] shall die." The pronoun is emphatic.
- **Ezk 18:20** — same construction: "the soul that sinneth, it shall die"
- **Ezk 18:21-28** — the verb muwth appears in contrast with "he shall live, he shall not die" (chayah vs. muwth)

**LXX Mapping Note:** H4191 is most commonly translated in the LXX as ἀποθνήσκω (apothnesko, G599) for the basic "die" sense, and θανατόω (thanatoo, G2289) for "put to death."

### H5315 — נֶפֶשׁ (nephesh) — "Soul / Life / Person"

**Original:** נֶפֶשׁ
**Transliteration:** nephesh
**Pronunciation:** neh-fesh
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 753 occurrences

**Definition:**
Properly, a breathing creature, i.e. animal of (abstractly) vitality; used very widely in a literal, accommodated or figurative sense (bodily or mental): — any, appetite, beast, body, breath, creature, dead(-ly), desire, (dis-) contented, fish, ghost, greedy, he, heart(-y), (hath, jeopardy of) life (in jeopardy), lust, man, me, mind, mortally, one, own, person, pleasure, (her-, him-, my-, thy-) self, them (your) -selves, slay, soul, tablet, they, thing, (she) will, would have it.

**Translation Distribution (780 occurrences):**
- "my soul" — 95 (12.2%), "soul" — 43, "thy soul" — 42, "his soul" — 36, "the souls" — 27, "my life" — 20, "his life" — 16, "creature" — 9, "person" — 8, "body" — 4, "dead" — 2, etc.

**Significance for Death Study:**
- **Gen 2:7** — "man became a living nephesh" — man IS a nephesh (soul), not HAS one
- **Ezk 18:4, 20** — "the nephesh that sinneth, it shall die" — nephesh is the grammatical subject of dying
- **Lev 17:11** — "the life (nephesh) of the flesh is in the blood"
- **Gen 35:18** — "And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died)..." — shows nephesh can "depart" at death
- **1 Kings 17:21-22** — "let this child's nephesh come into him again... the nephesh of the child came into him again" — the soul can "return"
- **Ecc 9:5** — the dead know nothing — the nephesh is not described as continuing conscious existence after death

### H7307 — רוּחַ (ruach) — "Wind / Breath / Spirit"

**Original:** רוּחַ
**Transliteration:** rûwach
**Pronunciation:** roo-akh
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 378 occurrences

**Definition:**
From [H7306]; wind; by resemblance breath, i.e. a sensible (or even violent) exhalation; figuratively, life, anger, unsubstantiality; by extension, a region of the sky; by resemblance spirit, but only of a rational being (including its expression and functions): — air, anger, blast, breath, cool, courage, mind, quarter, side, spirit(-ual), tempest, vain, (whirl-)wind(-y).

**Translation Distribution (434 occurrences):**
- "the spirit" — 53, "spirit" — 39, "wind" — 30, "the wind" — 26, "the Spirit" — 22, "my spirit" — 20, "breath" — 8, "winds" — 8, etc.

**Significance for Death Study:**
- **Ecc 12:7** — "the spirit (ruach) shall return unto God who gave it" — at death, the breath-spirit returns to God
- **Psalm 146:4** — "His breath (ruach) goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish"
- **Psalm 104:29** — "thou takest away their breath (ruach), they die"
- **Job 34:14** — "If he gather unto himself his spirit (ruach) and his breath"
- **Ecc 3:21** — "Who knoweth the spirit (ruach) of man that goeth upward, and the spirit (ruach) of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?"
- **Isaiah 26:9** — "With my soul (nephesh) have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit (ruach) within me will I seek thee"

**Key Note:** In Psalm 146:4 and Ecc 12:7, ruach is parallel to the "dust" that returns to earth. The ruach "returns to God" — not as an independently living entity but as the animating breath/life-force that God originally gave. The context of Psalm 146:4 specifies that on that very day "his thoughts perish" — the ruach's departure is not described as conscious survival.

**Key Theological Notes:**
- Used 120x in NT; death is personified as an enemy (1 Cor 15:26; Rev 6:8)
- G2288 covers physical death (Rom 5:12), spiritual death (Rom 8:6), and the second death (Rev 2:11; 20:14)
- Paul places θάνατος in direct opposition to ζωή (life, G2222) — they are antithetical, not two modes of existence
- Rev 20:14 — "death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death" — death itself is destroyed

**Parsing notes for key verses:**
- **1 Cor 15:26** — ἔσχατος ἐχθρὸς καταργεῖται ὁ θάνατος — "The last enemy being abolished is death" — Present Passive Indicative (katageitai) indicates an ongoing process reaching its eschatological completion; death is the subject (nominative singular masculine)
- **Rev 20:14** — ὁ θάνατος (nominative) + ὁ Ἅιδης — both subjects of "were cast" (aorist passive); then οὗτος ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός ἐστιν — "this [second] death is" — predicative identification
- **Rom 6:23** — θάνατος [nominative] as predicate — "the wages of sin IS death" (no verb "is" in Greek; pure nominal sentence)

**Critical Note — Matt 10:28:**
"fear him which is able to destroy (apollymi) both soul and body in hell (Gehenna)" — G622 apollymi indicates complete destruction; the word is applied to BOTH soul and body. This is the central verse for the "annihilation" argument.

**John 3:16:**
"whosoever believeth in him should not perish (apollymi), but have everlasting life" — the contrast is: perish vs. eternal life.

### G2837 — κοιμάω (koimao) — "To Sleep / Fall Asleep (euphemism for death)"

**Original:** κοιμάω
**Transliteration:** koimáō
**Pronunciation:** koy-mah-o
**Part of Speech:** verb
**BLB Count:** 18 occurrences

**Definition:**
From [G2749 keimai]; to put to sleep, i.e. (passively or reflexively) to slumber; figuratively, to decease: — (be a-, fall a-, fall on) sleep, be dead.

**Translation Distribution (17 occurrences):**
- "sleep" — 3 (17.6%)
- "slept" — 2 (11.8%)
- "sleeping" — 2 (11.8%)
- "are fallen asleep" — 2 (11.8%)
- "are asleep" — 2 (11.8%)
- Other: "he fell asleep," "fell on sleep," "be dead," "that slept," "We shall," "fell asleep"

**Key Occurrences:**
1 Kings 2; 11:43; Isa 14:8; 43:17; Matt 27:52; 28:13; Luke 22:45; John 11:11, 12; Acts 7:60; 12:6; 13:36; 1 Cor 7:39; 11:30; 15:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 Thess 4:13, 14, 15; 2 Pet 3:4

**Critical Analysis:**
- G2837 is the primary NT word for death as sleep. All major NT teachers use it:
  - Jesus: **John 11:11** — "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth (kekoimētai)"
  - Paul: **1 Cor 15:6** — "some are fallen asleep (ekoimēthēsan)"; v.18 — "fallen asleep in Christ"; v.20 — "firstfruits of them that slept (kekoimēmenōn)"; v.51 — "we shall not all sleep (koimēthēsometha)"
  - Paul: **1 Thess 4:13, 14, 15** — "them which are asleep (koimōmenōn)"; "which sleep in Jesus (koimēthentas)"; "which are asleep (kekoimēmenous)"
  - Luke: **Acts 7:60** — Stephen "fell asleep (ekoimēthē)"
  - Peter: **2 Pet 3:4** — "since the fathers fell asleep (ekoimēthēsan)"
- The metaphor: sleep implies unconsciousness and awakening. The dead are "asleep" awaiting resurrection — consistent with the OT data showing the dead have no consciousness, thought, praise, or activity.

### G110 — ἀθανασία (athanasia) — "Immortality"

**Original:** ἀθανασία
**Transliteration:** athanasía
**Pronunciation:** ath-an-as-ee-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 3 occurrences

**Definition:**
From a compound of [G1 a] (as a negative particle) and [G2288 thanatos]; deathlessness: — immortality.

**Translation Distribution (3 occurrences):**
- "immortality" — 3 (100%)

**Occurrences:**
1 Corinthians 15:53, 54 and 1 Timothy 6:16

**Critical Analysis:**
- **1 Cor 15:53-54** — "this mortal [must] put on immortality (athanasian)... this mortal shall have put on immortality (athanasian)" — athanasia is something the mortal body PUTS ON at the resurrection; it is not a current possession
- **1 Tim 6:16** — "Who only (monos) hath immortality (athanasian)" — God ALONE currently possesses athanasia. The word monos is absolute: no other being currently has it. This directly states that no present human has immortality.
- Together, these three occurrences establish: God currently has immortality; humans receive it at resurrection by "putting it on." Therefore, human immortality is not innate but eschatological.

### G861 — ἀφθαρσία (aphtharsia) — "Incorruption / Immortality"

**Original:** ἀφθαρσία
**Transliteration:** aphtharsía
**Pronunciation:** af-thar-see-ah

**Key Occurrences:**
Romans 2:7; 1 Corinthians 15:42; Ephesians 6:24; 2 Timothy 1:10; Titus 2:7

**Critical Notes:**

## LXX Connection Notes

The LXX (Septuagint) provides the lexical bridge between OT Hebrew death vocabulary and NT Greek death vocabulary:

- **H4191 (muwth)** → LXX uses primarily ἀποθνήσκω (G599) for simple "die" and θανατόω (G2289) for "put to death"
- **H4194 (maveth)** → LXX translates as θάνατος (G2288)
- **H5315 (nephesh)** → LXX translates as ψυχή (psyche, G5590)
- **H7307 (ruach)** → LXX translates as πνεῦμα (pneuma, G4151)
- **Hosea 13:14** (Hebrew: maveth... sheol) → Paul quotes this in 1 Cor 15:55 ("O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?") using G2288 (thanatos) and G86 (Hades)
- **Isaiah 25:8** (Hebrew: billa hammavet lanesach = "He will swallow up death forever") → Paul quotes in 1 Cor 15:54 ("Death is swallowed up in victory") using G2288

Note: The LXX --lxx-map function was unavailable (SQLite log function error) for automated output, but the above connections are derivable from the Strong's lexicon cross-references and parallel data.
