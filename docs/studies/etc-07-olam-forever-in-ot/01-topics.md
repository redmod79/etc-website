## Question

What does the Hebrew word olam (H5769) mean in the Old Testament? Does it always mean "eternal/endless" or can it mean "age-long/pertaining to an age"? Examine key uses: in punishment contexts, creation contexts, covenant contexts, and descriptive contexts where the duration is clearly limited. Does the OT use of olam in punishment contexts require endless conscious torment?

### ETERNITY

Entry from Nave's Topical Bible:

```
=== [E] ETERNITY ===
  -God inhabits ISA 57:15; MIC 5:2
  -God rules JER 10:10
  -See GOD, ETERNITY OF
  -UNCLASSIFIED SCRIPTURES RELATING TO PSA 30:12; 41:13; 72:17; 90:2; 110:4; 119:142;
   MAT 6:13; 18:8; 2CO 9:9; Jude 1:6
  -See LIFE, EVERLASTING
  -See PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL
```

**Notes:** Nave's ETERNITY entry directs to PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL and LIFE, EVERLASTING. Key OT verses under this entry are Psalms. God "inhabiting eternity" (Isa 57:15) uses H5703 (ad), not H5769 (olam).

### EVERLASTING LIFE / ETERNAL LIFE

Entry from Nave's Topical Bible:

```
=== [E] EVERLASTING LIFE ===
  -See LIFE, EVERLASTING

=== [E] ETERNAL LIFE ===
  -See LIFE EVERLASTING
```

**Notes:** Both redirect to LIFE, EVERLASTING. The Nave's IMMORTALITY entry contains the substantive content (see below).

### IMMORTALITY

Entry from Nave's Topical Bible (full entry):

```
=== [I] IMMORTALITY ===
  -General scriptures concerning GEN 5:24; 2SA 12:23; 2KI 2:11; NEH 9:5; JOB 4:17-21;
   14:13; PSA 16:10,11; 21:4; 22:26; 23:6; 31:5; 36:9; 37:18,27; 49:7-9,14,15; 73:26;
   86:12; 102:4,25-28; 121:8; 133:3; 145:1,2; PRO 14:32; ECC 3:21; 12:7; ISA 14:9; 25:8;

   12:26,27; LUK 9:25; 10:25-28; 20:36-38; JHN 3:14-16,36; 5:39,40; 6:39,40,44,47,50,51,
   53,54,58; 10:28; 11:25,26; 14:19; 17:2,3; ACT 20:32; 23:8,9; 26:7,8,18; ROM 2:7;

   1PE 1:3-5; 1JN 2:17,25; 5:13; Jude 1:21; REV 1:7; 3:4; 22:5
  -See RESURRECTION
  -See RIGHTEOUS, PROMISES TO
  -See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF
```

**Notes:** DAN 12:2,3 is listed under IMMORTALITY, covering both the resurrection to life and the resurrection to contempt — Nave's treats both outcomes under this heading. Key OT passages: Isa 26:19 (resurrection), Dan 12:2-3 (the resurrection text with olam). The "See RESURRECTION" and "See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF" cross-references point to the two poles of Dan 12:2.

### PUNISHMENT (ETERNAL sub-entry)

Entry from Nave's Topical Bible:

```
=== [P] PUNISHMENT ===
  [Selected portions — full entry also covers DEATH PENALTY, MINOR OFFENSES, etc.]

  -ETERNAL ISA 34:8-10; DAN 12:2; MAT 3:12; 10:28; 18:8; 25:41,46; MRK 3:29; LUK 3:17;
   JHN 5:29; HEB 6:2; 10:28-31; REV 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10
  -See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF
```

**Notes:** Nave's PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL sub-entry cites only two OT texts: ISA 34:8-10 and DAN 12:2. These are the two primary OT "eternal punishment" proof texts. All other citations under this entry are NT (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Hebrews, Revelation). This is significant: in the OT, Nave's finds only Isa 34:8-10 and Dan 12:2 for this category.

### EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT

Entry from Nave's Topical Bible:

```
=== [E] EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT ===
  -See PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL
```

**Notes:** Pure redirect; no independent entry.

### FIRE (EVERLASTING FIRE sub-entry)

Entry from Nave's Topical Bible:

```
=== [F] FIRE ===
  [Selected portion]
  -FIGURATIVE
     -Judgments DEU 4:24; 32:22; ISA 33:14; JER 23:29; AMO 1:4,7,10,12,14; 2:2;
      MAL 3:2; LUK 12:49; REV 20:9
     -Of the destruction of the wicked MAT 13:42,50; 25:41; MRK 9:44; REV 9:2; 21:8
     -EVERLASTING FIRE ISA 33:14; MAT 18:8; 25:41; MRK 9:44
```

**Notes:** The only OT text cited under EVERLASTING FIRE is ISA 33:14. The three NT texts are Matthew 18:8, Matthew 25:41, and Mark 9:44. Notably, Isa 33:14 describes "everlasting burnings" as a description of God's holy presence (the context is who among us can dwell with this God — answered positively in vv.15-16), not a punishment for the wicked.

## Related Topics Discovered During Research

### ETERNITY — God's Attribute

- Isa 57:15: "the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity" — uses H5703 (ad), not H5769 (olam)
- The specific Hebrew word in this verse is ad (perpetuity/terminus), distinguishable from olam

### GOD, ETERNITY OF

- Nave's search returned no distinct entry for "GOD, ETERNITY OF" as a separate topic
- The ETERNITY entry directs there but the cross-reference is not developed independently in Nave's

### Key observation on Nave's scope

The PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL entry in Nave's is dominated by NT references. The two OT entries are:
1. **Isa 34:8-10** — Edom judgment: "the year of recompences... smoke ascendeth for ever"
2. **Dan 12:2** — Resurrection text: "everlasting life... everlasting contempt"

Both use H5769 (olam). The analysis agent should compare these two olam uses with the Category A limited-duration olam passages to determine what olam means in judgment contexts.
