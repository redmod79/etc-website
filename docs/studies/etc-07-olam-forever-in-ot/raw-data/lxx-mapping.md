## Key Mapping Analysis

### The H5769 → G165/G166 Bridge

The LXX (Septuagint) translated H5769 (olam) into Greek as:
- G165 (aion): 287 times — the noun form "age/ages"
- G166 (aionios): 100 times — the adjective form "age-long/eternal"

PMI (Pointwise Mutual Information) scores:
- G165: PMI = 5.55 — very strong association (not coincidental)
- G166: PMI = 5.67 — slightly stronger association by PMI, though fewer raw occurrences

**The PMI-weighted scores confirm G165 and G166 are the dominant, non-accidental translations of
H5769.** All other Greek words (G1074 γενεά "generation," G1656 ἔλεος "mercy," etc.) represent
contextual/thematic translations rather than semantic equivalents.

### Implication for NT Interpretation

When NT authors use G165 (aion) or G166 (aionios), readers who knew the LXX would understand
these words through the lens of H5769 (olam). This means:

1. **G166 aionios ("eternal") carries olam's semantic range** — which includes age-long,
   age-pertaining, and genuinely endless uses depending on context.

2. **Dan 12:2 LXX uses G166 (aionios) for both outcomes**: "everlasting life" (zoe aionios)
   and "everlasting contempt" (aischyne aionios). Both translate H5769 olam. The NT phrase
   "eternal life" (zoe aionios) and "eternal punishment" (kolasis aionios) in Matt 25:46
   carry the same word with the same semantic history.

3. **The symmetry of Matt 25:46** parallels the symmetry of Dan 12:2 — same word (aionios),
   same construction (some to X aionios, some to Y aionios). If aionios must mean absolutely
   endless for the punishment, it must mean the same for the life, and vice versa.

4. **G166 (aionios) definition in lexicons explicitly notes**: "also used of past time, or past
   and future as well" — confirming the word inherits olam's bidirectionality (not just endless
   future, but also referring to what is ancient/past-age).

### G165 Multiple KJV Renderings

The KJV translators rendered G165 as "world" (30 times) in addition to "ever" (42 times).
Examples:
- "the end of the world" (Matt 13:39) = "the end of the age" (sunteleia tou aionos)
- "this world" vs "the world to come" = "this age" vs "the coming age"
- "before the world began" (2 Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2) = "before the ages began"

This shows that even NT aion frequently means "age" in a limited, era-defining sense — not
necessarily "eternity" in the philosophical absolute sense.

### G166 Definition Note

The Thayer/BDB definition of G166 explicitly includes "past time" — so aionios can describe
what pertains to a past age. Example: "eternal redemption" (Heb 9:12, apolutrosin aionion)
= redemption that belongs to the coming age, accomplished once and valid permanently. The
"eternal" quality refers to the age to which it belongs and its lasting effect, not the duration
of an ongoing redemptive act.

## Summary Table

| Hebrew | Greek LXX | Count | PMI  | Relation
|--------|-----------|-------|------|-------------------------------------------
| H5769  | G165 aion | 287x  | 5.55 | Primary translation — noun "age"
| H5769  | G166 aionios | 100x | 5.67 | Secondary translation — adjective "age-long"
| G165   | —         | —     | —    | NT: 38.5% "ever," 27.5% "world," 18.3% "and ever"
| G166   | —         | —     | —    | NT: 39.6% "eternal," 27.1% "everlasting," 14.6% "of eternal"

The H5769→G165/G166 mapping is the critical bridge between OT olam and NT aionios. The analysis
of what olam means in OT judgment texts directly governs what aionios means in NT parallel texts.
