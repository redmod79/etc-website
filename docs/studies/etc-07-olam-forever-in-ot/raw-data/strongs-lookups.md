### Lexicon Entry
- **Transliteration**: ʻôwlâm
- **Pronunciation**: o-lawm
- **Part of Speech**: masculine noun (n-m)
- **BLB Count**: 439
- **Definition**: or עֹלָם ʻôlâm; from; properly, concealed, i.e. the vanishing point; generally, time out of mind (past or future), i.e. (practically) eternity; frequentatively, adverbial (especially with prepositional prefix) always: — alway(-s), ancient (time), any more, continuance, eternal, (for, (n-)) ever(-lasting, -more, of old), lasting, long (time), (of) old (time), perpetual, at any time, (beginning of the) world (without end).

**KEY NOTE**: The root meaning is "concealed" — referring to the vanishing point of time, time beyond the horizon of sight. This inherently indicates indefiniteness rather than mathematical infinity.

### LXX Mapping (Greek translations)
Top translations in the Septuagint:
1. **G165 αἰών (aion)** — count: 287, PMI: 5.55 — "an age; by extension, perpetuity"
2. **G166 αἰώνιος (aionios)** — count: 100, PMI: 5.67 — "perpetual (also used of past time)"
3. **G1074 γενεά (genea)** — count: 51, PMI: 4.37 — "a generation"
4. **G3545 νομίμως (nomimos)** — count: 30, PMI: 4.96 — "legitimately"
5. **G1656 ἔλεος (eleos)** — count: 57, PMI: 3.85 — "compassion"
6. **G1519 εἰς (eis)** — count: 255, PMI: 1.73 — "to, into"
7. **G1242 διαθήκη (diatheke)** — count: 30, PMI: 2.62 — "a covenant, disposition"

**KEY OBSERVATION**: The LXX primarily translates olam with aion (287x) and aionios (100x), both of which carry the same semantic ambiguity — "age" or "age-lasting" rather than strictly "eternal." The 51 translations as "generation" confirm the finite-duration sense.

**KEY NOTE**: The root meaning includes "terminus" (endpoint), suggesting duration advancing toward a goal rather than absolute endlessness.

### LXX Mapping
1. **G165 αἰών (aion)** — count: 33, PMI: 5.57
2. **G3306 μένω (meno)** — count: 4, PMI: 5.30 — "to stay, remain"

## H5331: netsach (נֶצַח)

### Lookup Summary

- **Top translations**:
  - "for ever" — 21 (47.7%)
  - "perpetual" — 3 (6.8%)
  - "never" — 3 (6.8%)
  - "always" — 2 (4.5%)

### Lexicon Entry
- **Transliteration**: netsach
- **Pronunciation**: neh-tsakh
- **Part of Speech**: masculine noun (n-m)
- **BLB Count**: 43
- **Definition**: or נֵצַח nêtsach; from; properly, a goal, i.e. the bright object at a distance travelled towards; hence (figuratively), splendor, or (subjectively) truthfulness, or (objectively) confidence; but usually (adverbially), continually (i.e. to the most distant point of view): — alway(-s), constantly, end, (n-) ever(more), perpetual, strength, victory.

**KEY NOTE**: Root meaning is "a goal" — the bright object at a distance. This is explicitly about perspective and distance, not mathematical infinity. "To the most distant point of view" = as far as one can see.

### LXX Mapping
1. **G5056 τέλος (telos)** — count: 19, PMI: 6.41 — "an end, goal"
2. **G4219 πότε (pote)** — count: 5, PMI: 6.22 — "when?"
3. **G165 αἰών (aion)** — count: 10, PMI: 4.05
4. **G1950 ἐπιλανθάνομαι (epilanthanomai)** — count: 5, PMI: 4.89 — "to forget"
5. **G622 ἀπόλλυμι (apollymi)** — count: 6, PMI: 3.73 — "to destroy fully"

**KEY OBSERVATION**: The LXX most frequently translates netsach as telos ("end/goal"), reinforcing the "goal/endpoint" rather than "endlessness" semantics.

### Lexicon Entry
- **Transliteration**: tâmîyd
- **Pronunciation**: taw-meed
- **Part of Speech**: masculine noun (n-m)
- **BLB Count**: 104
- **Definition**: from an unused root meaning to stretch; properly, continuance (as indefinite extension); but used only (attributively as adjective) constant (or adverbially, constantly); elliptically the regular (daily) sacrifice: — alway(-s), continual (employment, -ly), daily, (n-)ever(-more), perpetual.

**KEY NOTE**: Most commonly used for the daily/continual sacrifice, not for ontological eternity. The root means "to stretch" — indefinite extension, not absolute endlessness.

### LXX Mapping
1. **G1223 διά (dia)** — count: 84, PMI: 4.43 — "through, by means of"
2. **G2378 θυσία (thysia)** — count: 19, PMI: 3.86 — "sacrifice"

4. **G3956 πᾶς (pas)** — count: 87, PMI: 2.25 — "all, every"

**KEY OBSERVATION**: The overwhelming association with sacrifice/offering confirms tamid as a liturgical/temporal term, not an ontological eternity term.

## H5957: alam (עָלַם) — Aramaic

### Lookup Summary
- **Total occurrences**: 20
- **Top translations**:
  - "for ever" — 8 (40.0%)
  - "ever" — 4 (20.0%)
  - "everlasting" — 4 (20.0%)
  - "old" — 2 (10.0%)
  - "never" — 1 (5.0%)
  - "and ever" — 1 (5.0%)

### Lexicon Entry
- **Transliteration**: ʻâlam
- **Pronunciation**: aw-lam
- **Part of Speech**: masculine noun (n-m)
- **BLB Count**: 20
- **Definition**: (Aramaic) corresponding to; remote time, i.e. the future or past indefinitely; often adverb, forever: — for (n-)ever (lasting), old.

**KEY NOTE**: The Aramaic form directly corresponds to Hebrew olam and carries the same semantic range — "remote time" past or future, "indefinitely." Used primarily in Daniel.

### Key Occurrences in Daniel
- Dan 2:4 — "O king, live for ever" (courtly greeting)
- Dan 2:20 — "from age to age" (min-alam ve-ad-alam)
- Dan 2:44 — kingdom that shall "never be destroyed... stand for ever"
- Dan 3:9; 5:10; 6:6,21,26 — "live for ever" (courtly greeting)
- Dan 4:3,34 — "everlasting kingdom/dominion"
- Dan 7:14,18,27 — "everlasting dominion" / saints possess kingdom "for ever"
- Ezra 4:15,19 — "of old" (past time reference)

**KEY OBSERVATION**: The courtly greeting "O king, live forever" is never understood literally — the king will die. This confirms the non-literal, contextual nature of the term even in Aramaic usage.
