## Dan 12:2 — Pericope Context

```
# Daniel 12:2

> And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and
> some to shame [and] everlasting contempt.

Testament: OT | Author: Daniel | Words: 25

## Immediate Context (Pericope)

Range: Daniel 12:1 — Daniel 12:3 (3 verses)

 12:1  And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children
       of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a
       nation [even] to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one
       that shall be found written in the book.
>>12:2  And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life,
       and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt.
 12:3  And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many
       to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
```

**Study notes:**
- Dan 12:2 uses H5769 (olam) twice, symmetrically: "everlasting life" (chayye olam) and "everlasting
  contempt" (dir'on olam). The parallelism is exact — the same word modifies both outcomes.
- Dan 12:3 adds a third olam: "for ever and ever" (le-olam wa-ed) — describing the glory of the wise.
- The pericope is bracketed by Michael standing up (12:1) and the resurrection/judgment (12:2-3).
- H1860 (dir'on = "contempt/abhorrence") occurs only here and in Isa 66:24 in the OT.
- The verb יָקִיצוּ (yaqitsu, "shall awake/arise") in Dan 12:2 is the same root as לֹא יָקִיצוּ
  ("not awake") in Jer 51:57 (perpetual sleep of Babylon's rulers). The contrast is deliberate.

## Isa 34:10 — Pericope and Chapter Context

```
# Isaiah 34:10

> It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation
> to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.

Testament: OT | Author: Isaiah | Words: 33

## Chapter Context

Isaiah 34 — 17 verses, 522 words
Theme: Universal judgment and future glory
Sections:
  - Isaiah 34:1 — Isaiah 34:3
  - Isaiah 34:4 — Isaiah 34:6
  - Isaiah 34:7 — Isaiah 34:10
  - Isaiah 34:11 — Isaiah 34:16
  - Isaiah 34:17 — Isaiah 34:17

## Immediate Context (Pericope): Isaiah 34:7 — Isaiah 34:10 (4 verses)

 34:7  And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land
       shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
 34:8  For [it is] the day of the LORD'S vengeance, [and] the year of recompences for the
       controversy of Zion.
 34:9  And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone,
       and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
>>34:10 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from
       generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
```

**Study notes:**
- The subject is Edom (vv. 5-6 name Edom explicitly). The judgment uses Sodom-and-Gomorrah imagery
  (pitch, brimstone — Gen 19 language) applied to a specific nation.
- "From generation to generation it shall lie waste" — desolation language, not conscious torment.
  The land becomes uninhabited, a lasting ruin.
- "Smoke thereof shall go up for ever" (le-olam) — compare Sodom: "smoke of the country went up
  as the smoke of a furnace" (Gen 19:28). Sodom is today a physical archaeological site, not
  still burning. The smoke-ascending language is judgment rhetoric.
- "For ever and ever" (le-netsach netsachim) uses H5331, not olam. Two words for perpetuity.
- Isa 34:11-17 describes the land as a habitation of pelicans, bitterns, owls, ravens — wildlife
  taking over the desolate land. This is compatible with physical ruin, not ongoing fire.
- Rev 14:11 quotes this language: "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever."
  The source text (Isa 34:10) describes an ended physical conflagration whose smoke testifies to
  total destruction, not ongoing burning.

## Hab 3:6 — Pericope Context

```
# Habakkuk 3:6

> He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting
> mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways [are] everlasting.

Testament: OT | Author: Minor_Prophets | Words: 28

## Immediate Context (Pericope): Habakkuk 3:4 — Habakkuk 3:18 (15 verses)

 3:4   And [his] brightness was as the light; he had horns [coming] out of his hand: and there
       [was] the hiding of his power.
 3:5   Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.
>>3:6  He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting
       mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways [are] everlasting.
 3:7   I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: [and] the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
 3:8   Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? [was] thine anger against the rivers? [was] thy
       wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses [and] thy chariots of salvation?
 [continues through 3:18]
```

**Study notes:**
- Hab 3:6 is the single most important verse for the semantic range of olam, containing three
  temporal terms in one sentence:
  1. H5703 (ad): "everlasting mountains" — scattered by God's theophany
  2. H5769 (olam): "perpetual hills" — bowed down when God appeared
  3. H5769 (olam): "his ways are everlasting" — God's character endures
- Items (1) and (2) refer to the mountains and hills, which by definition are ancient and seemingly
  permanent but are "scattered" and "bow" before God. The word "everlasting" (ad/olam) in these
  phrases describes age-old antiquity, not endless duration forward.
- Item (3) uses olam for God's ways — clearly genuinely endless.
- Same word (olam, or near-cognate ad) used in the same verse for both "temporary-seeming permanence"
  (mountains) and "true perpetuity" (God's ways). Context determines meaning.

## Exo 21:6 — Pericope Context

```
# Exodus 21:6

> Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the
> door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.

Testament: OT | Author: Moses | Words: 40

## Immediate Context (Pericope): Exodus 21:5 — Exodus 21:8 (4 verses)

 21:5  And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not
       go out free:
>>21:6  Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or
       unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve
       him for ever.
 21:7  And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.
 21:8  If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be
       redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt
       deceitfully with her.
```

**Study notes:**
- "Serve him for ever" (le-olam): The servant serves for the rest of his life, not literally for
  all eternity. Death ends the service. This is a Category A (limited duration) olam use.
- The parallel in Deut 15:17 uses the same construction for the same law.
- This is a definitive proof that olam can mean "for the duration of a lifetime" / "as long as he
  lives" — clearly not endless. The context (mortal human master-servant relationship) sets the limit.

## Jon 2:6 — Pericope Context

```
# Jonah 2:6

> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars [was] about me for ever: yet
> hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.

Testament: OT | Author: Minor_Prophets | Words: 32

## Immediate Context (Pericope): Jonah 2:4 — Jonah 2:8 (5 verses)

 2:4   Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
 2:5   The waters compassed me about, [even] to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the
       weeds were wrapped about my head.
>>2:6  I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars [was] about me for ever:
       yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.
 2:7   When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into
       thine holy temple.
 2:8   They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
```

**Study notes:**
- "For ever" (le-olam): Jonah describes his experience in the fish's belly as being imprisoned
  "for ever" — yet the very next clause says "yet hast thou brought up my life." The olam was
  ended by God's intervention. Jonah was down there for three days (1:17), not eternity.
- This is a Category A (limited duration) olam use — expressing the subjective sense of endless-
  ness during a finite imprisonment, not actual eternal duration.
- Note on BHSA verse numbering: KJV Jonah 2:6 corresponds to a slightly different verse boundary
  in the BHSA Hebrew text. Hebrew parsing confirmed the "for ever" (le-olam) phrase appears in
  the verse identified as Jon 2:7 in BHSA.

## Gen 6:3 — Pericope Context

```
# Genesis 6:3

> And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also [is] flesh: yet
> his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

Testament: OT | Author: Moses | Words: 28

## Immediate Context (Pericope): Genesis 6:1 — Genesis 6:4 (4 verses)

 6:1   And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were
       born unto them,
 6:2   That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they [were] fair; and they took them wives
       of all which they chose.
>>6:3  And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also [is] flesh:
       yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
 6:4   There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came
       in unto the daughters of men, and they bare [children] to them, the same [became] mighty men
       which [were] of old, men of renown.
```

**Study notes:**
- "Not always" (lo le-olam): KJV renders the negative-olam construction as "not always." God's
  spirit will not strive with man forever — the announcement of a temporal limit.
- This is a Category A (limited duration) olam: here, the olam is specifically negated.
  Even used with negation, the construction shows olam's built-in contextual flexibility.
- The 120-year limit is immediately specified, showing the "not-olam" means the 120 years before
  the Flood.

## Jer 51:57 — Pericope Context

```
# Jeremiah 51:57

> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise [men], her captains, and her rulers, and her
> mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name
> [is] the LORD of hosts.

Testament: OT | Author: Jeremiah | Words: 40

## Immediate Context (Pericope): Jeremiah 51:57 — Jeremiah 51:60 (4 verses)

>>51:57 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise [men], her captains, and her rulers, and
       her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose
       name [is] the LORD of hosts.
 51:58 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her
       high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in
       the fire, and they shall be weary.
 51:59 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah,
       when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign.
       And [this] Seraiah [was] a quiet prince.
 51:60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, [even] all these
       words that are written against Babylon.
```

**Study notes:**
- "Perpetual sleep and not wake" (shenath olam... lo yaqitsu): This is a judgment on Babylon's
  leaders — they will die and stay dead. The olam sleep is permanent death with no resurrection
  for these individuals in the context of this oracle.
- The phrase lo yaqitsu ("not awake/not arise") is the negative of the root yaqats. In Dan 12:2,
  the same root appears positively: "shall awake" (yaqitsu) — some to life, some to contempt.
  Jer 51:57 describes those who do NOT arise; Dan 12:2 is the general resurrection text where many
  DO arise. The contrast is intentional and theologically significant.
- Babylon's "perpetual sleep" is their final judgment — they are not among those who awake to
  life. Whether this implies non-resurrection or resurrection to contempt (Dan 12:2 category) is
  a question for the analysis agent.

## Psalm 9:5 — Pericope Context

```
# Psalm 9:5

> Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for
> ever and ever.

Testament: OT | Author: Unknown | Words: 20

## Immediate Context (Pericope): Psalms 9:1 — Psalms 9:6 (6 verses)

 9:1   To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David. I will praise [thee], O LORD, with
       my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
 9:2   I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
 9:3   When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
 9:4   For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
>>9:5  Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name
       for ever and ever.
 9:6   O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities;
       their memorial is perished with them.
```

**Study notes:**
- "For ever and ever" (le-olam wa-ed): The name of the wicked is blotted out — an OT idiom for
  permanent destruction of legacy/memory. Compare Ps 109:13 (name wiped out) and Prov 10:7
  (name of the wicked rots).
- Verse 9:6 immediately following: "destructions are come to a perpetual end" — the enemy is
  finished. "Their memorial is perished with them" — extinction of name and memory.
- This is a Category B (punishment/judgment) use of olam. The duration of "name blotting out"
  is permanent — no recovery. But the language describes permanent consequence (death/destruction),
  not ongoing conscious suffering.
- Note: KJV Ps 9:5 = BHSA Ps 9:6 due to verse numbering offset (superscription counted as v.1).

## Psalm 90:2 — Pericope Context

```
# Psalm 90:2

> Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even
> from everlasting to everlasting, thou [art] God.

Testament: OT | Author: Unknown | Words: 24

## Immediate Context (Pericope): Psalms 90:1 — Psalms 90:15 (15 verses)

 90:1  A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
>>90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
       even from everlasting to everlasting, thou [art] God.
 90:3  Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
 90:4  For a thousand years in thy sight [are but] as yesterday when it is past, and [as] a watch
       in the night.
 90:5  Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are [as] a sleep: in the morning [they are]
       like grass [which] groweth up.
 90:6  In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
 90:7  For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
 90:8  Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret [sins] in the light of thy countenance.
 90:9  For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale [that is told].
 90:10 The days of our years [are] threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength [they be]
       fourscore years, yet [is] their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we
       fly away.
 [continues...]
```

**Study notes:**
- "From everlasting to everlasting" (me-olam ad-olam): The ultimate temporal statement — olam in
  both directions (past and future), combined with ad (terminus). God's existence spans from the
  vanishing point of the past to the vanishing point of the future and beyond.
- This is a Category C (God's eternity) use — olam at its strongest, describing divine existence
  before creation itself.
- The context (vv.3-10) contrasts God's eternal nature with human mortality: man returns to dust
  (v.3), a thousand years are as a day to God (v.4), men are as grass cut down (vv.5-6).
- The contrast makes the "me-olam ad-olam" statement about God even more emphatic — God has no
  temporal limits, unlike mortal humanity.

## Mal 4:1-3 — Pericope Context

```
# Malachi 4:1

> For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do
> wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts,
> that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.

Testament: OT | Author: Minor_Prophets | Words: 47

## Immediate Context (Pericope): Malachi 4:1 — Malachi 4:5 (5 verses)

>>4:1  For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all
       that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the
       LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
 4:2   But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his
       wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.
 4:3   And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in
       the day that I shall do [this], saith the LORD of hosts.
 4:4   Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel,
       [with] the statutes and judgments.
 4:5   Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day
       of the LORD:
```

**Study notes:**
- Mal 4:1 does not use H5769 (olam) directly. The temporal language is "the day that cometh."
- The imagery is fire-as-consuming: the wicked become "stubble" burned up, leaving "neither root
  nor branch." Root and branch = complete destruction of lineage and existence.
- Mal 4:3 confirms the result: "they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet." Ashes = total
  consumption by fire, nothing remaining. This is annihilation imagery, not ongoing torment.
- The contrast structure (4:1 wicked burned up vs. 4:2 righteous healed and freed) parallels the
  Dan 12:2 contrast (life vs. contempt). Both texts use fire as destruction, not as ongoing torment.
- Cross-testament parallels could not be retrieved for Mal 4:1 via the parallel tool (Malachias
  book name not recognized).

## Isa 66:24 — Pericope Context

```
# Isaiah 66:24

> And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me:
> for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring
> unto all flesh.

Testament: OT | Author: Isaiah | Words: 39

## Immediate Context (Pericope): Isaiah 66:23 — Isaiah 66:24 (2 verses)

 66:23 And it shall come to pass, [that] from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to
       another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
>>66:24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed
       against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they
       shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
```

**Study notes:**
- Isa 66:24 does not use H5769 (olam). The temporal language is "worm shall not die" and "fire
  not quenched" — permanence expressed differently.
- Critical word: H6297 (peger = carcases/corpses). The observers look upon dead bodies, not living
  persons in torment. The subject is corpses.
- H1860 (dir'on = "abhorring/contempt") appears here and in Dan 12:2 only. The connection between
  the two passages: those who awake to "contempt" (dir'on) in Dan 12:2 may be associated with the
  visible disgrace of Isa 66:24.
- "Worm shall not die" — the fire and worm continue (consuming the corpses) until complete. The
  imagery is of unquenched fire consuming until nothing is left, not of immortal victims.
- This verse closes the entire book of Isaiah, making it the capstone statement on the fate of the
  transgressors. Jesus quotes it three times in Mark 9:44, 46, 48 (where it is applied to Gehenna).
```

---

## Additional Context: Isa 33:14 (Nave's FIRE, EVERLASTING sub-entry)

```
# Isaiah 33:14

> The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall
> dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

(Verse retrieved from earlier research — context not separately queried via tool)
```

**Study notes:**
- "Everlasting burnings" (moqde olam) is often cited as an OT reference to hell. But the context
  is a question about who can survive in God's holy presence.
- Isa 33:15-16 answers the question: "He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly... he
  shall dwell on high." The "everlasting burnings" = God's holy fire, not a punishment locale.
- This is a Category C (God's eternity / God's holiness) use of olam, not a punishment text.
- Compare Heb 12:29: "our God is a consuming fire" — the same concept applied to God's nature.
- Nave's lists this under FIRE, EVERLASTING — but the original context is about God's holiness,
  not punishment. The analysis agent should note this distinction.
