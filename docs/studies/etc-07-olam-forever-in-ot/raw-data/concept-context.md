# Raw Concept Context Results — etc-07

## Daniel 12:2
**"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt."**

### Concepts Identified
- **LIFE**: Chay/zoe — living, alive, life (H2416)

### Same Chapter Connections
1. **Daniel 12:7** [LIFE] — "sware by him that liveth for ever" — same olam used of God's eternal life, contextualizing the "everlasting life" of 12:2

### Key Cross-Book Connections
- **1 Cor 15:19** [LIFE] — "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable"
- **1 Cor 15:45** [LIFE] — "The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit"
- **Gen 2:7** [LIFE] — dust + living = the creation paradigm behind "sleep in the dust" awakening
- **Isa 26:19** — "Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise" — the primary OT resurrection parallel

### Observations
The concept_context tool finds LIFE as the dominant concept. This connects Dan 12:2 to the broader life/death framework: "everlasting life" is the positive outcome, while "everlasting contempt" is the negative. The question is whether "contempt" describes a conscious ongoing state or the permanent result (being permanently despised/abhorrent).

## Isaiah 34:10
**"It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever."**

### Concepts Identified
- No theological concepts found by the tool (the verse uses physical/judgment imagery without the tagged theological concept terms)

### Manual Observations
This is significant — the tool's concept database does not tag this verse with LIFE, DEATH, JUDGMENT, or other standard theological concepts. The verse is purely physical/geographic judgment language applied to Edom (cf. 34:5-6 "sword of the LORD... upon Idumea"). The "forever" language describes the completeness and irreversibility of territorial judgment, not an ontological claim about eternal duration.

Key contextual note: Isaiah 34:11-17 describes owls, ravens, cormorants, hedgehogs, and other animals inhabiting this same land whose smoke "goes up forever." The animals cannot coexist with literal unending fire.

## Jeremiah 17:4
**"And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, [which] shall burn for ever."**

### Concepts Identified
- **INHERITANCE**: Nachalah/kleronomia — inheritance, heritage (H5159)
- **WORSHIP**: Shachah/proskyneo — bow down, worship (H5647)
- **OBEDIENCE**: Shama/hypakouo — hear, obey, listen (H5647)
- **WRATH**: Aph/orge — anger, fury, indignation (H639)

### Same Chapter Connections
1. **Jer 17:16** [WORSHIP] — prophet's faithfulness contrasted with people's unfaithfulness
2. **Jer 17:20** [OBEDIENCE] — "Hear ye the word of the LORD"
3. **Jer 17:23** [OBEDIENCE] — "But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear"
4. **Jer 17:24** [OBEDIENCE] — conditional: "if ye diligently hearken unto me"
5. **Jer 17:27** [OBEDIENCE] — "then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched"

### Same Book Connections
- **Jer 13:10** [OBEDIENCE, WORSHIP] — refusal to hear + serving other gods
- **Jer 21:12** [WORSHIP, WRATH] — "lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it"
- **Jer 22:9** [OBEDIENCE, WORSHIP] — forsaken covenant, served other gods
- **Jer 25:6** [OBEDIENCE, WORSHIP] — "go not after other gods to serve them"

### Same Author Connections (Lamentations)
- **Lam 2:3** [WORSHIP, WRATH] — "he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire"
- **Lam 1:12** [WRATH] — "the day of his fierce anger"

### Key Observation
Jeremiah 17:4 says the fire of God's anger "shall burn for ever" (olam). But:
1. **Jer 17:27** applies the same fire imagery to Jerusalem's gates — fulfilled in 586 BC by Babylon
2. **Jer 21:12** uses "fire that none can quench" — same unquenchable fire, historically fulfilled
3. The wrath/fire was fulfilled in the Babylonian exile and destruction

This is decisive evidence that "burn for ever" (olam) in prophetic judgment language means "burn until completely consumed" or "burn irreversibly" — not "burn for infinite duration." The WRATH and OBEDIENCE concepts show this is covenantal judgment language, not ontological duration language.
