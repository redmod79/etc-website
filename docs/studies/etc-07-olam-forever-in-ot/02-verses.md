## Category C: Human/Finite Subjects (Olam = Limited Duration)

### C1. Slave Service (The Clearest Finite Use)

> **Exodus 21:6** — Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him **for ever**.

> **Deuteronomy 15:17** — Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust [it] through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant **for ever**. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

*NOTE: "Forever" = the slave's remaining lifetime. Death terminates the service. This is universally acknowledged as a limited olam.*

### C2. Jonah's Three Days

> **Jonah 2:6** — I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars [was] about me **for ever**: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.

*NOTE: Jonah's "forever" lasted approximately three days. The word here conveys the subjective experience of interminable duration, not objective endlessness.*

### C3. Prevented Immortality

> **Genesis 3:22** — And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and **live for ever**:

*NOTE: God prevented humans from living olam. This passage uses olam for a potential human duration that God specifically blocked.*

### C4. Human Mortality

> **Zechariah 1:5** — Your fathers, where [are] they? and the prophets, do they live **for ever**?

*NOTE: Rhetorical question expecting "no." Humans do not live olam — even prophets die.*

> **Ecclesiastes 1:4** — [One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh: but the earth abideth **for ever**.

> **Ecclesiastes 2:16** — For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool **for ever**; seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten.

> **Ecclesiastes 3:11** — He hath made every [thing] beautiful in his time: also he hath set **the world** [olam] in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

> **Ecclesiastes 3:14** — I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be **for ever**: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it.

> **Ecclesiastes 9:6** — Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion **for ever** in any [thing] that is done under the sun.

> **Ecclesiastes 12:5** — Also [when] they shall be afraid of [that which is] high, and fears [shall be] in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his **long home**, and the mourners go about the streets:

### C5. Hannah's Dedication

> **1 Samuel 1:22** — But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, [I will not go up] until the child be weaned, and [then] I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide **for ever**.

*NOTE: Samuel served at Shiloh for his lifetime — not literally "forever."*

### C6. Conditional Royal Promises

> **1 Samuel 2:30** — Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed [that] thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me **for ever**: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

*NOTE: God explicitly revokes an "olam" promise due to unfaithfulness. The "forever" was conditional all along.*

> **1 Samuel 13:13-14** — And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel **for ever**. But now thy kingdom shall not continue.

> **1 Samuel 27:12** — And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant **for ever**.

### C7. Leprosy and Curses

> **2 Kings 5:27** — The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed **for ever**. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.

### C8. Physical Features

> **Genesis 49:26** — The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the **everlasting** hills.

> **Habakkuk 3:6** — He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the **everlasting** mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways [are] everlasting.

> **Psalm 104:5** — [Who] laid the foundations of the earth, [that] it should not be removed **for ever**.

*NOTE: The "everlasting" mountains were "scattered" by God. "Everlasting" describes perceived permanence, not absolute indestructibility.*

### C9. Levitical Property

> **Leviticus 25:34** — But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it [is] their **perpetual** possession.

> **Leviticus 25:46** — And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit [them for] a possession; they shall be your bondmen **for ever**.

---

## Category D: Past Time ("Of Old")

When olam looks backward, it means "ancient time" or "long ago."

> **Genesis 6:4** — There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare [children] to them, the same [became] mighty men which [were] **of old**, men of renown.

> **Isaiah 64:4** — For **since the beginning of the world** [men] have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee.

> **Ecclesiastes 1:10** — Is there [any] thing whereof it may be said, See, this [is] new? it hath been already **of old time**, which was before us.

*NOTE: Olam looking backward is never rendered "eternally past" but rather "ancient times" or "long ago" — a finite, indefinite past period.*

### E2. Edom's "Eternal" Destruction

> **Isaiah 34:9-10** — And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.

*NOTE: v. 10 says the smoke goes up "forever" and none pass through "forever." But v. 11-17 describe animals living there. The "forever" is not literal — it describes complete, irreversible judgment.*

> **Malachi 1:4** — Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation **for ever**.
