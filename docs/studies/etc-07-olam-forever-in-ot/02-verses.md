## Question

What does H5769 (olam) mean in the OT? Does it always denote endless duration, or does context determine the actual duration implied?

---

## Category A — Olam with Clearly Limited Duration

These passages demonstrate that olam can describe finite duration bounded by context, death, or an explicit "until" clause. They establish the lower bound of the semantic range.

---

### Genesis 6:3 — Spirit NOT striving olam (negated)

> And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

**Note:** "always" = le-olam, here *negated*. The duration is immediately limited to 120 years by the following clause. Olam is bounded in the same sentence.

---

### Genesis 9:12,16 — Everlasting Covenant (Noahic)

> (v.12) And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for **perpetual** generations:

> (v.16) And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the **everlasting** covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

**Note:** H5769 in "perpetual generations" and "everlasting covenant." Context: the rainbow covenant, which by its nature is ongoing as long as the created order exists.

---

### Genesis 17:7-8,13,19 — Everlasting Covenant, Everlasting Possession

> (v.7) And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an **everlasting** covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

> (v.8) And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an **everlasting** possession; and I will be their God.

> (v.13) He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an **everlasting** covenant.

> (v.19) And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an **everlasting** covenant, and with his seed after him.

**Note:** "Everlasting possession" for Canaan — the land was later lost in exile (605-586 BC, exiles continue); Israel was displaced for centuries. This is a foundational example of olam applied to something that has demonstrably ended or been suspended. The "everlasting covenant" in this context means the covenant is of the olam-type (no expiration date specified), not that every element is literally without end.

---

### Genesis 21:33 — El Olam (Everlasting God)

> And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the **everlasting** God.

**Note:** El Olam — God's own attribute. This is genuinely infinite (Category C), but included here as the first occurrence of "El Olam" in Scripture. God's olam is not the same as a servant's olam (Exo 21:6).

---

### Exodus 12:14,17 — Passover Ordinance "For Ever"

> (v.14) And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance **for ever**.

> (v.17) And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance **for ever**.

**Note:** Olam applied to the Passover observance "throughout your generations" (le-doroteychem). The Passover/unleavened bread feast was a national Mosaic institution that ended with the supersession of the Mosaic covenant. The "for ever" is qualified by "throughout your generations" — olam bounded by generational scope.

---

### Exodus 15:18 — LORD Reigns For Ever and Ever

> The LORD shall reign **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** Le-olam wa-ed compound. Applied to God — genuinely infinite (Category C, but included here as the first le-olam wa-ed compound). For comparison with Isa 34:10's netsach netsachim (for ever and ever) applied to Edom's desolation.

---

### Exodus 21:6 — Servant Serves Master "For Ever"

> Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him **for ever**.

**Note:** Le-olam. A slave who voluntarily stays with his master serves "for ever" — clearly bounded by the servant's death. Deuteronomy 15:17 restates this: "he shall be thy servant for ever." The duration is a human lifetime, terminated at death. This is the paradigmatic example of olam with a clearly finite duration.

**Hebrew (from parsing):** וַעֲבָדֹ֖ו לְעֹלָֽם — the word עֹלָֽם (olam) here means "to the olam" = for the remainder of the subject's existence.

---

### Leviticus 25:44-46 — Bondservants "For Ever"

> (v.44) Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.

> (v.46) And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen **for ever**: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.

**Note:** Olam applied to the bondservants from foreign nations — "bondmen for ever." This stands in contrast to the Israelite servant who goes free at Jubilee (v.40-41). The non-Israelite bondmen serve "for ever" but this is still bounded by mortal existence. The Jubilee law (vv.39-42) applies specifically to Israelites, not foreigners — the "for ever" for foreigners means lifetime bondage.

---

### Deuteronomy 23:3 — Ammonite/Moabite Excluded "For Ever"

> An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD **for ever**:

**Note:** Olam — "for ever." This is qualified within the same verse: "even to their tenth generation." The "for ever" is further defined as "to their tenth generation." Nehemiah 13:1-3 applies this exclusion, showing it was an operative, not infinite, temporal designation.

---

### Joshua 4:7 — Memorial "For Ever"

> (Context: stones set up as memorial for Israel's crossing of Jordan)

> Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel **for ever**.

**Note:** Olam — the memorial stones, now buried under centuries of history. The stones' existence as a visible memorial eventually ended.

---

### 1 Samuel 1:22 — Samuel to Abide "For Ever"

> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide **for ever**.

**Note:** Le-olam — "abide for ever." Samuel died (1 Sam 25:1). The "for ever" here means "permanently" in the sense of "for his entire life devoted to the LORD's service." Duration: his lifetime.

**Hebrew (from parsing):** וְיָ֥שַׁב שָׁ֖ם עַד־עֹולָֽם — literally "and dwell there unto olam." Note: the preposition here is עַד (ad, up to) + עֹולָם (olam), which is "ad-olam" — "unto the vanishing point."

---

### 1 Samuel 2:30 — Eli's House "For Ever" — Revoked

> Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me **for ever**: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

> (v.31) Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.

**Note:** Olam — God said Eli's house would serve "for ever," then explicitly revoked it in the same verse. This is a definitive example of olam describing a conditional promise, not an unconditional infinite duration. The "for ever" was contingent on faithfulness; when faithfulness failed, the olam promise was cancelled.

---

### 1 Kings 2:33 — Guilt "For Ever" / Peace "For Ever"

> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed **for ever**: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace **for ever** from the LORD.

**Note:** Olam twice in the same verse — guilt upon Joab's descendants (negative) and peace on David's throne (positive). Both are olam. Joab's descendants do not carry guilt to the resurrection; David's throne is ultimately fulfilled in Christ (Luke 1:32-33). The olam in both cases means "lasting/permanent within the appropriate frame."

---

### 2 Kings 5:27 — Leprosy Cleave "For Ever"

> The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed **for ever**. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.

**Note:** Olam — leprosy cleaving to Gehazi and his seed "for ever." Historically, Gehazi's descendants are not known to be leprous to this day. The "for ever" means a permanent, irrevocable judgment within the framework of mortal succession.

---

### 2 Chronicles 7:16 — Temple Consecrated "For Ever" — Later Destroyed

> For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there **for ever**: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

**Note:** Olam and tamid (perpetually) both applied to the Jerusalem temple. The temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC. The "for ever" was fulfilled within the covenant framework; when the covenant was violated, the temple's dedication was cancelled (2 Chr 7:19-22 gives the conditional clause).

---

### Jonah 2:6 — "For Ever" in Fish Belly (Three Days)

> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me **for ever**: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.

**Note:** Le-olam. Jonah describes being "for ever" under the earth/in the fish — the actual duration was three days (Jonah 1:17). This is perhaps the most striking example: olam applied to an experience that lasted 72 hours. The word describes Jonah's subjective sense of permanent entrapment, immediately followed by rescue. "For ever" cannot mean "infinite" here — it was three days.

**Hebrew (from parsing):** Note that Jonah 2:6 in the BHSA Hebrew text presents differently — the olam in the KJV "for ever" corresponds to verse 6 in the LXX but the parsing above showed verse 6 without olam. The KJV verse structure is slightly different from BHSA verse division. The "for ever" in the KJV of Jonah 2:6 comes from "the earth with her bars was about me le-olam." See cross-reference with context.

---

### Isaiah 32:14-15 — Forsaken "For Ever" — "Until" Spirit Poured

> (v.14) Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens **for ever**, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

> (v.15) **Until** the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.

**Note:** Olam — "dens for ever" — immediately qualified by "until the spirit be poured upon us." This is a classic "olam until" construction. The desolation is olam in character (indefinitely long), but explicitly bounded by the "until" clause. Olam here = "until the Spirit comes" — a definite future event.

---

### Psalm 77:7-9 — "Will the LORD Cast Off For Ever?" (Rhetorical)

> (v.7) Will the Lord cast off **for ever**? and will he be favourable no more?

> (v.8) Is his mercy clean gone **for ever**? doth his promise fail for evermore?

> (v.9) Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.

> (v.10) And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.

**Note:** Olam (v.7), netsach (v.8). The Psalmist asks whether God's rejection is "for ever" — a rhetorical question answered negatively by the rest of the psalm (vv.11-20: God's past works are recalled). The questions use olam and netsach as terms of indefinite duration, not literally infinite duration. Compare Lamentations 3:31: "the Lord will not cast off for ever" — directly contradicting a literal reading of "cast off le-olam."

---

### Lamentations 5:19-20 — "Forget Us For Ever?"

> (v.19) Thou, O LORD, remainest **for ever**; thy throne from generation to generation.

> (v.20) Wherefore dost thou forget us **for ever**, and forsake us so long time?

**Note:** Two uses of olam in the same passage — God's own permanence (v.19, genuinely infinite) and Israel's abandonment (v.20, clearly temporary/rhetorical). Lamentations 3:31 provides the answer: "the Lord will not cast off for ever."

---

### Obadiah 1:10 — Edom Cut Off "For Ever"

> For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off **for ever**.

**Note:** Olam — Edom cut off for ever. Obadiah 1:16 completes the picture: "they shall be as though they had not been" — total annihilation, not endless conscious existence. The "for ever" describes the permanence of the cutting off, not ongoing experience.

---

## Category B — Olam in Punishment/Judgment Contexts

These are the central debate passages. The question is whether olam in judgment contexts necessarily implies endless conscious experience.

---

### Isaiah 33:14 — "Everlasting Burnings"

> (v.13) Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.

> (v.14) The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with **everlasting burnings**?

> (v.15) He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

> (v.16) He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.

**Note:** "Everlasting burnings" is a description of God's holy fire, not a punishment. The rhetorical question "who shall dwell with everlasting burnings?" is answered positively: the righteous person (v.15) CAN dwell with them. The "everlasting burnings" = God's holy presence, which righteous people can endure. This is NOT a punishment text — it is a description of divine holiness. Nave's FIRE entry lists it as "EVERLASTING FIRE" (ISA 33:14) but the context makes clear this is figurative for God's holiness.

---

### Isaiah 34:5-17 — Edom: Smoke Ascendeth "For Ever" / "For Ever and Ever"

**Verses 5-10 (judgment section):**

> (v.5) For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.

> (v.6) The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.

> (v.7) And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.

> (v.8) For it is the day of the LORD'S vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.

> (v.9) And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.

> (v.10) It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up **for ever**: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it **for ever and ever**.

**Verses 11-17 (aftermath: animals dwelling there):**

> (v.11) But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

> (v.12) They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

> (v.13) And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.

> (v.14) The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.

> (v.15) There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.

> (v.16) Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.

> (v.17) And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it **for ever**, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

**Note:** Critical observations:
1. v.10: "smoke... go up for ever" — le-olam (H5769)
2. v.10: "none shall pass through it for ever and ever" — le-netsach netsachim (H5331 intensified)
3. v.11-17: Animals dwell there. This is not a scene of ongoing fire/burning — it is desolation where wild animals make nests and breed.
4. v.17: The animals "possess it for ever" — olam applied to the animals' habitation of the desolated land.
5. Modern geography: Edom (modern Jordan/Petra region) is uninhabited wilderness with ruins, but NOT actively burning with smoke ascending.
6. The cross-testament parallel tool scores REV 14:11 at 0.401 for this passage — Revelation reuses the language of Isa 34:10 for its own purposes.
7. The "smoke ascending for ever" = metaphor for permanent, irrevocable destruction, not literal ongoing combustion.

**Hebrew parsing highlights (from Isa 34:10):**
- לְעֹולָ֖ם (le-olam) = "to eternity" — Noun.ms.Abs., preposition ל
- לְנֵ֣צַח נְצָחִ֔ים (le-netsach netsachim) = "to glory of glories" — netsach (ms.Cst) + netsachim (mp.Abs) — a construct-state intensification

---

### Jeremiah 17:4 — Fire That Shall Burn "For Ever"

> And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn **for ever**.

**Note:** Olam — "burn for ever." This is God's anger against Judah. The fire of divine anger burning "for ever" is metaphorical for a severe, permanent-in-effect judgment. Judah was taken into exile, returned after 70 years, and was restored. The "for ever" describes the severity of the judgment, not an unending literal fire.

---

### Jeremiah 20:11 — Everlasting Confusion

> But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their **everlasting confusion** shall never be forgotten.

**Note:** Olam — "everlasting confusion." The persecutors of Jeremiah will experience a confusion/shame that is olam in character. The phrase "shall never be forgotten" (lo tishakach) indicates the shame is permanently on the record — not necessarily that the individuals exist forever experiencing it.

---

### Jeremiah 23:39-40 — Perpetual Shame for False Prophets

> (v.39) Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:

> (v.40) And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a **perpetual shame**, which shall not be forgotten.

**Note:** Olam — "everlasting reproach" (cherpat olam) and "perpetual shame" (bosheth olam). For the false prophets. The shame is permanent on the historical record. Cross-testament parallel tool finds Daniel 12:2's "reproach" (cherpot) as a key OT parallel — the same word.

---

### Jeremiah 25:9,12 — Perpetual Desolations

> (v.9) Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land... and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and **perpetual desolations**.

> (v.12) And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it **perpetual desolations**.

**Note:** Olam in "perpetual desolations." Note v.11: the nations were to serve Babylon for "seventy years" — a finite period explicitly given. Then v.12: the Chaldean land itself becomes "perpetual desolations." The finite 70 years for service is contrasted with the olam desolation of Babylon after judgment. Modern Babylon/Iraq exists and has a population — the "perpetual desolation" describes permanent ruin, not ongoing burning.

---

### Jeremiah 49:13,33 — Bozrah and Hazor Perpetual Wastes

> (v.13) For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be **perpetual wastes**.

> (v.33) And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation **for ever**: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.

**Note:** Olam — both Bozrah and Hazor (near ancient Edom/Ammon) described as perpetual/for ever waste. These are historical cities whose ruins exist — desolated, not burning endlessly.

---

### Jeremiah 51:39,57 — Babylon Sleeps "Perpetual Sleep"

> (v.39) In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a **perpetual sleep**, and not wake, saith the LORD.

> (v.57) And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a **perpetual sleep**, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.

**Note:** Shnat-olam — "sleep of eternity" (construct chain: שְׁנַת + עֹולָם). "Sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake." This is death described as olam sleep. The same verb "not wake" (lo yaqitsu) appears in Dan 12:2's resurrection: "many that sleep... shall awake." The "perpetual sleep" of Jer 51 is the state from which Dan 12:2 describes a resurrection — meaning the olam sleep is interrupted by resurrection. The olam duration of the sleep ends at the resurrection.

**Hebrew parsing (Jer 51:57):** וְיָשְׁנ֥וּ שְׁנַת־עֹולָ֖ם וְלֹ֣א יָקִ֑יצוּ — "and they shall sleep sleep-of-olam and not awaken."

---

### Ezekiel 26:20-21 — Tyre: "Thou Shalt Be No More"

> (v.20) When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;

> (v.21) I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.

**Note:** No olam here, but a direct statement: "thou shalt be no more" and "never be found again." The vocabulary of permanent annihilation, not ongoing torment. Compare Obadiah 1:16 (etc5-06): "as though they had not been."

---

### Ezekiel 35:5,9 — Perpetual Hatred / Perpetual Desolations (Edom)

> (v.5) Because thou hast had a **perpetual hatred**, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:

> (v.9) I will make thee **perpetual desolations**, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

**Note:** Olam — both Edom's characteristic and its judgment are olam. Edom's "perpetual hatred" = ongoing hatred during its existence. The "perpetual desolations" = permanent ruin after judgment. Both limited to the historical-moral frame of Edom's existence.

---

### Daniel 12:1-3 — Everlasting Life / Everlasting Contempt

> (v.1) And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.

> (v.2) And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to **everlasting life**, and some to shame and **everlasting contempt**.

> (v.3) And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** This is the critical OT text. Key observations:
1. **Identical grammatical construction** for both outcomes: לְחַיֵּ֣י עֹולָ֔ם (le-chayyei olam = to everlasting life) and לְדִרְאֹ֥ון עֹולָֽם (le-dir'on olam = to everlasting contempt). The SAME word olam, the SAME prepositional/construct pattern, for BOTH destinies.
2. **Dir'on** (contempt/abhorrence) = H1860 דִּרְאוֹן — occurs only here and Isa 66:24, where it describes CORPSES (peger = dead bodies, not living beings). In Isa 66:24, the objects that are "an abhorring" are carcasses.
3. **Resurrection context**: "sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake" — the subject is dead people being raised. The resurrection text presupposes prior death/unconsciousness (sleep).
4. v.3: olam wa-ad for the righteous shining "for ever and ever."

**Hebrew parsing (Dan 12:2):**
- לְחַיֵּ֣י עֹולָ֔ם — "to life of eternity" (le + chayyei [mp.Cst] + olam [ms.Abs])
- לְדִרְאֹ֥ון עֹולָֽם — "to abhorrence of eternity" (le + dir'on [ms.Cst] + olam [ms.Abs])
- Both are construct chains with identical structure.
- יָקִ֑יצוּ (yaqitzu) — Hiphil.Impf.3mp of קיץ — "they shall awaken/pass summer" — same root as Jer 51:39,57 "not wake"

---

### Psalm 9:5 — Name Blotted Out "For Ever and Ever"

> Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** Le-olam va-ed — the compound "for ever and ever" applied to the blotting out of the wicked's name. The wicked are "destroyed" (ibad, H6) and their name extinguished — the language is of annihilation, not ongoing torment. The "for ever and ever" intensifies the permanence of the destruction.

**Hebrew parsing (Ps 9:6 Hebrew = Ps 9:5 KJV):**
- גָּעַ֣רְתָּ גֹ֭ויִם אִבַּ֣דְתָּ רָשָׁ֑ע שְׁמָ֥ם מָ֝חִ֗יתָ לְעֹולָ֥ם וָעֶֽד
- מָ֝חִ֗יתָ (machita) — "thou hast wiped/blotted out"
- לְעֹולָ֥ם וָעֶֽד — le-olam va-ed (eternity and future) — the compound intensifier
- Note: עֶֽד here is H5703 (ad), confirming the le-olam wa-ed compound.

---

### Psalm 77:7-8 — Rhetorical "For Ever" Questions

(See Category A above)

---

### Psalm 92:7 — Wicked Destroyed "For Ever"

> When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed **for ever**:

> (v.8) But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.

> (v.9) For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

**Note:** Olam — "destroyed for ever." The verb is shamad (H8045 = to destroy, annihilate). Destruction (shamad) that is "for ever" = permanent destruction. v.9 uses abad (H6) = "shall perish." The direction is toward annihilation, with olam describing its permanence.

---

### Malachi 4:1-3 — The Burning Day

> (v.1) For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.

> (v.2) But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.

> (v.3) And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.

**Note:** No olam in this passage — "for ever" is not used. Included here because of its connection to Isa 34:9 (burning context) and the judgment vocabulary. Key: "shall burn them up... leave them neither root nor branch... they shall be ashes." The outcome is described as complete consumption, not endless burning. Compare: Isa 34:9-10 uses burning imagery but the aftermath is desolation with animals dwelling (not ongoing fire). Mal 4 uses burning imagery but the result is ashes. Both point to completed, permanent destruction.

---

### Malachi 1:4 — Edom: Indignation "For Ever"

> Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation **for ever**.

**Note:** Olam — "indignation for ever." The historical Edomites were dispersed and absorbed by surrounding nations. "For ever" here describes a permanent state of divine displeasure/judgment, not endless conscious torment for individual Edomites.

### Isaiah 66:24 — Corpses, Undying Worm, Unquenching Fire

> And they shall go forth, and look upon the **carcases** of the men that have transgressed against me: for their **worm** shall not die, neither shall their **fire** be quenched; and they shall be an **abhorring** unto all flesh.

**Note:** Critical observations:
1. The subject is **peger** (carcases/dead bodies) — not living, conscious beings.
2. "Abhorring" = dir'on (H1860) — the SAME word used in Dan 12:2 for "everlasting contempt." In Isa 66:24, this abhorring is applied to corpses.
3. The "not quenched" (lo tikbeh) is NOT olam — it uses the "not quenched" (unquenching) construction, not the "for ever" construction.
4. The "worm shall not die" = the worms continuously consuming the corpses — not the corpses themselves being eternally conscious.
5. This passage is cited in Mark 9:44,46,48 by Jesus as a description of Gehenna. The language is from Isa 66:24, where the objects are dead bodies.

### Jeremiah 50:39 (Category E — netsach example)

> (Context: Babylon destroyed, never inhabited again)
> Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited **for ever**; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.

**Note:** Netsach (H5331) — "for ever." Here netsach describes the permanent desolation of Babylon, with animals dwelling in it — same pattern as Isa 34:11-17 for Edom. "No more inhabited for ever" = permanent, not ongoing burning.

---

## Category C — Olam for God's Eternity (Clearly Endless)

These passages establish the upper bound of olam's semantic range — genuinely infinite duration applied to God and His attributes.

---

### Psalm 90:1-2 — From Everlasting to Everlasting

> (v.1) Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

> (v.2) Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even **from everlasting to everlasting**, thou art God.

**Note:** Me-olam ad-olam — "from olam to olam." Applied to God: He pre-existed mountains and creation itself. Here olam extends backward beyond creation and forward without end. This is the paradigmatic infinite use. The double preposition "from... to" sets olam as the boundary in both temporal directions.

---

### Psalm 93:1-2 — Throne Established "Of Old" / "From Everlasting"

> (v.1) The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

> (v.2) Thy throne is established **of old**: thou art **from everlasting**.

**Note:** Olam (throne "of old") and olam (God "from everlasting"). God's throne and existence are both described as olam — backward in time without known beginning. Applied to God: genuinely boundless.

---

### Isaiah 40:28 — The Everlasting God

> Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the **everlasting** God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.

**Note:** Elohei olam — "the God of eternity/everlasting." Olam as God's fundamental attribute. Genuinely infinite.

---

### Isaiah 57:15 — God Inhabits Eternity

> For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth **eternity**, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.

**Note:** Ad (H5703) — "inhabiteth eternity." This uses H5703 (ad) rather than H5769 (olam), though both words can translate "eternity/for ever." Ad as God's dwelling place = genuinely infinite.

---

### Deuteronomy 33:27 — The Eternal God

> The **eternal** God is thy refuge, and underneath are the **everlasting** arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.

**Note:** Elohei qedem ("God of antiquity/ancient" — H6924) + zero'ot olam ("arms of eternity" — H5769). God's arms are olam — genuinely eternal.

---

### Genesis 21:33 — El Olam

> And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the **everlasting** God.

**Note:** El Olam — first explicit "Everlasting God" title. Genuinely infinite.

---

### Habakkuk 3:6 — Everlasting Mountains Scattered; God's Ways Everlasting

> He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the **everlasting** mountains were scattered, the **perpetual** hills did bow: his ways are **everlasting**.

**Note:** THREE uses of eternal vocabulary in one verse:
1. "Everlasting mountains" — harrei-ad (H5703) — the mountains described as olam-type are SCATTERED
2. "Perpetual hills" — giv'ot olam (H5769) — hills described as olam did BOW DOWN
3. "His ways are everlasting" — halichot olam lo (H5769) — God's ways are olam

This single verse demonstrates within itself that olam (and ad) do NOT guarantee the continuation of the thing described. The "everlasting mountains" are destroyed; God's ways endure. The duration is determined by the nature of the subject. Mountains: mortal (scattered when God moves). God's ways: genuinely eternal.

**Hebrew parsing (Hab 3:6):**
- הַרְרֵי־עַ֔ד (harrei-ad) — "mountains of perpetuity" — ad (H5703) in construct chain
- גִּבְעֹ֣ות עֹולָ֑ם (giv'ot olam) — "hills of eternity" — olam in construct chain
- הֲלִיכֹ֥ות עֹולָ֖ם לֹֽו (halichot olam lo) — "ways of eternity to him" — olam in construct chain

---

### Psalm 145:13 — Everlasting Kingdom

> Thy kingdom is an **everlasting** kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.

**Note:** Olam applied to God's kingdom — genuinely infinite.

---

### Isaiah 9:6-7 — Everlasting Father; No End to Government

> (v.6) For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The **everlasting** Father, The Prince of Peace.

> (v.7) Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David...

**Note:** Avi-ad — "Father of eternity" = Everlasting Father, using H5703 (ad). "No end" to his government — genuinely infinite.

---

## Category D — Compound Forever Phrases

Analysis of le-olam wa-ed and related intensification constructions.

---

### Exodus 15:18 — Le-olam Wa-ed for God's Reign

> The LORD shall reign **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** Le-olam wa-ed — compound applied to God's reign. Genuinely infinite.

---

### Psalm 10:16 — Lord King For Ever and Ever

> The LORD is King **for ever and ever**: the heathen are perished out of his land.

**Note:** Le-olam va-ed. God as king. Infinite. Note: immediately following, "the heathen are perished" — uses abad (H6, perish/destroy) for the wicked, while God's reign continues for ever and ever.

---

### Psalm 21:4 — Length of Days For Ever and Ever

> He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** Le-olam va-ed applied to the king's long life. In Messianic fulfillment = genuinely infinite; in immediate historical context = long reign.

---

### Psalm 45:6 — Throne For Ever and Ever

> Thy throne, O God, is **for ever and ever**: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.

**Note:** Le-olam va-ed for God's throne. Infinite.

---

### Psalm 48:14 — God Our God For Ever and Ever

> For this God is our God **for ever and ever**: he will be our guide even unto death.

**Note:** Le-olam va-ed. Infinite for God.

---

### Psalm 52:8 — Trust in God For Ever and Ever

> But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** Le-olam va-ed for the Psalmist's trust in God. Contextually: a lifetime of trust with eschatological hope.

---

### Psalm 119:44 — Keep Thy Law Continually For Ever and Ever

> So shall I keep thy law continually **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** Le-olam va-ed for law-keeping. The speaker's commitment is "for ever and ever" — bounded by their mortal existence, but expressed in olam-level terms.

---

### Psalm 145:1-2,21 — Bless Thy Name For Ever and Ever

> (v.1) I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name **for ever and ever**.
> (v.2) Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name **for ever and ever**.
> (v.21) My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** Le-olam va-ed for worship — expressed as ongoing and infinite.

---

### Isaiah 34:10 — Edom: "For Ever and Ever" Desolate (netsach netsachim)

> ...none shall pass through it **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** Le-netsach netsachim — a construct chain intensification using H5331 (netsach) rather than the standard le-olam wa-ed. This is the compound form of netsach rather than olam, but serves the same intensifying function. Applied to Edom's desolation — yet vv.11-17 describe animals dwelling there (not ongoing burning), and v.17 applies olam to the animals' permanent habitation.

**Hebrew parsing (Isa 34:10):**
- לְנֵ֣צַח נְצָחִ֔ים — le-netsach netsachim = "to glory-of-glories" or "to perpetuity of perpetuities"
- The construct chain: netsach (ms.Cst) + netsachim (mp.Abs) = intensified form

---

### Isaiah 45:17 — Everlasting Salvation: World Without End

> But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an **everlasting** salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded **world without end**.

**Note:** Olam + ad-olam — two olam-related terms in one verse for Israel's salvation. "World without end" = literally "from olam and unto olam" — bookending both directions of time.

---

### Daniel 12:3 — The Wise Shine For Ever and Ever

> And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** Le-olam va-ed for the righteous — genuinely infinite glory for the raised righteous.

---

### Micah 4:5 — Walk in the Name of LORD For Ever and Ever

> For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God **for ever and ever**.

**Note:** Olam va-ed compound.

---

## Category E — Related Temporal Terms for Comparison

### H5703 (ad) Examples

**1 Samuel 15:29 — The Strength of Israel**
> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
**Note:** "Strength of Israel" = Netsach Yisrael. H5331 used as a divine title here. Shows netsach can be a noun for "glory/strength" (1 Chr 29:11).

**Isaiah 9:6 — Everlasting Father (Avi-ad)**
> his name shall be called... The **everlasting** Father...
**Note:** Avi-ad — "Father of ad (perpetuity)." H5703.

**Isaiah 57:15 — Inhabiteth Eternity**
> the high and lofty One that inhabiteth **eternity**...
**Note:** Ad as God's domain — infinite.

**Habakkuk 3:6 — Mountains of Ad (Scattered)**
> the everlasting mountains were scattered...
**Note:** Harrei-ad — H5703 applied to mountains that are then scattered. Ad does not guarantee continuity.

**Psalm 9:18 — The Needy Shall Not Perish For Ever**
> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish **for ever**.
**Note:** La-netsach — "to netsach" (H5331). The needy's expectation shall not "perish for ever" = temporary abandonment, not permanent loss.

---

### H5331 (netsach) Examples

**Isaiah 25:8 — Death Swallowed Up in Victory**
> He will swallow up death **in victory** (la-netsach); and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces...
**Note:** La-netsach = "for ever/in victory/permanently." Death is swallowed up permanently — infinite in scope.

**Lamentations 3:18 — My Hope Perished**
> And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
**Note:** H5331 netsach (implied in context of despair). Jeremiah perceives total loss — but it is temporary (he is still alive in the chapter).

**Amos 1:11 — Perpetual Hatred**
> because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear **perpetually** (la-netsach), and he kept his wrath **for ever** (la-ad):
**Note:** Both netsach (H5331) and ad (H5703) used together for Edom's anger — both temporal words for Edom's characteristic disposition, not infinite experience.

**Amos 8:7 — Will Never Forget**
> The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will **never** (netsach) forget any of their works.
**Note:** Netsach in negative construction = "never." God's memory of Israel's deeds is permanent.

---

### H8548 (tamid) Examples

**Numbers 28:3 — Daily/Continual Sacrifice**
> This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a **continual** burnt offering.
**Note:** Tamid = regularity/daily occurrence. Describes the scheduled, repeated nature of the sacrifice — not infinite duration per se, but continual within the framework.

**Daniel 8:11 — Daily (Tamid) Taken Away**
> Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
**Note:** The tamid (daily/continual) is "taken away" — it is NOT unending, it is abolished. This confirms tamid describes regularity within a system, not infinite duration.

**Daniel 12:11 — Tamid Taken Away Again**
> And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
**Note:** Tamid and olam used in close proximity in Daniel. Tamid is measurable (1290 days), olam is qualitative. They are distinct concepts.

## Category F — Isa 66:24 and the Dir'on Connection

### Daniel 12:2 and Isaiah 66:24 — Dir'on (Abhorrence/Contempt)

**Daniel 12:2:**
> ...some to shame and **everlasting contempt** [le-dir'on olam].

**Isaiah 66:24:**
> ...they shall be an **abhorring** [le-dir'on] unto all flesh.

**Note:** H1860 dir'on appears only in these two verses in the entire Hebrew Bible.
- In Dan 12:2: "everlasting contempt" is the destiny of those raised from the dead.
- In Isa 66:24: the dir'on is applied to **carcases** (peger — dead bodies).
- The linguistic connection: the "abhorring" in Isa 66:24 = the "everlasting contempt" in Dan 12:2. Both describe bodies (dead in Isa 66:24) as the object of abhorrence. This suggests that the "everlasting contempt" in Dan 12:2 is the permanent condition of those whose resurrection results in judgment — their final state is represented by the Isa 66:24 image of repulsive corpses, not by ongoing conscious experience.
- The "fire not quenched" and "worm not dying" in Isa 66:24 does NOT use olam — it uses the "lo tishba / lo tamut" construction (not quenched / not die), describing thoroughness of judgment, not infinite duration.

## Edom Case Study — Cross-Reference

**Isa 34:10 ↔ Rev 14:11 (Cross-Testament Connection)**

The parallel tool scored REV 14:11 at 0.401 for Jesaia 34:10 (the highest NT match). This confirms the linguistic connection between Edom's "smoke ascending for ever" and the Revelation 14:11 language.

Revelation 14:11 reads: "And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" — this directly echoes Isa 34:9-10's language.

Key question for analysis: Does Rev 14:11's "for ever and ever" describe:
(a) Ongoing conscious torment that never ends, OR
(b) A permanent, irrevocable judgment whose RESULT is permanent (like Edom's permanent desolation)?

The OT source text (Isa 34:10) describes a RESULT (desolation where animals dwell, no ongoing burning), not an ongoing process. This is the hermeneutical key.
