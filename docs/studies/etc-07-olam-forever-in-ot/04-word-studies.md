## 1. H5769 — Olam (עוֹלָם)

### Full Lexicon Data

| Field | Data |
|-------|------|
| Strong's | H5769 |
| Hebrew | עוֹלָם (also spelled עֹלָם) |
| Transliteration | owlam / olam |
| Pronunciation | o-lawm |
| Part of Speech | masculine noun |
| BLB Count | 439 |

**Definition (Strong's/BDB):**
> "Properly, concealed, i.e. the vanishing point; generally, time out of mind (past or future), i.e. (practically) eternity; frequentatively, adverbial (especially with prepositional prefix) always."

**KJV renderings:** alway(-s), ancient (time), any more, continuance, eternal, (for, (n-)) ever(-lasting, -more, of old), lasting, long (time), (of) old (time), perpetual, at any time, (beginning of the) world (without end).

**Gesenius' additional notes (from Strong's entry):** Compare with H5765 (to be perverse/crooked) — the root idea of "concealed" relates to something at the vanishing point of vision. Neither the beginning nor the end of the "olam" period is in view — it refers to the far end of the horizon of time, whether past or future.

### KJV Rendering Statistics

| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| for ever | 198 | 45.8% |
| ever | 70 | 16.2% |
| everlasting | 56 | 13.0% |
| perpetual | 22 | 5.1% |
| of old | 13 | 3.0% |
| evermore | 8 | 1.9% |

| for evermore | 7 | 1.6% |
| never | 6 | 1.4% |
| from everlasting | 5 | 1.2% |
| ancient | 4 | 0.9% |
| always | 3 | 0.7% |
| of old time | 3 | 0.7% |
| alway | 2 | 0.5% |
| and ever | 2 | 0.5% |
| any more | 2 | 0.5% |
| world (world without end, in the world) | 3 | ~0.7% |
| long (his long home, long time) | 2 | 0.5% |
| *Other rare renderings* | ~11 | ~2.5% |
| **Total** | **432** | **100%** |

**Key observation:** The KJV translates H5769 as "world" (Ecc 3:11, "he hath set the world [olam] in their heart"), "long" (Ecc 12:5, "his long home"), "of old" (Isa 46:9, "former things of old"), "ancient" (Job 22:15, "old way"), and "never" (Ps 9:18 negated). This diversity of translation reflects the context-dependent nature of olam's temporal reference.

**Total occurrences:** 432 (Strong's count); 439 (BLB count — variation reflects counting method).

### LXX Translation Data

H5769 is translated into Greek as follows (ranked by PMI-weighted frequency):

| Greek Word | Occurrences | PMI | Score | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-----|-------|-------|
| G165 αἰών (aion) | 287 | 5.55 | 31.41 | Primary translation; "an age" |
| G166 αἰώνιος (aionios) | 100 | 5.67 | 26.16 | "Pertaining to an age/perpetual" |
| G1074 γενεά (genea) | 51 | 4.37 | 17.25 | "Generation" |
| G3545 νομίμως (nomimos) | 30 | 4.96 | 17.03 | "Legitimately" (in ritual contexts) |
| G1656 ἔλεος (eleos) | 57 | 3.85 | 15.61 | "Mercy" (in Ps 136 refrain contexts) |
| G165 eis tous aionas (compound) | — | — | — | "Into the ages" compound |

**Critical LXX Observation:**
- H5769 → G165 (aion) 287 times (PMI 5.55)
- H5769 → G166 (aionios) 100 times (PMI 5.67)
- The LXX translators systematically chose aion and aionios as the Greek equivalent of Hebrew olam
- This means NT aionios carries the same semantic range as OT olam
- If olam does not inherently mean "infinite," then aionios does not inherently mean "infinite" either
- The punishment texts using aionios (Matt 25:41,46; 2 Th 1:9; Rev 14:6; Heb 9:12) inherit the context-dependent duration of olam

**Notable:** The LXX also occasionally translates olam as genea (generation), eleos (mercy), and other terms, showing that even Greek translators sometimes rendered the context more specifically rather than always using aion/aionios.

## 2. H5703 — Ad (עַד)

### Full Lexicon Data

| Field | Data |
|-------|------|
| Strong's | H5703 |
| Hebrew | עַד |
| Transliteration | ad |
| Pronunciation | ad |
| Part of Speech | masculine noun |
| BLB Count | 49 |

**Definition (Strong's/BDB):**
> "Properly, a (peremptory) terminus, i.e. (by implication) duration, in the sense of advance or perpetuity (substantially as a noun, either with or without a preposition): eternity, ever(-lasting, -more), old, perpetually, world without end."

**Root note:** From H5710 (to advance). The word ad signifies a terminal point that keeps advancing — a perpetual "until." This differs subtly from olam (concealed/vanishing point): ad emphasizes advance toward a terminus, olam emphasizes the distant horizon.

### KJV Rendering Statistics

| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| for ever | 25 | 49.0% |
| and ever | 14 | 27.5% |
| for | 3 | 5.9% |
| everlasting | 2 | 3.9% |
| old | 1 | 2.0% |
| evermore | 1 | 2.0% |
| ever | 1 | 2.0% |
| them for ever | 1 | 2.0% |
| eternity | 1 | 2.0% |
| perpetually | 1 | 2.0% |
| **Total** | **51** | ~100% |

### Key Occurrences

- **Gen 49:26** (blessings to "the utmost bound of the everlasting hills") — ad of hills
- **Exo 15:18** (LORD reigns "for ever and ever" — le-olam wa-ed) — compound with olam
- **Isa 9:6** (Everlasting Father = avi-ad, Father of perpetuity)
- **Isa 57:15** (inhabits "eternity" — ad, not olam)
- **Hab 3:6** ("everlasting mountains" = harrei-ad — scattered by God)
- **Dan 12:3** (wise shine "for ever and ever" = olam wa-ad)
- **Amos 1:11** (Edom's anger "for ever" = ad, alongside netsach)

### Critical Observation

Ad in Hab 3:6: "harrei-ad" (mountains of ad) are **scattered/destroyed** when God acts. Ad applied to the mountains does NOT make them imperishable. God's power can destroy what is described as ad. This exactly parallels olam in the same verse (giv'ot olam = hills of olam — they bow down). The temporal descriptor does not create ontological indestructibility.

## 3. H5331 — Netsach (נֶצַח)

### Full Lexicon Data

| Field | Data |
|-------|------|
| Strong's | H5331 |
| Hebrew | נֶצַח (also נֵצַח) |
| Transliteration | netsach |
| Pronunciation | neh-tsakh |
| Part of Speech | masculine noun |
| BLB Count | 43 |

**Definition (Strong's/BDB):**
> "Properly, a goal, i.e. the bright object at a distance travelled towards; hence (figuratively), splendor, or (subjectively) truthfulness, or (objectively) confidence; but usually (adverbially), continually (i.e. to the most distant point of view): alway(-s), constantly, end, (n-)ever(more), perpetual, strength, victory."

**Note:** Netsach is more semantically complex than olam — it can mean "victory" (1 Sam 15:29: the "Strength/Victory of Israel"), "splendor" (1 Chr 29:11), or temporal "perpetuity." The temporal sense is the adverbial use.

### KJV Rendering Statistics

| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| for ever | 21 | 47.7% |
| perpetual | 3 | 6.8% |
| never | 3 | 6.8% |
| always | 2 | 4.5% |
| ever | 2 | 4.5% |
| the Strength | 1 | 2.3% |
| and the victory | 1 | 2.3% |
| victory | 1 | 2.3% |
| *Other renderings* | ~10 | ~23% |
| **Total** | **44** | ~100% |

### Key Occurrences

- **1 Sam 15:29** (Netsach Yisrael = "the Strength of Israel will not lie")
- **Ps 13:1** ("How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? **for ever** [la-netsach]?") — rhetorical
- **Ps 49:9** (a man cannot "live for ever" and not see corruption) — mortal limitation
- **Isa 25:8** (death swallowed up "in victory/for ever" [la-netsach]) — God's act
- **Isa 34:10** ("for ever and ever" = le-netsach netsachim — Edom desolate, animals dwell there)
- **Lam 3:18** ("My strength and my hope is perished") — despair using netsach
- **Amos 1:11** (Edom's anger perpetually — la-netsach)
- **Amos 8:7** (LORD will "never" [la-netsach] forget — permanent memory)
- **Jer 50:39** (Babylon desolate "for ever" — la-netsach)

### Critical Observation

Isa 34:10 uses netsach netsachim (le-netsach netsachim) as the intensified compound, parallel to le-olam wa-ed. This compound is applied to Edom's desolation, but the context (vv.11-17) describes animals dwelling there — not ongoing combustion. The intensified compound does not change the fundamental nature of what is described.

## 4. H8548 — Tamid (תָּמִיד)

### Full Lexicon Data

| Field | Data |
|-------|------|
| Strong's | H8548 |
| Hebrew | תָּמִיד |
| Transliteration | tamid |
| Pronunciation | taw-meed |
| Part of Speech | masculine noun/adverb |
| BLB Count | 104 |

**Definition (Strong's/BDB):**
> "From an unused root meaning to stretch; properly, continuance (as indefinite extension); but used only (attributively as adjective) constant (or adverbially, constantly); elliptically the regular (daily) sacrifice: alway(-s), continual (employment, -ly), daily, (n-)ever(-more), perpetual."

### KJV Rendering Statistics

| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| continually | 53 | 50.5% |
| the continual | 17 | 16.2% |
| continual | 9 | 8.6% |
| the daily | 7 | 6.7% |
| always | 6 | 5.7% |
| alway | 4 | 3.8% |
| perpetual | 2 | 1.9% |
| ever | 2 | 1.9% |
| *Other* | ~4 | ~4% |
| **Total** | **105** | ~100% |

### Distinction from Olam

Tamid describes **regularity within a system** — the daily/continual sacrifice, the continual fire, the continual showbread. It is NOT the same as olam (time out of mind). Tamid can be abolished (Dan 8:11: "the daily was taken away"), whereas olam describes a more fundamental temporal quality.

Key Daniel texts:
- Dan 8:11: tamid is "taken away" — it has an end
- Dan 12:11: "from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away" + "1290 days" — tamid is measured in days

**Relationship to Olam:** When both tamid and olam appear in adjacent contexts (e.g., 2 Chr 7:16: "for ever... perpetually"), tamid adds the dimension of ongoing regularity while olam adds the dimension of permanent/indefinite duration. They are complementary, not synonymous.

## 5. H5957 — Alam (עָלַם) — Aramaic Cognate

### Full Lexicon Data

| Field | Data |
|-------|------|
| Strong's | H5957 |
| Aramaic | עָלַם |
| Transliteration | alam |
| Pronunciation | aw-lam |
| Part of Speech | masculine noun |
| BLB Count | 20 |

**Definition (Strong's/BDB):**
> "Corresponding to H5769; remote time, i.e. the future or past indefinitely; often adverb, forever: for (n-)ever (lasting), old."

The Aramaic cognate of Hebrew olam — same root, same range. Used in Daniel's Aramaic sections.

### KJV Rendering Statistics

| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| for ever | 8 | 40.0% |
| ever | 4 | 20.0% |
| everlasting | 4 | 20.0% |
| old | 2 | 10.0% |
| never | 1 | 5.0% |
| and ever | 1 | 5.0% |
| **Total** | **20** | 100% |

### Key Occurrences

- **Dan 2:4,44** ("O king, live for ever" = la-alam = conventional courtly greeting, not literal infinite life)
- **Dan 3:9** (same formulaic greeting)
- **Dan 5:10** (same formulaic greeting to Belshazzar)
- **Dan 6:6** (same formulaic greeting)
- **Dan 7:14,18,27** (everlasting kingdom = malchut olam — for God's/Messiah's kingdom)
- **Dan 12:7** (the one who lives "for ever" — God)

**Critical observation:** The conventional courtly greeting "O king, live for ever" (Dan 2:4; 3:9; 5:10; 6:6) uses the Aramaic alam and means "long live the king" — nobody expected these kings to live literally forever. This confirms the semantic range: alam/olam used in a clearly conventional/hyperbolic sense without literal infinite duration.

## 6. G165 — Aion (αἰών) — Greek NT

### Full Lexicon Data

| Field | Data |
|-------|------|
| Strong's | G165 |
| Greek | αἰών |
| Transliteration | aion |
| Pronunciation | ahee-ohn |
| Part of Speech | masculine noun |
| BLB Count | 128 |

**Definition (Strong's):**
> "Properly, an age; by extension, perpetuity (also past); by implication, the world; specially (Jewish) a Messianic period (present or future): age, course, eternal, (for) ever(-more), (n-)ever, (beginning of the, while the) world (began, without end)."

### KJV Rendering Statistics

| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| ever | 42 | 38.5% |
| world | 30 | 27.5% |
| and ever | 20 | 18.3% |
| evermore | 3 | 2.8% |
| the world began | 2 | 1.8% |
| ages | 2 | 1.8% |
| eternal | 2 | 1.8% |
| worlds | 2 | 1.8% |
| course | 1 | 0.9% |
| *Other rare* | ~5 | ~5% |
| **Total** | **109** | ~100% |

### LXX Connection

G165 is the primary Greek translation of H5769 (olam) in the LXX: 287 occurrences (PMI 5.55, score 31.41). This is the dominant correspondence — over half the uses of aion in the LXX/NT context trace to Hebrew olam.

### Key NT Applications

In the NT, aion is used for:
- "This age" / "the coming age" — temporal ages/periods (Matt 12:32; 13:22,39; 24:3)
- "For ever" (eis tous aionas) — in doxologies applied to God (Rom 1:25; 9:5; 11:36; 16:27)
- "For ever and ever" (eis tous aionas ton aionon) — extended compound (Gal 1:5; Rev 1:6; 4:9; etc.)
- "The world began" (pro chronon aionion = "before eternal times" — 2 Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2)

### Key Observation

The KJV translates aion as "world" 30 times — confirming that even in NT Greek usage, aion can mean "age/era/world" rather than "infinite time." This parallels olam = "world" in Ecc 3:11.

## 7. G166 — Aionios (αἰώνιος) — Greek NT

### Full Lexicon Data

| Field | Data |
|-------|------|
| Strong's | G166 |
| Greek | αἰώνιος |
| Transliteration | aionios |
| Pronunciation | ahee-o-nee-os |
| Part of Speech | adjective |
| BLB Count | 71 |

**Definition (Strong's):**
> "Perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well): eternal, for ever, everlasting, world (began)."

### KJV Rendering Statistics

| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| eternal | 19 | 39.6% |
| everlasting | 13 | 27.1% |
| of eternal | 7 | 14.6% |
| of everlasting | 1 | 2.1% |
| since the world began | 1 | 2.1% |
| with everlasting | 1 | 2.1% |
| the world began | 1 | 2.1% |
| the world | 1 | 2.1% |
| for ever | 1 | 2.1% |
| the eternal | 1 | 2.1% |
| *Other* | 2 | ~4% |
| **Total** | **48** | ~100% |

### LXX Connection

G166 is the secondary Greek translation of H5769 (olam) in the LXX: 100 occurrences (PMI 5.67, score 26.16). The slightly higher PMI (5.67 vs 5.55 for G165) indicates that when G166 is used, it is a *more specific* indicator of H5769 in the Hebrew, even though it appears fewer times.

### Key NT Punishment Applications

- Matt 25:41: "everlasting fire" (pur to aionion)
- Matt 25:46: "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion) / "life eternal" (zoen aionion)
- Mark 3:29: "eternal damnation" (aioniou kriseos)
- 2 Thess 1:9: "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion)
- Heb 6:2: "eternal judgment" (kriteos aionios)
- Heb 9:12: "eternal redemption" (lutrosis aionios)
- Rev 14:6: "the everlasting gospel" (euangelion aionion)

### Critical Observation

Aionios carries the SAME semantic range as olam because the LXX translators used it to translate olam. The key exegetical question for NT punishment texts (Matt 25:46, 2 Th 1:9) is: does aionios mean "infinite in duration" or "of the age/belonging to the age to come"?

The OT evidence: olam in punishment contexts (Isa 34:10, Jer 51:39, Dan 12:2) describes:
- The permanence of the judgment's RESULT (Isa 34:10 → desolate land, animals dwell there)
- The permanent sleep of death (Jer 51:39,57 → "perpetual sleep, and not wake")
- Both life AND contempt with the identical construct (Dan 12:2 → same olam for both outcomes)

The OT provides no example of olam in a punishment context requiring ongoing conscious experience as the mechanism. The "olam" quality is consistently the permanence of the final state (destruction/ruin/shame), not the ongoing nature of an experience.

---

## 8. Key Observations — Synthesis of Word Study Data

### 1. BDB/Strong's Core Definition

Olam = "properly, concealed, i.e. the vanishing point." Not "infinite" by definition. The word points to the far horizon of time, in either direction. Duration is determined by context.

### 2. The 40 KJV Translations of H5769

H5769 is rendered 40 different ways in the KJV — from "long home" (Ecc 12:5, = death) to "from everlasting" (Ps 90:2, = before creation). This range confirms the context-dependent nature of the word.

### 3. The Habakkuk 3:6 Test Case

A single verse contains:
- Ad (H5703) applied to mountains that are **scattered**
- Olam (H5769) applied to hills that **bow down**
- Olam (H5769) applied to God's ways that **endure**

Identical temporal vocabulary applied to subjects of radically different durability. The word itself does not determine whether the thing described is permanent or temporary — the nature of the subject and context does.

### 4. The LXX Bridge

H5769 → G165 (287x, PMI 5.55) and H5769 → G166 (100x, PMI 5.67)

This means: every time a NT text uses aion or aionios in a punishment context, the Hebrew OT background is olam — with all of olam's context-dependent range. The NT authors were not importing a "definitely infinite" concept from Greek philosophy; they were using the LXX vocabulary that corresponded to Hebrew olam.

### 5. Compound Intensifiers Do Not Change the Semantic Category

Le-olam wa-ed (for ever and ever) and le-netsach netsachim (for ever and ever):
- Applied to God's reign: infinite (Exo 15:18)
- Applied to the righteous shining: infinite (Dan 12:3)
- Applied to Edom's desolation: permanent-in-result, but animals dwell there (Isa 34:10)
- Applied to the wicked's name: permanently blotted out (Ps 9:5)

The compound intensifier amplifies the olam quality of the statement; it does not convert a finite/limited application into an infinite one.

### 6. The Dan 12:2 Symmetry

Both "everlasting life" and "everlasting contempt" use identical grammatical construction:
- le-chayyei olam (to life of eternity)
- le-dir'on olam (to abhorrence of eternity)

The dir'on (abhorrence/contempt) in Dan 12:2 is the exact word used in Isa 66:24 for the state of CORPSES. If the analysis agent wants to determine the nature of the "everlasting contempt," the OT provides a direct lexical clue: dir'on = the condition of dead bodies that are an abhorring. The olam quality = the permanence of this condition.
