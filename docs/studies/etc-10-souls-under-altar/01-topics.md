# ETC5 Study 10 — Souls Under the Altar (Rev 6:9-11)

## Question
What does Revelation 6:9-11 mean by "souls under the altar" crying out "How long?" Does this passage prove conscious existence between death and resurrection? Does it prove eternal conscious torment? What is the literary genre of Revelation? What is the meaning of the altar imagery, the white robes, and the command to "rest yet for a little season"?

### MARTYRDOM

**Source:** Nave's Topical Bible — topic [M] MARTYRDOM

**General scriptures concerning:**
PSA 44:22; MAT 10:21,22,39; 16:25; 23:34,35; 24:9; MRK 13:12; LUK 9:24; 11:50; 21:16,17; JHN 12:25; ROM 8:36; 1CO 13:3; REV 6:9-11; 11:7-12; 12:11; 16:6; 17:6

**See:** PERSECUTION

**INSTANCES OF:**
- Abel — GEN 4:3-8
- Prophets killed by Jezebel — 1KI 18:4,13
- Zechariah — 2CH 24:21,22
- John the Baptist — MRK 6:18-28
- Jesus — See JESUS
- Stephen — ACT 7:58-60
- James the apostle — ACT 12:2
- The prophets — MAT 22:6; 23:35; ROM 11:3; 1TH 2:15; HEB 11:32-37

**Analytical notes:**
- Rev 6:9-11 is listed under the general "martyrdom" heading, alongside passages throughout Revelation (11:7-12; 12:11; 16:6; 17:6). This confirms the passage is understood as a martyrdom passage.
- Abel is listed as the first instance of martyrdom, linking directly to the Gen 4:10 blood-crying pattern.
- The prophets killed by Jezebel, Zechariah (2 Chr 24:22 — "The LORD look upon it and require it"), and NT martyrs (Stephen, James) all belong to the same witness-testimony category as the souls of Rev 6:9.

- **Seen in John's vision — REV 8:3; 9:13**

**Analytical notes:**
- Nave's treats the Rev 6:9 altar as the same golden altar of incense seen in Rev 8:3; 9:13 — the heavenly counterpart to the tabernacle/temple altar.
- The altar of burnt offering (brazen altar) received blood at its base (Lev 4:7,18,25,30; Exo 29:12). The altar of incense (golden altar) is where prayers ascend (Rev 8:3-4). John's vision combines both: the martyrs' blood/life is under the altar (like blood poured at the base of the brazen altar), while their prayers/cries ascend like incense.
- Cross-reference to BLOOD is explicit in Nave's — meaning the altar and blood passages must be read together.

### BLOOD

**Source:** Nave's Topical Bible — topic [B] BLOOD

**Is the life:**
GEN 9:4; LEV 17:11,14; 19:16; DEU 12:23; MAT 27:4,24

**Forbidden to be used as food:**
GEN 9:4; LEV 3:17; 7:26,27; 17:10-14; 19:26; DEU 12:16,23; 15:23; EZK 33:25; ACT 15:20,29; 21:25

**SACRIFICIAL:**
- Without shedding of, no remission — HEB 9:22
- Sprinkled on altar and people — EXO 24:6-8; EZK 43:18,20
- **OF SIN OFFERING — Sprinkled seven times before the curtain — LEV 4:5,6,17**

- **Of the bullock of sin offering, put on the horns of the altar — EXO 29:12; LEV 8:15**
- **Poured at the bottom of the altar — EXO 29:12; LEV 8:15**
- See OFFERINGS

**FIGURATIVE:**
- Of victories — PSA 58:10
- Of oppression and cruelty — HAB 2:12
- Of destruction — EZK 35:6
- Of guilt — LEV 20:9; 2SA 1:16; EZK 18:13
- **Of judgments — EZK 16:38; REV 16:6**

**OF SACRIFICES, TYPICAL OF THE ATONING BLOOD OF CHRIST:** HEB 9:6-28

**OF CHRIST:**
MAT 26:28; MRK 14:24; LUK 22:20; JHN 6:53-56; ACT 20:28; ROM 3:24,25; 5:9; 1CO 10:16; EPH 1:7; 2:13,16; COL 1:14,20; HEB 9:12-14; 10:19,20,29; **12:24**; 13:12,20; 1PE 1:2,18,19; 1JN 1:7; 5:6,8; REV 1:5,6; 5:9; 7:14; 12:11

**Analytical notes:**
- Nave's explicitly states "blood is the life" (Lev 17:11,14; Gen 9:4; Deu 12:23) — this is the governing identification that governs "souls under the altar" (psychē = nephesh = blood-life = life force).
- The "poured at the bottom of the altar" entries (Lev 4:7,18,25,30; Exo 29:12) are listed under sacrificial blood ritual. This is the direct OT background for Rev 6:9.
- Nave's notes blood used "figuratively of judgments" — reinforcing the figurative/apocalyptic reading.
- Heb 12:24 is listed under "blood of Christ" — the blood of sprinkling that "speaketh better things than Abel." This explicitly links the Rev 6:9 martyrs to the Abel pattern.

### PATIENCE

**Source:** Nave's Topical Bible — topic [P] PATIENCE

**General scriptures concerning:**
PSA 37:7-9; PRO 15:18; ECC 7:8,9; LAM 3:26,27; LUK 8:15; 21:19; ROM 2:7; 5:3,4; 8:25; 12:12; 15:4,5; 1CO 13:4,5; 2CO 6:4-6; 12:12; GAL 6:9; EPH 4:1,2; COL 1:10,11; 3:12,13; 1TH 1:3; 5:14; 2TH 3:5; 1TI 3:2,3; 6:11; 2TI 2:24,25; TIT 2:1,2,9; HEB 6:12,15; 10:36; 12:1; JAS 1:3,4,19; 5:7,8; 1PE 2:19-23; 2PE 1:5,6; **REV 1:9; 13:10; 14:12**

**See also:** LONGSUFFERING, MEEKNESS

**INSTANCES OF:**
- Isaac toward the people of Gerar — GEN 26:15-22
- Moses — EXO 16:7,8
- Job — JOB 1:21; JAS 5:11
- David — PSA 40:1
- Paul — 2TI 3:10
- The prophets — JAS 5:10
- **The congregation at Ephesus — REV 2:2,3**
- **The congregation at Thyatira — REV 2:19**
- **John — REV 1:9**

**Analytical notes:**
- Revelation 13:10 and 14:12 are key: the saints called to "patience" (hupomone) in the context of persecution and martyrdom. The "patience" commanded in Rev 6:11 ("rest yet for a little season") echoes the same concept in 13:10 and 14:12.
- Heb 10:36 ("For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise") and Heb 12:1 ("run with patience the race set before us") are in the same semantic domain as the souls' waiting period in Rev 6:11.
- "The patient endurance of Job" (Jas 5:11) is an example of waiting under affliction until divine vindication — the same narrative pattern as the souls under the altar waiting for the day of judgment.

### RESURRECTION

**Source:** Nave's Topical Bible — topic [R] RESURRECTION

**General scriptures concerning:**
JOB 14:12-15; 19:25-27; PSA 16:9,10; 17:15; 49:15; ISA 25:8; 26:19; EZK 37:1-14; **DAN 12:2,3,13**; HOS 13:14; MAT 22:23-32; 24:31; 25:1-13; 27:52,53; MRK 12:18-27; LUK 14:14; 20:27-38; JHN 5:21,25,28,29; 6:39,40,44,54; 11:23-25; 14:19; ACT 2:26-31; 4:1,2; 17:18,32; 23:6,8; 24:14,15; 26:6-8; ROM 4:16-21; 8:10,11,19,21-23; 1CO 6:14; **15:12-32,35-57**; 2CO 4:14; 5:1-5; PHP 3:10,11,21; **1TH 4:14,16**; 2TI 1:10; 2:18; HEB 6:2; 11:19,35; REV 1:18; **20:4-6,13**

**FIGURATIVE:**
- Of regeneration — ROM 6:4; EPH 2:1,5,6; COL 2:12; 3:1

**TYPIFIED:**
- Isaac — GEN 22:13; with HEB 11:19
- Jonah — JON 2:10; with MAT 12:40

**SYMBOLICAL:** REV 11:11

**Analytical notes:**
- Nave's lists Rev 20:4-6,13 as the primary resurrection passage, with the same group of martyrs who appear in Rev 6:9. This confirms that the "first resurrection" of Rev 20:4-6 is the moment the martyrs of Rev 6:9 "live."
- Dan 12:2,3,13 is listed — connecting to "rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days" (Dan 12:13). This is the rest → resurrection pattern.
- Job 14:12-15 is listed: "man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake... thou wilt call, and I will answer thee." This is a direct parallel to the souls of Rev 6:9 waiting until the resurrection.
- 1 Thess 4:14,16 is listed: "the dead in Christ shall rise first" — the resurrection is the moment of vindication, not any intermediate state.

### DEAD (PEOPLE)

**Source:** Nave's Topical Bible — topic [D] DEAD (PEOPLE)

**Raised to life:** (see HEB 11:35)

**INSTANCES OF:**
- Son of the widow of Zarephath — 1KI 17:17-23
- The Shunammite woman's son — 2KI 4:32-37
- Elisha's grave miracle — 2KI 13:21
- The widow's son — LUK 7:12-15
- Jairus' daughter — LUK 8:49-55
- Lazarus — JHN 11:43,44
- Dorcas — ACT 9:37-40
- Eutychus — ACT 20:9-12

**Burial customs:**
- Prepared by washing — ACT 9:37
- Anointing — MAT 26:12
- Wrapping in linen — MAT 27:59
- Burnings of incense made for — 2CH 16:14; JER 34:5

**UNCLASSIFIED SCRIPTURES RELATING TO:**
JOB 3:13-19; 14:11-15,21; 17:13-16; **PSA 6:5; 30:9; 49:15; 88:10-12; 115:17**; PRO 21:16; **ECC 9:5,6**; EZK 32:31; **DAN 12:2**; LUK 9:30,31; 16:19-31; 20:35,36; 23:43; JHN 11:25

**See also:** BURIAL, DEATH, MOURNING, RESURRECTION, RIGHTEOUS PROMISES TO, WICKED PUNISHMENT OF

**Analytical notes:**
- Nave's "unclassified" list for the dead includes Ecc 9:5,6 (dead know nothing) and Psa 88:10-12 (no lovingkindness in the grave?) together with Dan 12:2 and Psa 115:17 (dead praise not the LORD). These are Nave's own cross-references showing the state-of-the-dead passages belong to the same topic cluster.
- Job 3:13-19 describes the dead: "There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest." Job 14:11-15,21 states that man "lieth down and riseth not... his sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not." This is directly relevant to the consciousness question.
- Luke 16:19-31 (Rich man and Lazarus) is listed here — the same passage studied in etc5-09. Its listing alongside Ecc 9:5,6 and Psa 115:17 suggests Nave's treats it as part of the same topic cluster without forcing a doctrinal resolution.

### AVENGER OF BLOOD (referenced in PROMPT.md)
Nave's references: GEN 9:5,6; NUM 35:19-29; DEU 19:4-13; JOS 20:1-9

- The OT "avenger of blood" (go'el haddam) was the kinsman whose duty was to execute justice on behalf of the slain. God himself takes this role in Deu 32:43 ("he will avenge the blood of his servants") and Rev 19:2 (fulfillment).
- The "How long?" cry of Rev 6:10 echoes the same blood-avenging framework: the martyrs' blood cries for a go'el, and God ultimately fulfills this role at the final judgment.
