| heartily | 1 | 1.1% |
| of soul | 1 | 1.1% |
| of the soul | 1 | 1.1% |
| minds | 1 | 1.1% |

### Key Observations
- Greek equivalent of Hebrew nephesh (H5315)
- Translated "life" nearly as often as "soul" -- the word means "life" or "the living being"
- In Rev 6:9, psychas = "souls" = the lives/blood of the slain
- In Rev 20:4, psychas = "souls" of beheaded martyrs -- same word, same group
- In Rev 12:11, psychas = "lives" ("loved not their lives unto the death")
- In Rev 16:3, "every living soul died" (psyche = living creature)
- The word is used for animals in Rev 8:9 ("the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life [psyche], died")

### Key Verses in Revelation
- Rev 6:9 -- "the souls [psychas] of them that were slain"
- Rev 12:11 -- "they loved not their lives [psychas] unto the death"
- Rev 16:3 -- "every living soul [psyche] died in the sea"
- Rev 18:13 -- merchandise includes "slaves, and souls [psychas] of men"
- Rev 20:4 -- "the souls [psychas] of them that were beheaded"

### LXX Connection
The LXX uses psyche to translate nephesh throughout the OT. The nephesh-blood equation (Lev 17:11,14; Gen 9:4; Deu 12:23) carries into the NT: psyche = nephesh = blood = life.

**Transliteration:** thysiastērion
**Pronunciation:** thoo-see-as-tay-ree-on
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun

### Translations (22 occurrences, 3 unique translations)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| altar | 20 | 90.9% |
| altars | 1 | 4.5% |
| an altar | 1 | 4.5% |

### Key Observations
- Derived from thysia (sacrifice) -- etymologically a "sacrifice-place"
- Used for both the OT altar (Mat 23:35; Luk 11:51; 1Co 9:13; Heb 7:13) and the heavenly altar in Revelation
- In Rev 6:9, the souls are "under the altar" -- corresponding to the OT blood poured at the base/bottom of the altar (Lev 4:7,18,25,30)
- In Rev 8:3, the golden altar is connected with the prayers of the saints
- In Rev 16:7, the altar itself speaks ("I heard another out of the altar say") -- personification

### Revelation Occurrences
- Rev 6:9 -- souls under the altar
- Rev 8:3 -- angel at the altar with incense/prayers
- Rev 8:5 -- fire of the altar cast to earth
- Rev 9:13 -- voice from the four horns of the golden altar

## G4969 -- sphazō (σφάζω)
**Original:** σφάζω
**Transliteration:** sphazō
**Pronunciation:** sfad-zo
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** A primary verb; to butcher (especially an animal for food or in sacrifice)

### Translations (8 occurrences, 7 unique translations)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| that were slain | 2 | 25.0% |
| it had been slain | 1 | 12.5% |
| thou wast slain | 1 | 12.5% |
| that was slain | 1 | 12.5% |
| they should kill | 1 | 12.5% |
| wounded | 1 | 12.5% |
| slain | 1 | 12.5% |

### Key Observations
- A sacrificial/butchering term -- not a general word for killing
- Used ONLY 8 times in the NT, concentrated in Revelation and 1 John
- Creates a shared sacrificial vocabulary between the Lamb and the martyrs:
  - **The Lamb:** Rev 5:6 ("as it had been slain"), Rev 5:9 ("thou wast slain"), Rev 5:12 ("the Lamb that was slain")
  - **The martyrs:** Rev 6:9 ("them that were slain"), Rev 18:24 ("all that were slain upon the earth")
  - **Abel:** 1 Jn 3:12 ("slew his brother")
  - **The beast:** Rev 13:3 ("wounded to death" -- same word, parodying the Lamb)
  - **General:** Rev 6:4 ("they should kill one another")

### Significance
The use of the same word (sphazō) for both Christ and the martyrs places the martyrs in a sacrificial framework. Their deaths are presented as sacrificial offerings, paralleling the Lamb's sacrifice. This is consistent with the imagery of their blood/lives being found at the base of the altar.

## G2896 -- krazō (κράζω)
**Original:** κράζω
**Transliteration:** krazō
**Pronunciation:** krad-zo
**Part of Speech:** verb
**Definition:** A primary verb; properly, to "croak" (as a raven) or scream, i.e. (genitive case) to call aloud

### Translations (52 occurrences, 19 unique translations)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| cried | 13 | 25.0% |
| they cried out | 6 | 11.5% |
| crying | 6 | 11.5% |
| he cried | 5 | 9.6% |
| cried out | 5 | 9.6% |
| they cried | 2 | 3.8% |
| crying out | 2 | 3.8% |
| and cried | 2 | 3.8% |
| (other variants) | 11 | 21.2% |

### Key Observations
- A loud, urgent cry -- not ordinary speech
- Used in Rev 6:10 for the souls' cry: "they cried with a loud voice"
- The LXX uses krazō to translate Hebrew tsa'aq/za'aq -- the cry for justice
- Key parallel: **James 5:4** -- withheld wages "crieth" (same word family) -- the wages themselves cry, not a person (personification)
- Key parallel: **Genesis 4:10** -- Abel's blood "crieth" (LXX: krazō) from the ground
- Also used in Rev 7:2,10; 10:3; 12:2; 14:15; 18:18; 19:17

### Personification Pattern
The krazō word in Gen 4:10 (LXX) and Jas 5:4 establishes a pattern where non-personal subjects (blood, wages) "cry out" -- forensic/juridical testimony rather than literal vocalization. Rev 6:10 follows the same pattern.

### Translations (13 occurrences, 10 unique translations)
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| rest | 4 | 30.8% |
| will give [rest] | 1 | 7.7% |
| take thine ease | 1 | 7.7% |

### Key Observations
- Means to rest, repose, cease from activity, be refreshed
- Used in **Rev 6:11** -- "they should rest yet for a little season"
- Used in **Rev 14:13** -- "that they may rest from their labours"
- These two uses in Revelation describe the same condition: the dead in the Lord resting
- Compare with **Dan 12:13** (Hebrew nuach): "thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days" -- rest now, resurrection later
- The rest-then-resurrection pattern is consistent with death as unconscious sleep

### NT Occurrences
- Mat 11:28 -- "Come unto me... I will give you rest"
- Mat 26:45 / Mrk 14:41 -- "Sleep on now, and take your rest"
- Mrk 6:31 -- "Come ye yourselves... and rest a while"

### Key Observations
- Means to carry out justice, vindicate, avenge
- The martyrs' cry in **Rev 6:10** uses this word: "dost thou not judge and avenge [ekdikeis] our blood"
- The ANSWER to this cry comes in **Rev 19:2**: "hath avenged [exedikēsen] the blood of his servants at her hand" -- same word, completing the narrative arc
- The OT background: **Deu 32:43** -- "he will avenge the blood of his servants"

### NT Occurrences

### The Vindication Arc
Rev 6:10 (cry for vindication) --> Rev 16:5-7 (vindication affirmed by the altar) --> Rev 19:2 (vindication accomplished). The same word (ekdikeō) bookends this narrative arc.
