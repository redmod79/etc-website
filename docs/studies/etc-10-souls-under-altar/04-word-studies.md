# ETC5 Study 10 — Souls Under the Altar (Rev 6:9-11)

---

## 1. G5590 — psychē (ψυχή) — SOUL / LIFE

**Original:** ψυχή (psychē)
**Transliteration:** psychē
**Pronunciation:** psoo-khay
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**BLB Count:** 105 occurrences (NT = 87 direct NT uses; + LXX citations)

**Lexicon definition:**
"from [psucho — to breathe]; breath, i.e. (by implication) spirit, abstractly or concretely (the animal sentient principle only; thus distinguished on the one hand from pneuma, which is the rational and immortal soul; and on the other from zoe, which is mere vitality, even of plants)."

**Translation distribution (KJV, 87 NT occurrences):**
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| soul | 32 | 36.8% |
| life | 25 | 28.7% |
| souls | 18 | 20.7% |
| lives | 4 | 4.6% |
| other (mind, heart, heartily, etc.) | 8 | 9.2% |

**Key observation:** "Soul" and "life" together account for 65.5% of usages. "Mind," "heart," and other non-soul translations account for significant minority uses. The word is not a technical term exclusively meaning "conscious disembodied spirit."

**Hebrew background (H5315 — nephesh):**
The LXX regularly translates nephesh (H5315) as psychē. Nephesh covers: biological life (Gen 1:20 — living creatures in the sea), persons (Gen 46:26 — "souls that came into Egypt"), blood-life (Lev 17:11 — "the life is in the blood"), appetite (Isa 29:8), and corpse/dead body (Num 6:6 — "dead body" = nephesh mēt). The psychē/nephesh equivalence means psychē inherits the full semantic range of nephesh — including the possibility of death (Num 23:10 — "let my soul die") and body/corpse meaning.

### All 7 Occurrences of psychē in Revelation (Critical for this study)

**Rev 6:9** — "I saw under the altar the SOULS (tas psychas) of them that were slain for the word of God"
- Context: Fifth seal vision; martyrs under the altar
- Meaning: The lives/persons of the slain; most naturally = "the lives" poured out, given in sacrifice

**Rev 8:9** — "the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had LIFE (psychēn), died"
- Context: Second trumpet judgment, sea creatures dying
- Meaning: Biological life of sea creatures — NOT "disembodied spirits" (sea creatures do not have disembodied spirits)
- This usage proves psychē in Revelation = biological life, not necessarily conscious spirit

**Rev 12:11** — "they loved not their LIVES (psychas) unto the death"
- Context: Overcomers who conquer Satan by the Lamb's blood
- Meaning: Physical/biological lives they gave up in martyrdom
- Directly connects to Rev 6:9 — the same martyrs, the same psuchē vocabulary

**Rev 16:3** — "every LIVING SOUL (psychē zōsa) died in the sea"
- Context: Second bowl judgment, sea becomes blood
- Meaning: Every living creature in the sea — same as Rev 8:9
- Again: biological life of non-human creatures

**Rev 18:13** — "and SOULS (psychas) of men"
- Context: Babylon's commercial goods — listing slaves among merchandise
- Meaning: Persons, human beings as commodities (= nephesh in OT usage for counting persons)

**Rev 18:14** — "the fruits that thy SOUL (psychē) lusted after"
- Context: Babylon mourning loss of luxuries
- Meaning: Appetite, desire, longing — psychē = the desiring/wanting self

**Rev 20:4** — "I saw the SOULS (tas psychas) of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus"
- Context: Martyrs living and reigning with Christ; their "living" = first resurrection
- Meaning: The persons of the martyred; their "living" is explicitly identified as "the first resurrection"

**Summary of psychē in Revelation:**
- Biological life of sea creatures: 2x (8:9; 16:3)
- Physical life given up in martyrdom: 1x (12:11)
- Persons as commodities: 1x (18:13)
- Appetite/desire: 1x (18:14)
- Martyrs under/at the altar: 2x (6:9; 20:4)
- **Zero occurrences where psychē unambiguously means "conscious disembodied spirit"**

## 2. G2379 — thusiasterion (θυσιαστήριον) — ALTAR

**Original:** θυσιαστήριον (thusiasterion)
**Transliteration:** thysiastērion
**Pronunciation:** thoo-see-as-tay-ree-on
**Part of Speech:** neuter noun (n)
**BLB Count:** 23 occurrences

**Lexicon definition:**
"from a derivative of thysia (sacrifice); a place of sacrifice, i.e. an altar (of offering or of incense)"

**Etymology:** thysia (sacrifice) → thysiastērion (place of sacrifice). The word is built on "sacrifice" — it is the place where sacrifice occurs, not merely an incense table. The root connects directly to blood sacrifice.

**All NT occurrences (23 total, 7 in Revelation):**

*Non-Revelation NT:*
- Ex 30:1 (LXX cited) — golden altar of incense
- Matt 5:23; 23:18,19,20,35 — the altar in temple worship
- Luke 1:11; 11:51 — angel appeared at the altar; righteous blood shed
- Rom 11:3 — "they have digged down thine altars"
- 1 Cor 9:13; 10:18 — those who serve at the altar partake of the altar's food
- Heb 7:13; 13:10 — we have an altar
- James 2:21 — Abraham offered on the altar

*Revelation occurrences (all 7):*
- **Rev 6:9** — souls under the altar (hypokatō tou thusiastēriou)
- **Rev 8:3** — angel at the altar, golden censer, incense + prayers of saints
- **Rev 8:5** — angel filled censer with fire from the altar, cast to earth
- **Rev 9:13** — voice from the four horns of the golden altar
- **Rev 11:1** — measure the temple and the altar
- **Rev 14:18** — angel from the altar with power over fire
- **Rev 16:7** — "I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments"

**Critical observations:**
1. Rev 16:7 shows the altar itself "says" words — the altar is a non-conscious inanimate structure that speaks in Revelation's literary mode. This is the strongest evidence that speech attributed to entities under/at the altar in Revelation does not require consciousness.
2. The 7 Revelation occurrences form a coherent altar theology: the altar is the place of sacrifice (6:9), prayer/incense (8:3-4), judgment-initiation (8:5), voice of justice (9:13; 16:7), and harvest/reaping (14:18).
3. Matt 23:35 uses thusiasterion in connection with "righteous blood shed" — "the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar" — directly connecting altar + blood of martyrs, the same pairing as Rev 6:9.

## 3. G4969 — sphazo (σφάζω) — SLAIN / SLAUGHTER

**Original:** σφάζω (sphazo)
**Transliteration:** sphazo
**Pronunciation:** sfad-zo
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**BLB Count:** 10 occurrences (all in 1 John and Revelation)

**Lexicon definition:**
"a primary verb; to butcher (especially an animal for food or in sacrifice); figuratively to slaughter, or (specifically) to maim"

**All NT occurrences (10 total):**

*1 John:*
- **1 Jn 3:12** — "Cain... slew (esphaxen) his brother" — Abel's murder; this is the foundational Abel narrative

*Revelation (9 occurrences):*
- **Rev 5:6** — "a Lamb as it had been slain" (hōs esphagmenon) — perfect passive participle; the Lamb bears the marks of slaughter
- **Rev 5:9** — "thou wast slain" (esphagēs) — aorist passive; the Lamb was slaughtered
- **Rev 5:12** — "the Lamb that was slain" (to arnion to esphagmenon) — perfect passive participle
- **Rev 6:4** — "that they should kill one another" (hina allēlous sphaxousin) — future active
- **Rev 6:9** — "souls of them that were slain" (tōn esphagmenōn) — perfect passive participle, genitive plural
- **Rev 13:3** — "as it were wounded to death" (hōs esphagmenēn) — beast's head as if slaughtered
- **Rev 13:8** — "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (tou arniou tou esphagmenou)
- **Rev 18:24** — "all that were slain upon the earth" (panton tōn esphagmenōn)

**Theological significance of sphazō network:**
- The Lamb (Jesus) is sphazō'd — Rev 5:6,9,12; 13:8
- The martyrs in Rev 6:9 are sphazō'd — same word, same form
- Abel is sphazō'd — 1 Jn 3:12
- All the slain on earth are sphazō'd — Rev 18:24
- The beast mimics the Lamb in being "as if sphazō'd" — Rev 13:3

The network creates a sacrificial theology: the Lamb was slaughtered as a sacrifice; the martyrs were slaughtered in the same sacrificial mode. Their death is presented as analogous to the Lamb's death. The word sphazō is specifically a sacrificial slaughter term, reinforcing the altar-blood-sacrifice interpretation of Rev 6:9.

## 4. G373 — anapauo (ἀναπαύω) — REST

**Original:** ἀναπαύω (anapauo)
**Transliteration:** anapauō
**Pronunciation:** an-ap-ow-o
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**BLB Count:** 12 occurrences (in NT; + 2 LXX)

**Lexicon definition:**
"from ana (again) and pauo (to stop); (reflexively) to repose (literally or figuratively [be exempt], remain); by implication, to refresh"

**All occurrences:**

*LXX (cited by BLB):*
- Isaiah 11:2 — "the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him"
- Matthew 11:28 — "I will give you REST" (anapauō)
- Matthew 11:29 — "ye shall find REST (anapausin) unto your souls"

*NT occurrences:*
- **Matt 11:28** — "Come unto me... and I will give you REST (anapausō)"
- **Matt 26:45** — "Sleep on now, and take your REST" (anapauō — disciples in Gethsemane)
- **Mark 6:31** — "Come ye yourselves apart... and REST a while" (anapauō — Jesus to disciples)
- **Mark 14:41** — "Sleep on now, and take your REST" (anapauō — Gethsemane)
- **Luke 12:19** — "take thine ease (anapauō), eat, drink, and be merry" — rich fool
- **1 Cor 16:18** — "they have refreshed (anapauō) my spirit"
- **2 Cor 7:13** — "his spirit was refreshed (anapauō) by you all"
- **Phm 1:7** — "the bowels of the saints are refreshed (anapauō) by thee"
- **Phm 1:20** — "refresh (anapauō) my bowels in the Lord"
- **1 Pet 4:14** — "the spirit of glory and of God resteth (anapauō) upon you"
- **Rev 6:11** — "that they should REST (anapausontai) yet for a little season"
- **Rev 14:13** — "that they may REST (anapausontai) from their labours"

**Critical analysis of Rev 6:11 and Rev 14:13:**

Rev 6:11: "ἵνα ἀναπαύσωνται ἔτι χρόνον μικρόν"
- ἀναπαύσωνται: Aorist Middle Subjunctive, 3rd Plural — "that they might rest"
- The subjunctive with ἵνα ("in order that") expresses purpose: the purpose of the instruction is that they would rest for a little time
- The word is active/reflexive: they are told to rest, implying rest is the appropriate condition for the waiting period

Rev 14:13: "ἵνα ἀναπαύσωνται ἐκ τῶν κόπων αὐτῶν"
- Same verb form: ἀναπαύσωνται
- "REST from their labours" — death is framed as rest from labour
- The Spirit says this describes the state of "the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth"
- The dead are at REST — not crying, not active, not conscious of their labours — but resting from them

**If the souls under the altar were already consciously active (speaking, crying, interacting with God, receiving garments), the command to "rest yet for a little season" would be incoherent.** The "rest" command is sensible if the resting-state is the condition of the dead, and the vision represents their cry for justice before they rest.

**Dan 12:13 parallel:**
"thou shalt rest (nuach, H5117), and stand in thy lot at the end of the days"
- Rest → then stand at the end = death → then resurrection at the end
- The same sequence as Rev 6:11 ("rest yet for a little season, until... fulfilled") → Rev 20:4 (martyrs live at the first resurrection)

## 5. G1556 — ekdikeo (ἐκδικέω) — AVENGE / VINDICATE

**Original:** ἐκδικέω (ekdikeō)
**Transliteration:** ekdikeō
**Pronunciation:** ek-dik-eh-o
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**BLB Count:** 6 occurrences

**Lexicon definition:**
"from ekdikos (avenger/punisher); to vindicate, retaliate, punish: a(re-)venge"

**All 6 NT occurrences:**
1. **Luke 18:3** — "Avenge me of mine adversary" — widow's request to unjust judge
2. **Luke 18:5** — "I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me" — unjust judge's decision
3. **Rom 12:19** — "Avenge not yourselves... Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord"
4. **2 Cor 10:6** — "having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience" (Paul's apostolic authority)
5. **Rev 6:10** — "dost thou not judge and avenge (ekdikeis) our blood"
6. **Rev 19:2** — "he hath avenged (exedikēsen) the blood of his servants at her hand"

**The ekdikeo arc in Revelation:**
Rev 6:10 (cry: "how long until you avenge?") → Rev 19:2 (fulfillment: "he has avenged")

This is a conscious narrative arc within Revelation. The "avenge" of 6:10 is answered by the "avenged" of 19:2 — the vindication occurs at the final judgment/fall of Babylon, not in an intermediate state. The Luke 18:7-8 parallel ("shall not God avenge his own elect... he will avenge them speedily... when the Son of man cometh") confirms that the timing of vindication is at the second coming, not at death.

## 6. G5270 — hupokato (ὑποκάτω) — UNDER

**Original:** ὑποκάτω (hypokatō)
**Transliteration:** hypokatō
**Pronunciation:** hoop-ok-at-o
**Part of Speech:** Adverb (also functions as preposition)
**BLB Count:** 8 occurrences, 100% translated "under"

**Translation distribution:** 8/8 = "under" (no variation)

**All occurrences:**
- Matt 22:44 — "until I make thine enemies thy footstool" (under thy feet)
- Mark 6:11 — "shake off the dust under your feet"
- Mark 7:28 — "the dogs under the table eat"
- Luke 8:16 — "putteth it under a bed"
- John 1:50 — "I saw thee under the fig tree"
- Heb 2:8 — "thou hast put all things under his feet"
- **Rev 5:3** — "neither under the earth"
- **Rev 6:9** — "I saw UNDER (hypokatō) the altar the souls"

**Positional significance:**
hypokatō = "under" consistently. In Rev 6:9, it specifies the location of the souls as spatially beneath the altar — corresponding to the Levitical position of blood poured at the "bottom" (yesod = foundation/base) of the altar (Lev 4:7,18,25,30; Exo 29:12). The souls are positioned exactly where the sacrificial blood was poured in the Levitical system.

## 7. H5315 — nephesh (נֶפֶשׁ) — SOUL / LIFE

**Original:** נֶפֶשׁ (nephesh)
**Transliteration:** nephesh
**Pronunciation:** neh-fesh
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**BLB Count:** 753 occurrences (most common "soul" equivalent in OT)

**Lexicon definition:**
"from naphash (to breathe); properly, a breathing creature, i.e. animal of (abstractly) vitality; used very widely in a literal, accommodated or figurative sense (bodily or mental): any, appetite, beast, body, breath, creature, dead(-ly), desire, (dis-)contented, fish, ghost, greedy, he, heart(-y), (hath, jeopardy of) life (in jeopardy), lust, man, me, mind, mortally, one, own, person, pleasure, (her-, him-, my-, thy-) self, them (your)-selves, slay, soul, tablet, they, thing, (she) will, would have it."

**Critical semantic range:**
The nephesh CAN die:
- Num 23:10 — "Let me die (tamuth) the death of the righteous" — "Let my soul (nephesh) die"
- Judg 16:30 — "Let me die (tamuth) with the Philistines" — Samson
- Job 36:14 — "Their soul (nephesh) dieth in youth"
- Ezk 18:4 — "The soul that sinneth, IT shall die (tamuth)" (nephesh)
- Ezk 18:20 — "The soul that sinneth, it shall die"

The nephesh = blood equation:
- Lev 17:11 — "the life (nephesh) of the flesh is in the blood"
- Lev 17:14 — "the life (nephesh) of all flesh is the blood thereof"
- Gen 9:4 — "flesh with the life (nephesh) thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat"
- Deut 12:23 — "the blood is the life (nephesh)"

**Implication for Rev 6:9:**
The Greek psychē translates the Hebrew nephesh in the LXX. The nephesh = blood equation, established in Lev 17:11,14; Gen 9:4; Deut 12:23, means that "souls under the altar" (psychas hypokatō tou thusiastēriou) = "lifeblood at the base of the altar" — the natural fulfillment of the Levitical blood-at-the-altar pattern.

## 8. H1818 — dam (דָּם) — BLOOD

**Original:** דָּם (dam)
**Transliteration:** dām
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 391 occurrences

**Translation distribution (selected):**
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| the blood | 79 | 20.2% |
| blood | 75 | 19.2% |
| of blood | 20 | 5.1% |
| his blood | 18 | 4.6% |
| of the blood | 17 | 4.3% |
| bloody / bloodshed | 9 | 2.3% |

**Significance of "voice of bloods" in Gen 4:10:**
The Hebrew of Gen 4:10 reads: "qol demey akhikhā tso'aqim elay min-ha'adamah" — "the voice of bloods of your brother is crying to me from the ground."

Key observations:
- "Bloods" (demey) is PLURAL — a Hebrew idiom for violent bloodshed, murder, bloodguilt
- The plural of dam appears elsewhere for murder: Gen 9:6; Num 35:33; 2 Sam 16:8; Ezk 18:13
- The blood "cries" (tso'aqim — participle of tsa'aq, to cry/shout/cry for help) — the same verb used for Israel crying in Egypt (Exo 3:9), the cry of the oppressed
- Abel is dead. The blood is not a conscious entity. The blood "cries" in the juridical sense: it is evidence of murder demanding divine response.
- The same pattern governs Rev 6:10: the martyrs' blood/lives cry for divine justice.

**Connection to nephesh/psychē:**
Dam (blood) = nephesh (life) per Lev 17:11,14; Gen 9:4; Deut 12:23
Therefore: dam (blood crying from the ground in Gen 4:10) = nephesh (the murdered soul) = psychē (the "souls under the altar" in Rev 6:9)

The chain: blood crying (Gen 4:10) → souls under the altar crying (Rev 6:10) = the same literary-theological pattern applied in an apocalyptic register.

## 9. Stole (G4749) — White Robe

**Original:** στολή (stolē)
**BLB Count:** 8 occurrences
**Translation distribution:**
| Translation | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| robes | 4 |
| long clothing | 1 |
| garment | 1 |
| robe | 1 |
| long robes | 1 |

**Revelation occurrences:**
- Rev 6:11 — "white robes (stolē leukē) were given unto every one of them"
- Rev 7:9 — "clothed with white robes (stolas leukas)"
- Rev 7:13 — "which are arrayed in white robes (stolas leukas)"
- Rev 7:14 — "and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (the white robes = righteousness from Christ's sacrifice)
- Rev 22:14 — "Blessed are they that do his commandments (TR: wash their robes)" — inheritance language at the end of Revelation

**Companion word: leukos (G3022) = white**
- Used throughout Revelation for the whiteness of robes (3:4,5; 4:4; 6:2,11; 7:9,13,14; 19:11,14; 20:11)
- In Rev 19:8 the explanation is given explicitly: "the fine linen is the righteousness of saints"

**The white robe as symbolic:**
The white robe in Rev 6:11 is given to each soul — this is explicitly symbolic: it represents their righteous status before God (divine declaration of their martyrdom as faithful witness). Rev 19:8 provides the authoritative internal interpretation: white linen/garments = the righteousness of saints. Rev 7:14 adds: the whiteness comes from being "washed in the blood of the Lamb" — paradoxical language that marks this as symbolic throughout.
