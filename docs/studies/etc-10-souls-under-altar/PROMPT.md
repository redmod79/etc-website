## Series Context

This is study #10 in the etc series (The Final Fate of the Wicked). Prior studies have established:

- **etc-01** (What Is Man?): Man = dust + breath = living soul (Gen 2:7). Nephesh (H5315) shared with animals. Death reverses creation. Thoughts perish at death (Ps 146:4). Dead know nothing (Ecc 9:5). Death = sleep (7+ authors). God alone has immortality (1 Tim 6:16). Immortality put on at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54). Rev 6:9-11 classified Neutral per Tree 3 (apocalyptic genre, symbolic subjects).
- **etc-02** (Who Has Immortality?): God exclusively possesses athanasia. Mortals must seek/receive/put on immortality. Eternal life is conditional on Christ. Life vs. perish contrast (John 3:16).
- **etc-03** (What Does Death Mean?): Death = cessation, reversal of creation. Same vocabulary (thanatos/maveth) for all death types. Second death = lake of fire (Rev 20:14; 21:8).
- **etc-04** (State of the Dead): 19 explicit statements describe the dead as unconscious (8+ authors, 6+ books). 0 explicit statements describe the dead as conscious in a didactic context. All alleged conscious-intermediate-state passages (2 Cor 5:8, Phil 1:23, Luke 23:43, Luke 16:19-31, Rev 6:9-11, 1 Sam 28, Matt 17, 1 Pet 3:18-20) fail Tree 3 gates. Rev 6:9-11 classified Neutral: Gate 1 FAIL (symbolic entity in apocalyptic vision), Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic genre). Abel's blood parallel noted (Gen 4:10).
- **etc-05** (Four Hell Words): Sheol/hades = abode of all dead, characterized by unconsciousness. Gehenna = eschatological destruction (Isa 66:24 corpse-background). Hades distinct from lake of fire.
- **etc-06** (Destruction Vocabulary): Seven destruction words analyzed. All mean cessation, not ongoing torment. Destruction and torment vocabulary are distinct word families.
- **etc-07** (OT Olam): Olam does not inherently mean "endless"; duration determined by context/subject. OT "forever" fire/smoke language describes completed, irreversible judgments.
- **etc-08** (NT Aionios): Aionios does not inherently mean "eternal"; past-time uses prove contextual range. "Ages of ages" in Revelation echoes OT ended-judgment language.
- **etc-09** (Rich Man and Lazarus): Luke 16:19-31 is parabolic (9+ Plain indicators vs. 1 Contextually Clear). Vocabulary divergence (basanos/odunao, not basanizo). Stated teaching point: hearing Moses and the prophets.

### Prior-Iteration Conclusions for This Passage

**etc4-10** established: Rev 6:9-11 depicts martyrs' lifeblood poured at the base of the heavenly sacrifice altar, crying for vindication -- imagery from OT sacrificial system (Lev 4:7,18,25,30) and blood-crying-out motif (Gen 4:10; Heb 11:4; 12:24). Psychai (G5590) = nephesh = blood-life. Same sphazō (G4969) word for both the Lamb and the martyrs. "Rest" (anapauō, G373) same word as Rev 14:13. Martyrs' "living" located at the first resurrection (Rev 20:4-5). The altar itself "speaks" in Rev 16:7 (personification throughout).

**etc5-10** confirmed: Rev 6:9-11 is a visionary scene where personification is the governing literary mode. The crying follows the Gen 4:10 pattern (juridical/forensic testimony of shed blood, not literal vocalization). The "rest" command matches Rev 14:13. Martyrs "live" at the first resurrection (Rev 20:4-5). Passage classified Neutral (both sides accept textual facts; what they mean is inference).

## INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY

```
INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by ECT proponents, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by conditionalists, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says. Do not use editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," "honestly acknowledge," or "non-intuitive reading." Simply state what each passage says and what each side infers from it.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- Never use language like "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.
```

**CRITICAL for this study:** Tree 3 (E-Item Positional Classification) must be applied to every E-item. For Rev 6:9-11, the key gates are:
- **Gate 1 (Subject Gate):** Is the grammatical subject a literal human being? Automatic FAIL if subject is a symbolic entity in an apocalyptic vision.
- **Gate 3 (Genre Gate):** Is the passage didactic prose? Automatic FAIL if passage is an apocalyptic vision.

## Primary Verses to Analyze

### The Passage: Revelation 6:9-11

Retrieve and analyze these verses from KJV:
- **Rev 6:9** -- "And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held"
- **Rev 6:10** -- "And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
- **Rev 6:11** -- "And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled."

### The Abel's Blood Parallel

- **Gen 4:10** -- "And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground."
- **Gen 4:8** -- Context: Cain slays Abel
- **Heb 11:4** -- "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh."
- **Heb 12:24** -- "And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel."

### OT Sacrificial Altar Background

- **Lev 17:11** -- "For the life [nephesh] of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls"
- **Lev 17:14** -- "the life [nephesh] of all flesh is the blood thereof"
- **Gen 9:4** -- "flesh with the life [nephesh] thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat"
- **Deu 12:23** -- "the blood is the life [nephesh]"
- **Lev 4:7** -- blood poured at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering
- **Lev 4:18, 4:25, 4:30, 4:34** -- blood poured at the bottom of the altar (repeated for each sin offering)
- **Exo 29:12** -- blood poured at the bottom of the altar

### Blood-Crying / Vindication Theme

- **Gen 9:5** -- "surely your blood of your lives will I require"
- **Deu 32:43** -- "he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries"
- **Jas 5:4** -- withheld wages "crieth" (krazō, same root as Rev 6:10)
- **Mat 23:35** -- "all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel"
- **Luk 11:50-51** -- "the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required"

### Intra-Revelation Parallels (CRITICAL)

- **Rev 5:6** -- the Lamb "as it had been slain" (sphazō, same word as Rev 6:9)
- **Rev 5:9** -- "thou wast slain [sphazō], and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood"
- **Rev 5:12** -- "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain [sphazō]"
- **Rev 12:11** -- "they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives [psychas] unto the death"
- **Rev 14:13** -- "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord...that they may rest [anapauō] from their labours"
- **Rev 16:6** -- "they have shed the blood of saints and prophets"
- **Rev 16:7** -- "I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments" (THE ALTAR SPEAKS -- personification within same book)
- **Rev 17:6** -- "the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus"
- **Rev 18:24** -- "in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain [sphazō] upon the earth"
- **Rev 19:2** -- "hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand" (ANSWER to Rev 6:10 cry)
- **Rev 20:4-5** -- "I saw the souls [psychas] of them that were beheaded for the witness [martyrian] of Jesus, and for the word of God...and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection." (SAME GROUP, SAME VOCABULARY: psychas, martyria, logos tou Theou -- their "living" IS the first resurrection)

### The Seal Sequence Context

- **Rev 6:1-2** -- First seal: white horse (symbolic)
- **Rev 6:3-4** -- Second seal: red horse (symbolic)
- **Rev 6:5-6** -- Third seal: black horse (symbolic)
- **Rev 6:7-8** -- Fourth seal: pale horse; rider named Death; Hades follows (personification: Death and Hades as riders)
- **Rev 6:9-11** -- Fifth seal: souls under the altar
- **Rev 6:12-14** -- Sixth seal: sun becomes black, moon as blood, stars fall (cosmic symbols)

### Death-State Passages (for harmony/SIS comparison)

- **Ecc 9:5** -- "the dead know not any thing"
- **Ecc 9:10** -- "there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave"
- **Ps 146:4** -- "in that very day his thoughts perish"
- **Ps 115:17** -- "The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence"
- **Ps 6:5** -- "in death there is no remembrance of thee"
- **Job 14:21** -- "His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not"
- **Dan 12:13** -- "thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days" (rest-then-resurrection pattern)
- **1 Jn 3:12** -- Cain "slew [sphazō] his brother" (same word connecting Abel to Rev 6:9)
- **Ezek 18:4,20** -- "the soul [nephesh] that sinneth, it shall die" (nephesh/psyche is mortal)

### Personification Parallels (non-literal "speaking" of the dead or objects)

- **Isa 14:4,8-10** -- mashal (taunt-poem): rephaim "speak" in sheol; trees "rejoice"
- **Hab 2:11** -- "the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it"
- **Luk 19:40** -- "the stones would immediately cry out"

## Key Strong's Numbers

### From tool output:

- **G5590 (psyche)** -- 87 NT occurrences. Translated: "soul" (32x), "life" (25x), "souls" (18x), "lives" (4x), plus minor variants. The word means "life/soul" and is the Greek equivalent of nephesh. In Rev 6:9, psychas = the lives/blood of the slain.

- **G2379 (thysiastērion)** -- 22 NT occurrences. Translated: "altar" (20x), "altars" (1x), "an altar" (1x). From a derivative of thyo (to sacrifice). A place of sacrifice. In Rev 6:9, the heavenly altar under which the souls/lives are seen.

- **G4969 (sphazō)** -- 8 NT occurrences. Translated: "slain" (5x), "killed" (1x), "wounded" (1x), "kill" (1x). Used for: the Lamb slain (Rev 5:6,9,12), martyrs slain (Rev 6:9), all slain on earth (Rev 18:24), Abel slain (1 Jn 3:12), beast's head wounded (Rev 13:3). The shared vocabulary between the Lamb and the martyrs places both in a sacrificial framework.

- **G2896 (krazō)** -- 52 NT occurrences. Translated: "cried" (13x), "cried out" (11x), "crying" (8x), etc. A loud cry. In Rev 6:10, the souls "cried with a loud voice." Same root as Jas 5:4 where withheld wages "cry."

### Additional key terms to study:

- **G373 (anapauō)** -- "to rest, refresh." Used in Rev 6:11 ("rest yet for a little season") and Rev 14:13 ("rest from their labours"). Same word linking the martyrs' state to the blessed dead.
- **H5315 (nephesh)** -- "soul, life, living being." The Hebrew equivalent of G5590. Nephesh = blood (Lev 17:11,14; Gen 9:4; Deu 12:23). Nephesh can die (Ezek 18:4,20).
- **G1556 (ekdikeo)** -- "to avenge, vindicate." In Rev 6:10 ("avenge our blood") and Rev 19:2 ("hath avenged the blood").

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Genre Analysis (CRITICAL)
Analyze the genre of Revelation as apocalyptic literature. Document:
- Revelation is classified under VISION in Nave's Topical Bible
- The seal sequence (Rev 6) is filled with symbolic elements: four colored horses, Death and Hades personified as riders, cosmic upheaval
- Within the fifth seal itself, note that the fourth seal just had Death (personified) and Hades (personified) as horsemen -- the literary context is entirely symbolic
- Rev 16:7 has the altar itself speaking ("I heard another out of the altar say...") -- if the altar can "speak," the souls under the altar "crying" fits the same personification pattern
- Apply Tree 3 Genre Gate: Revelation is apocalyptic vision, not didactic prose

### 2. The Nephesh-Blood-Altar Connection
Analyze the OT background:
- Nephesh (H5315) / psyche (G5590) = blood = life (Lev 17:11,14; Gen 9:4; Deu 12:23)
- In the OT sacrificial system, the blood of the sacrifice was poured at the base/bottom of the altar (Lev 4:7,18,25,30; Exo 29:12)
- In Rev 6:9, John sees psychas (souls/lives) under the altar -- this is the blood-life poured at the altar base
- The martyrs are presented as sacrificial offerings (sphazō used for both them and the Lamb)

### 3. The Abel's Blood Parallel
Analyze Gen 4:10 as the interpretive key:
- Abel's blood "crieth" from the ground -- Abel is dead; his blood personified as having a voice
- Heb 11:4 -- Abel "being dead yet speaketh" -- through his faithful sacrifice, not through conscious disembodied existence
- Heb 12:24 -- the blood of Christ "speaketh" -- blood speaks as a literary/theological concept
- 1 Jn 3:12 -- Cain sphazō'd Abel (same word as Rev 6:9)
- The cry in Rev 6:10 is for the avenging of "our blood" -- they identify with their blood, not with disembodied consciousness

### 4. The Vindication Arc
Trace the narrative arc:
- Rev 6:10 -- cry: "How long...dost thou not judge and avenge our blood?"
- Rev 16:6 -- "they have shed the blood of saints and prophets"
- Rev 17:6 -- Babylon "drunken with the blood of the saints"
- Rev 18:24 -- "in her was found the blood of prophets and saints"
- Rev 19:2 -- ANSWER: "hath avenged the blood of his servants" (ekdikeo, same as Rev 6:10)
- Deu 32:43 -- OT promise: "he will avenge the blood of his servants"

### 5. The Rev 20:4-5 Connection (DECISIVE)
This is the same group described later:
- Rev 6:9: psychas... slain (sphazō)... for the word of God... for the testimony (martyria)
- Rev 20:4: psychas... beheaded for the witness (martyria) of Jesus and for the word of God
- SAME vocabulary: psychas, logos tou Theou, martyria
- Rev 20:4-5 states: "they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years... This is the first resurrection"
- The martyrs' "living" is explicitly located at the first resurrection, NOT in an intermediate state

### 6. The "Rest" Command
- Rev 6:11: told to "rest" (anapauō, G373) for a little season
- Rev 14:13: "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord...that they may rest [anapauō] from their labours"
- Dan 12:13: "thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days"
- The pattern: rest now, resurrection later -- consistent with death-as-unconsciousness passages

### 7. Tree 3 Application (MANDATORY)
Apply the full E-Item Positional Classification tree to Rev 6:9-11:
- Step 1 (Vocabulary Scan): V2 -- "cried with a loud voice" = conscious activity vocabulary. Candidate: ECT.
- Step 2 (Gate 1 -- Subject): The "souls" are in an apocalyptic vision. They are symbolic entities in a highly symbolic book. FAIL.
- Step 2 (Gate 3 -- Genre): Apocalyptic vision. FAIL.
- Step 3 (Reclassification): Corrected observation: "In an apocalyptic vision, John sees symbolic figures (souls under the altar) who cry out and are told to rest." Re-enter V1/V2: symbolic apocalyptic imagery does not constitute didactic teaching about the literal state of the dead. Parallel: Abel's blood "crieth" from the ground (Gen 4:10) without being literally conscious.
- Result: Neutral.

### 8. SIS Clarity Hierarchy
Apply the clarity criteria:
1. **Directness of vocabulary** -- Rev 6:9-11 uses apocalyptic vision imagery; the death-state passages use direct declarative statements
2. **Genre** -- Didactic > apocalyptic (per SIS methodology). The death-state passages (Ecc 9:5; Ps 146:4; Ps 115:17; etc.) are didactic. Rev 6:9-11 is apocalyptic vision. Didactic governs.
3. **Scope** -- The death-state passages make universal statements about the dead. Rev 6:9-11 describes a specific apocalyptic vision scene.
4. **Frequency** -- 8+ authors across 6+ books describe the dead as unconscious. Rev 6:9-11 is one passage in one apocalyptic vision.
5. **Self-interpretation** -- Rev 20:4-5 interprets the martyrs' "living" as the first resurrection (same group, same vocabulary).

## Cross-References

- etc-04 first analyzed Rev 6:9-11 as E39/E156 (Neutral) and I5/I026 (I-C ECT-direction)
- etc-09 analyzed the Abel's blood parallel (E30/E335) in context of Luke 16:19-31
- etc5-10 and etc4-10 provide detailed prior-iteration analysis (different methodology, but useful data)
- The Rev 6:9-11 analysis should be cross-referenced with the Rev 14:10-11 analysis (etc-11, upcoming) for the broader question of Revelation's eschatological imagery
