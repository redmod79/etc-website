### Revelation 6:1-17 — Full primary passage

Retrieved lines 30795-30811 from kjv.txt.

**Verse structure — seal sequence analysis:**
| Seal | Verse(s) | Content | Literary device |
|------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| First | 6:1-2 | White horse; rider conquering | Personification of conquest |
| Second | 6:3-4 | Red horse; peace taken from earth | Personification of war |
| Third | 6:5-6 | Black horse; economic distress | Symbol (balances = economic control) |
| Fourth | 6:7-8 | Pale horse; Death and Hades | **Death and Hades = personified abstractions** |
| Fifth | 6:9-11 | Souls under the altar | Sacrificial imagery / personification |
| Sixth | 6:12-17 | Cosmic catastrophe | Apocalyptic imagery (sun as sackcloth, stars falling) |

The fourth seal is the critical literary context: "his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him." Death and Hades are presented as personal beings riding a horse. This is explicit personification of abstract realities in the same vision sequence as the fifth seal's "crying souls."
