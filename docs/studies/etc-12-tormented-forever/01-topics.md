## Question

What does Revelation 20:10 mean by "tormented day and night for ever and ever"? Who are the specific named subjects? Is the explicit "tormented for ever and ever" formula applied to human beings or to supernatural entities (the devil, beast, false prophet)? Do other passages in Scripture describe ongoing conscious torment as the final state of human beings? How does the vocabulary of torment (basanizō/basanismos) relate to the vocabulary of destruction (apollumi/apoleia/olethros) when applied to the wicked?

### LAKE (of fire)

**Nave's entry:**
> "Of fire — REV 19:20; 20:10, 14, 15; 21:8"

**All 5 lake-of-fire references in Revelation:**
- **Rev 19:20** — beast and false prophet cast ALIVE into lake of fire burning with brimstone (first occurrence)
- **Rev 20:10** — devil cast into lake where beast and false prophet are; all three tormented day and night for ever and ever
- **Rev 20:14** — death and hades cast into lake = "the second death"
- **Rev 20:15** — whoever not found in book of life cast into lake
- **Rev 21:8** — lake burning with fire and brimstone = "the second death" (for eight categories of human sinners)

**Key structural observation:** The 5 occurrences of the lake of fire in Revelation involve three distinct sets of subjects:
1. Supernatural entities (beast, false prophet, devil) — Rev 19:20; 20:10
2. Conceptual/personified entities (death, hades) — Rev 20:14
3. Human beings (generic "whosoever" and named sin categories) — Rev 20:15; 21:8

Only for group 1 (supernatural entities) is the torment formula ("tormented day and night for ever and ever") applied, and only at Rev 20:10. Groups 2 and 3 receive the "cast in" language and "second death" identification but NOT the torment formula.

### TORMENTS (of the wicked)

**Nave's entry:**
> "Of the wicked — LUK 16:23-28; REV 14:10, 11
> See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF"

**Analysis of the two listed passages:**

**Luke 16:23-28 (Rich Man and Lazarus):**
- G931 (basanos) = torment noun — "being in torments" (v.23); "this place of torment" (v.28)
- Pre-resurrection, intermediate state (hades), not the final state
- Already resolved as IB006 (Moderate toward parabolic reading) — DO NOT re-open

**Rev 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers):**
- G928 (basanizō) = "shall be tormented" (v.10); G929 (basanismos) in implied context of v.11's "smoke of their torment"
- "The smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" — IB009 STRONG toward literary-formula/desolation reading (established etc5-11)
- "No rest day nor night" — IB014 Moderate toward judgment-process reading (established etc5-11)

### SECOND DEATH

**Nave's entry:**
> "General scriptures concerning — REV 20:14
> See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF"

**The second death in Revelation:**
- **Rev 2:11** — "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death" (first occurrence; mentioned as a threat without full definition)
- **Rev 20:6** — "on such the second death hath no power" (for first-resurrection saints)
- **Rev 20:14** — "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. **This is the second death.**" (explicit identity statement: lake of fire = second death)
- **Rev 21:8** — "the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: **which is the second death**" (same identity; list of human sin-categories)

**Greek analysis (from parsing):**
- ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος (ho thanatos ho deuteros) = "the second death"
- G2288 (thanatos) + G1208 (deuteros)
- The equative sentence in Rev 20:14: "οὗτος ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός ἐστιν, ἡ λίμνη τοῦ πυρός" = "this death, the second, is [= equates to] the lake of fire"
- Established as N021 (Conditionalist) — the second death IS the lake of fire

**Key theological point:** The lake of fire is described as "the second death" for human beings (Rev 20:14, 15; 21:8). Death language (not torment language) is the primary descriptor for the human wicked's final state.

### PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL (from PUNISHMENT entry)

**Nave's PUNISHMENT entry — ETERNAL subdivision:**
> "ISA 34:8-10; DAN 12:2; MAT 3:12; 10:28; 18:8; 25:41, 46; MRK 3:29; LUK 3:17; JHN 5:29; HEB 6:2; 10:28-31; REV 14:10, 11; 19:3; 20:10"

**Verse survey of the ETERNAL subdivision:**
- **Isa 34:8-10** — Edom's streams turned to pitch, burning night and day, smoke going up for ever — IB009's OT source, literary-formula/desolation reading
- **Dan 12:2** — "some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" — nearest OT parallel to Mat 25:46's double outcome
- **Mat 3:12** — "burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire" — G762 (asbestos) fire; fire is unquenchable (cannot be put out), not necessarily eternal process
- **Mat 10:28** — "destroy [apollumi] both soul and body in hell" — conditionalist vocabulary
- **Mat 18:8** — "cast into everlasting [aiōnion] fire" — fire is everlasting/eternal
- **Mat 25:41** — "everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels"
- **Mat 25:46** — "everlasting punishment [aionion kolasin]... life eternal [zōēn aionion]"
- **Mrk 3:29** — "in danger of eternal [aioniou] damnation/judgment [kriseōs]"
- **Luk 3:17** — "unquenchable fire"
- **Jhn 5:29** — "resurrection of damnation" (krisis)
- **Heb 6:2** — "eternal judgment" (krima aiōniou)
- **Heb 10:28-31** — "fearful expectation of judgment and fiery indignation"
- **Rev 14:10-11** — beast-worshippers tormented; smoke for ever (IB009)
- **Rev 19:3** — Babylon's smoke for ever (E250, same formula as completed destruction)
- **Rev 20:10** — devil/beast/false prophet tormented for ever (the primary text of this study)

**Key observation:** The entire Nave's PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL list does not contain a single passage that EXPLICITLY uses torment vocabulary (G928/G929) for HUMAN BEINGS in their final state while clearly excluding the possibility of a conditionalist reading. The closest is Rev 14:10-11 (IB009, resolved Strong toward literary-formula) and Rev 20:10 (the primary text, for named supernatural entities).

### WICKED (PEOPLE), PUNISHMENT OF

**Nave's entry (WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF subdivision):**
This is the most extensive topical entry in Nave's for judgment. Key references include (selected relevant NT passages):

> MAT 3:7,10,12; 5:19-30; 7:13,19,23,26,27; **8:12**; 10:28,33; 11:23; 12:34; **13:12-15,30,38-42,49,50**; 15:13; 16:26; **18:7-9,34,35**; 21:19,41,44; **22:13**; 23:14,33; 24:50,51; **25:30,32,33,41,46**; 26:24; MRK 4:12,25; 8:36,38; 9:43; 11:26; 12:1-9,40; 14:21; 16:16; LUK 3:7,17; 6:49; 8:18; 9:24-26; **12:4,5,46,47**; 13:3,5-7,9,**24,27,28**; 16:22-28; 17:1,2; 19:26,27; 20:18; 22:22; 23:30,31; JHN 3:15,16,18,36; 5:14,29; 7:34; 8:21; 12:40; 15:2; 17:12; ACT 1:18,25; 3:23; ROM 1:18; 2:5,8; 5:12,21; 6:16,21; 8:2,6,7,13; 9:22; 11:22; 14:23; 1CO 3:17; 5:5,13; 6:9,10; 9:27; 10:5-11; 15:21,22; 2CO 7:10; GAL 3:10; 5:19,20; 6:8; EPH 5:5,6; PHP 3:18,19; COL 3:25; **1TH 1:10; 5:3**; **2TH 1:5-9**; 2:8-10; 1TI 1:20; 5:24; 2TI 2:12,13; HEB 2:2,3; 6:8; 10:27-31; JAS 1:14,15; 5:1-3,20; 1PE 3:12; 4:17,18; 2PE 2:3-9,12-17; 1JN 3:14,15; Jude 1:5-7,11-15; **REV 2:22,23; 3:3; 6:15-17; 9:4-6,15,18; 11:18; 14:9-11; 16:2-21; 18:5; 19:15,17-21; 20:10,15; 21:8,27; 22:19**

**Vocabulary audit of human wicked passages:**
The Nave's WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF list extensively cites passages describing the final fate of human sinners. When examined for vocabulary:
- Destruction vocabulary (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora) dominates the epistolary literature
- Fire/burning imagery dominates the gospel/prophetic literature
- Torment vocabulary (basanizō/basanismos) appears explicitly in the list only at Rev 14:9-11 (beast-worshippers) and Rev 20:10 (devil/beast/false prophet)
- 2 Thess 1:9 ("everlasting destruction, olethron aionion") uses DESTRUCTION vocabulary for human wicked

### SATAN

**Nave's entry (selected judgment-relevant portions):**

*Names and titles of Satan:*
> Abaddon (Hebrew: Destroyer), REV 9:11; Apollyon (Greek: Destroyer), REV 9:11; The Devil, MAT 4:1; LUK 4:2,6; REV 20:2; "That old serpent," REV 12:9; 20:2; "The god of this world," 2CO 4:4; "Prince of the power of the air," EPH 2:2

*Kingdom to be destroyed:*
> 2SA 23:6,7 [wicked like thorns burned]; MAT 12:29; 13:30; LUK 11:21,22; 1JN 3:8

*Unclassified scriptures (judgment-relevant):*
> GEN 3:14,15 (enmity between seed); MAT 25:41 (everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels); 2PE 2:4 (angels cast to tartaroo); Jude 1:6-9 (angels in everlasting chains); HEB 2:14 (Christ destroys him who had power of death); REV 20:1-3,7,8,10 (Satan bound, released, cast into lake)

**Key observation from Satan entry:** The SATAN topic in Nave's cross-references Mat 25:41 (everlasting fire PREPARED FOR the devil and his angels) and Rev 20:1-3, 7-8, 10 (the binding/release/final judgment of Satan). The entry thus links the Matthew 25 fire passage directly to the Satan narrative, supporting the reading that the fire's primary intended recipients are supernatural.

### HELL (Future Home of the Wicked)

**Nave's entry:**
> "THE FUTURE HOME OF THE WICKED: PSA 9:17; PRO 5:5; 9:13,15-18; 15:24; 23:13,14; ISA 30:33; 33:14; MAT 3:12; 5:29,30; 7:13,14; 8:11,12; 10:28; 13:30,38-42,49,50; 16:18; 18:8,9,34,35; 22:13; 25:28-30,41,46; MRK 9:43-48; LUK 3:17; 16:23-26,28; ACT 1:25; 2TH 1:9; 2PE 2:4; Jude 1:6-23; REV 2:11; 9:1,2; 11:7; 14:10,11; 19:20; 20:10,15; 21:8"

**Observations from the HELL entry:**
- The entry includes both explicit torment passages (Rev 14:10-11; 20:10) AND explicit destruction/conditionalist passages (Mat 10:28 apollumi; 2 Thess 1:9 olethros aionion; Mat 7:13-14 apoleia)
- The entry does NOT differentiate between torment language and destruction language — it treats both as describing the same final destination
- This shows Nave's itself holds both vocabulary sets under one heading without resolving the mechanism question
- Key passages for this study: Rev 14:10,11; 19:20; 20:10,15; 21:8

### PUNISHMENT (General) — Key Subdivision

From the PUNISHMENT entry, the ETERNAL subdivision lists: ISA 34:8-10; DAN 12:2; MAT 3:12; 10:28; 18:8; 25:41,46; MRK 3:29; LUK 3:17; JHN 5:29; HEB 6:2; 10:28-31; REV 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10.

Notable: Rev 19:3 (Babylon's smoke for ever) is included in the PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL list — this is the IB009 evidence that the "for ever and ever" formula in same-book context (Revelation) describes completed destruction.

### HADES

From Nave's semantic search: MAT 10:28; 11:23; 16:18; LUK 10:15; 16:23; ACT 2:27,31; REV 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14

Key for this study: Rev 20:13-14 — hades delivers up the dead; hades is cast into the lake (= second death). Hades ENDS when cast into the lake, suggesting the intermediate state is terminated by the final judgment, not extended as ongoing torment.

### ETERNITY

From Nave's: PSA 30:12; MAT 6:13; 18:8; 2CO 9:9; **JUDE 1:6**

Jude 1:6 appears in Nave's ETERNITY entry — the "everlasting [aidios] chains" for rebellious angels is treated as a reference to eternity. Note: G126 (aidios) appears in Jude 1:6 and Romans 1:20 only; it is DIFFERENT from G166 (aionios) used in Mat 25:41,46 and Rev 14:11.
