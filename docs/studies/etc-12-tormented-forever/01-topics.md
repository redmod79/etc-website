## Question
What does Revelation 20:10 mean by "tormented day and night for ever and ever"? Who are the three named subjects? Is the "tormented for ever and ever" formula applied to human beings anywhere in Scripture, or only to the devil, beast, and false prophet? What does basanizo (G928) mean across its full NT usage? When humans enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8), what term does the text use? How does the text distinguish between the fate of the three named entities (Rev 20:10) and the fate of human beings (Rev 20:9, 14-15; 21:8)?

**Key observation:** Satan is consistently identified as a non-human supernatural entity throughout Scripture. Nave's lists him under multiple symbolic/spiritual designations (dragon, serpent, adversary, prince of darkness). He is NOT a human being.

### DEMONS
- Worship of: LEV 17:7; DEU 32:17; 2CH 11:15; PSA 106:37; MAT 4:9; LUK 4:7; 1CO 10:20,21; 1TI 4:1; REV 13:4
- Possession by: multiple instances
- Testify to the divinity of Jesus: MAT 8:29; MRK 1:23,24; 3:11; 5:7; LUK 8:28; ACT 19:15
- Believe and tremble: JAS 2:19
- To be judged at the general judgment: MAT 8:29; with 2PE 2:4; Jude 1:6
- **Punishment of:** MAT 8:29; 25:41; LUK 8:28; 2PE 2:4; Jude 1:6; REV 12:7-9

**Key observation:** Nave's lists Matt 25:41 ("everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels") under DEMONS - Punishment of. The everlasting fire was "prepared for" these supernatural entities.

### TORMENTS
- Of the wicked: LUK 16:23-28; REV 14:10,11
- See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Key observation:** Nave's TORMENTS entry is very brief, citing only Luke 16 (parabolic) and Rev 14:10-11 (apocalyptic). No didactic passage is cited. The entry redirects to WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF.

### PUNISHMENT (full entry)
- Death Penalty: Various modes and offenses
- Minor Offenses: Scourging, imprisonment
- Entailed upon children: EXO 34:7; JER 31:29; LAM 5:7; EZK 18:2,3
- According to Deeds: JOB 34:11; PSA 62:12; PRO 12:14; etc.
- Delayed: PSA 50:21; 55:19; PRO 1:24-30; ECC 8:11-13
- Design of: To secure obedience
- Divine: No escape from
- **ETERNAL:** ISA 34:8-10; DAN 12:2; MAT 3:12; 10:28; 18:8; 25:41,46; MRK 3:29; LUK 3:17; JHN 5:29; HEB 6:2; 10:28-31; REV 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10

**Key observation:** Nave's PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL lists Matt 10:28 ("destroy both soul and body in hell") alongside Rev 20:10 in the same category. It also includes "everlasting fire" (Matt 18:8; 25:41) and destruction passages (Matt 3:12; Luke 3:17). Nave's does not distinguish between "torment" and "destruction" passages within the ETERNAL subdivision -- both are included.

### FIRE
- Figurative: Of the destruction of the wicked: MAT 13:42,50; 25:41; MRK 9:44; REV 9:2; 21:8
- Everlasting fire: ISA 33:14; MAT 18:8; 25:41; MRK 9:44

**Key observation:** Nave's classifies fire in the judgment context under "the destruction of the wicked" -- destruction vocabulary, not torment vocabulary. Even the "everlasting fire" passages are filed under FIGURATIVE.

### WICKED (PEOPLE), PUNISHMENT OF
This is the largest topical entry, containing extensive verse lists spanning both testaments. Key sections:
- Punishment spans: GEN 2:17 through REV 22:19
- References JUDGMENTS, HELL, PUNISHMENT
- Includes both destruction vocabulary passages (Matt 10:28; 2 Thess 1:5-9; Phil 3:18,19) and torment vocabulary passages (Rev 14:9-11; 20:10)
- Also includes "second death" passages (Rev 20:15; 21:8)
