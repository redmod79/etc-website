## 1. Rev 19:17-21 — Beast and False Prophet Cast Alive into the Lake

**Context:** The Rider on the White Horse (Christ) defeats the beast and his armies. The battle outcome differentiates between the beast/false prophet (cast alive into lake) and the human armies (slain with sword).

> **Rev 19:17** And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
>
> **Rev 19:18** That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all [men, both] free and bond, both small and great.
>
> **Rev 19:19** And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
>
> **Rev 19:20** And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. **These both were cast alive [ζῶντες, G2198, Pres Act Ptcp] into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.**
>
> **Rev 19:21** And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which [sword] proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.

**Exegetical observations:**
- ζῶντες (zōntes) = Present Active Participle of G2198 (zaō) = "being alive / while living" — the beast and false prophet are cast into the lake of fire in a living, conscious state.
- The human remnant (v.21) are "slain with the sword" — they die in the conventional sense before any lake-of-fire fate.
- This is the FIRST appearance of the lake of fire with named subjects. The torment formula does not appear here; it is added in Rev 20:10 when the devil is also cast in.
- The parallel with Rev 20:10 (confirmed by cross-testament analysis, score 0.641) establishes that the "where the beast and the false prophet are" of Rev 20:10 refers back to this event in Rev 19:20.

**Also note: Rev 19:3 (immediately preceding context):**
> **Rev 19:3** And again they said, Alleluia. And **her smoke rose up for ever and ever.**

This is the smoke-for-ever formula (εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων) applied to Babylon's completed destruction — the identical formula to Rev 20:10's torment description. Established as E250/IB009 Strong toward literary-formula/desolation in etc5-11.

## 2. Rev 20:1-15 — Full Chapter (Judgment Sequence)

**Context:** The entire eschatological sequence: Satan's binding → millennium → release → final battle → lake of fire → great white throne → resurrection and judgment → lake of fire for human wicked.

> **Rev 20:1** And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
>
> **Rev 20:2** And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and **bound him a thousand years**,
>
> **Rev 20:3** And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
>
> **Rev 20:4** And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and [I saw] the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
>
> **Rev 20:5** But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This [is] the first resurrection.
>
> **Rev 20:6** Blessed and holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such **the second death hath no power**, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
>
> **Rev 20:7** And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
>
> **Rev 20:8** And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea.
>
> **Rev 20:9** And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and **fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured [κατέφαγεν, kataphagō = ate up/consumed] them**.
>
> **Rev 20:10** And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and **shall be tormented [βασανισθήσονται, G928, Fut Pass Ind 3P] day and night for ever and ever [εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων]**.
>
> **Rev 20:11** And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
>
> **Rev 20:12** And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
>
> **Rev 20:13** And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
>
> **Rev 20:14** And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. **This is the second death** [οὗτος ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός ἐστιν, ἡ λίμνη τοῦ πυρός].
>
> **Rev 20:15** And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

**Structural analysis of Rev 20 outcomes:**

| Verse | Subject | Verb | Additional Language |
|-------|---------|------|---------------------|
| v.9 | Nations (human) surrounding camp | devoured (kataphagō) | Consumption language — E180 |
| v.10 | Devil, beast, false prophet (supernatural) | cast in + tormented day and night for ever and ever | βασανισθήσονται G928 FPI3P |
| v.14 | Death and hades (conceptual) | cast in | "This is the second death" — identity statement |
| v.15 | Whosoever not in book of life (human wicked) | cast in | No torment formula added |

**Critical observation:** The torment formula ("tormented day and night for ever and ever") appears ONCE in Rev 20, at v.10, with the three named supernatural subjects as its grammatical referent. The human wicked (v.15) are "cast in" but receive no torment formula. The subject of βασανισθήσονται (Fut Pass Ind 3rd Plural) is the three nominative-case entities of v.10: ὁ διάβολος (devil), τὸ θηρίον (beast), ὁ ψευδοπροφήτης (false prophet).

## 3. Rev 21:1-8 — New Creation; Second Death for Human Wicked

> **Rev 21:1** And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
>
> **Rev 21:2** And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
>
> **Rev 21:3** And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, [and be] their God.
>
> **Rev 21:4** And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be **no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain**: for the former things are passed away.
>
> **Rev 21:5** And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
>
> **Rev 21:6** And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
>
> **Rev 21:7** He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
>
> **Rev 21:8** But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: **which is the second death** [ὅ ἐστιν ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος].

**Exegetical observations:**
- Rev 21:4 — the new creation has "no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither... any more pain." If the wicked were simultaneously experiencing eternal conscious torment in the lake of fire, this would need qualification. The verse apparently describes the new creation from the redeemed's perspective.
- Rev 21:8 — eight categories of human sinners; their outcome is ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος ("the second death") — DEATH language, not torment language.
- The Greek: ὅ ἐστιν (G3739 + G1510) = "which is" — an equative relative clause identifying the lake as "the second death."
- No G928/G929 in Rev 21:8. The human wicked's fate is described as death (thanatos), not torment (basanismos).

## 4. Mat 25:31-46 — Judgment of Nations (Full Passage)

> **25:31** When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
>
> **25:32** And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep from the goats:
>
> **25:33** And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
>
> **25:34** Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
>
> **25:35-39** [Righteousness toward "the least of these" — feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned]
>
> **25:40** And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done [it] unto me.
>
> **25:41** Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, **Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire [τὸ πῦρ τὸ αἰώνιον], prepared for the devil [τῷ διαβόλῳ, dative] and his angels [τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ, dative]:**
>
> **25:42-44** [Failure to serve "the least of these"]
>
> **25:45** Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it] not to me.
>
> **25:46** And **these shall go away into everlasting punishment [κόλασιν αἰώνιον, G2851 + G166]: but the righteous into life eternal [ζωὴν αἰώνιον, G2222 + G166]**.

**Exegetical observations:**

**Mat 25:41:**
- "Everlasting fire" (πῦρ τὸ αἰώνιον) — the FIRE is characterized as everlasting/eternal (G166).
- "Prepared [ἡτοιμασμένον, Perfect Passive Participle] for the devil and his angels" — dative of purpose; the fire was prepared FOR (intended for) the devil (G1228, diabolos) and his angels (G32, angeloi).
- The human condemned are sent INTO the fire already prepared for supernatural beings. The fire's PRIMARY intended recipients are named as supernatural.
- No torment vocabulary (G928/G929) in v.41.

**Mat 25:46:**
- "Everlasting punishment" — κόλασιν αἰώνιον: G2851 (kolasis = penal infliction, from kolazō = to prune/curtail/punish) + G166 (aionios = everlasting). The noun kolasis designates the punitive category, not the mechanism.
- "Life eternal" — ζωὴν αἰώνιον: G2222 (zōē) + G166 (aionios). The grammatical symmetry: both outcomes use identical G166 in identical case (A-ASF Accusative Singular Feminine).
- "These shall go away [ἀπελεύσονται, Future Middle 3P]" — movement to a destination; not explicit ongoing-torment description.
- The noun choice (kolasis vs. basanismos) is significant: if "everlasting torment" were intended, basanismos (G929) was available and used elsewhere in Revelation. Kolasis was chosen, which designates punishment generically.

## 5. Mat 13:36-43, 47-50 — Tares and Dragnet Parables

> **13:36** Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
>
> **13:37** He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
>
> **13:38** The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];
>
> **13:39** The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
>
> **13:40** As therefore the tares are gathered and **burned [katakaiō, G2618 = burn down/consume]** in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
>
> **13:41** The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
>
> **13:42** And shall **cast them into a furnace of fire [κλίβανον τοῦ πυρός]: there shall be wailing [κλαυθμός, G2805] and gnashing [βρυγμός, G1030] of teeth**.
>
> **13:43** Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

> **13:47** Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
>
> **13:48** Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
>
> **13:49** So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
>
> **13:50** And shall **cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth**.

**Exegetical observations:**
- Tares parable: The comparison is tares "burned" in fire (v.40, katakaiō = burn down/consume) — imagery of being consumed.
- The "furnace of fire" (κλίβανον τοῦ πυρός) is a cooking/smelting metaphor; in ancient usage, a furnace is associated with consumption of what is placed within it.
- Wailing and gnashing of teeth — emotional responses; described at the moment of casting/judgment. The text does not specify a duration of this response.
- Both parables use the same wailing/gnashing formula — the repetition suggests a fixed expression for the moment of condemnation, not necessarily a description of an ongoing eternal state.

## 6. All "Wailing and Gnashing" Passages

**Matthew 8:11-12:**
> **8:11** And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
>
> **8:12** But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into **outer darkness: there shall be weeping [κλαυθμός] and gnashing [βρυγμός] of teeth**.

**Matthew 22:11-14:**
> **22:12** And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
>
> **22:13** Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast [him] into **outer darkness; there shall be weeping [κλαυθμός] and gnashing [βρυγμός] of teeth**.
>
> **22:14** For many are called, but few [are] chosen.

**Matthew 24:45-51:**
> **24:51** And shall cut him asunder, and appoint [him] his portion with the hypocrites: **there shall be weeping [κλαυθμός] and gnashing [βρυγμός] of teeth**.

**Matthew 25:14-30:**
> **25:30** And cast ye the unprofitable servant into **outer darkness: there shall be weeping [κλαυθμός] and gnashing [βρυγμός] of teeth**.

**Luke 13:24-30:**
> **13:28** There shall be **weeping [κλαυθμός] and gnashing [βρυγμός] of teeth**, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you [yourselves] thrust out.

**Full occurrence summary:**

| Passage | Context | Setting |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Mat 8:12 | Centurion's faith; children of kingdom cast out | outer darkness |
| Mat 13:42 | Tares parable | furnace of fire |
| Mat 13:50 | Dragnet parable | furnace of fire |
| Mat 22:13 | Wedding garment | outer darkness |
| Mat 24:51 | Evil servant cut asunder | with the hypocrites |
| Mat 25:30 | Unprofitable servant | outer darkness |
| Luk 13:28 | Narrow gate; shut door; thrust out | excluded from kingdom |

**Pattern analysis:**
- 3 passages: "outer darkness" (Mat 8:12; 22:13; 25:30) — exclusion from the light/kingdom
- 2 passages: "furnace of fire" (Mat 13:42, 50) — burning/consuming imagery
- 1 passage: "with the hypocrites" (Mat 24:51) — punishment in company of the unfaithful
- 1 passage: "thrust out" from the kingdom (Luk 13:28) — exclusion language
- "Outer darkness" and "furnace of fire" describe different settings — they appear not to be simultaneous descriptions of the same ongoing state
- The weeping/gnashing describes an emotional RESPONSE at the moment of judgment/exclusion — grammatically linked to the moment of casting out/being thrust out, not necessarily an endless ongoing state
- No Greek tense implies "eternally ongoing" for the weeping/gnashing — the verbs of casting are aorist (completed action); the weeping/gnashing is present in the sense of expected response, not explicitly future continuous

## 7. Supernatural Being Judgment Passages

### Jude 1:6 — Angels in Everlasting Chains

> **Jude 1:6** And **the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved [τετήρηκεν, Perfect Active Indicative] in everlasting [ἀϊδίοις, G126, aidios] chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day**.

**Greek notes:**
- G126 (aidios) = "everlasting/eternal" — a different word from G166 (aionios). Used only here and Romans 1:20 in NT.
- τετήρηκεν (tetrēken) = Perfect Active Indicative — "has reserved and continues to hold" — ongoing confinement to a future moment.
- εἰς κρίσιν μεγάλης ἡμέρας = "unto the judgment of the great day" — the confinement is TEMPORARY, pending final judgment. The chains are the pre-judgment holding state.
- Contrast: In Rev 20:10, the torment formula follows the FINAL casting, not a holding state. The angels of Jude 1:6 are still awaiting judgment; the devil/beast/false prophet of Rev 20:10 are post-judgment.

### 2 Peter 2:4 — Tartaroo (Tartarus)

> **2 Pet 2:4** For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but **cast [them] down to hell [ταρταρώσας, tartaroō, G5020, hapax legomenon], and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment**;

**Greek notes:**
- G5020 (tartaroō) = unique Greek verb; to cast down to Tartarus (from Tartaros = the abyss below Hades in Greek cosmology); only NT occurrence.
- Same pattern as Jude 1:6: angels reserved UNTO judgment (εἰς κρίσιν), not yet judged.
- 2 Pet 2:5-6 continues the argument: God spared not the old world (flood) nor Sodom/Gomorrha (ashes). The Sodom-as-ashes parallel (v.6) is the IB009-resolved (formerly N029, reclassified N→I-B) conditionalist evidence.

### Matthew 25:41 — Everlasting Fire Prepared for Devil and Angels

> **Mat 25:41** Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, **Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels**:

*(Full text and Greek notes in Section 4 above.)*

The fire was prepared FOR (dative: τῷ διαβόλῳ, τοῖς ἀγγέλοις) the devil and his angels. Human sinners are also sent into it, but its primary named intended recipients are supernatural beings.

### 1 Corinthians 6:3 — We Shall Judge Angels

> **1 Cor 6:3** Know ye not that **we shall judge angels [ἀγγέλους κρινοῦμεν]**? how much more things that pertain to this life?

**Note:** This passage establishes that angels face judgment — consistent with the Jude 1:6 / 2 Pet 2:4 pattern of angelic beings reserved "unto judgment." The saints will participate in that judgment. The nature of the judgment (its outcome, mechanism) is not specified here.

### Hebrews 2:14 — Christ Destroys the Devil

> **Heb 2:14** Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that **through death he might destroy [καταργήσῃ, G2673, Aor Act Subj] him that had the power of death, that is, the devil** [τὸν διάβολον];

**Greek notes:**
- G2673 (katargeō) = to render inoperative, abolish, bring to nothing, put an end to. NOT the same as G622 (apollumi = destroy fully/perish). The Aorist Subjunctive in purpose clause (ἵνα καταργήσῃ) = "in order that he might render inoperative/destroy."
- The goal: destroying him who HAD (εἴχοντα, Past participle — had, at the time of incarnation) the power (κράτος) of death.
- The devil's power over death is what is being destroyed/rendered inoperative. Whether this means ultimate annihilation of the devil's existence or rendering his power null is a question the verb form leaves open.

---

## 8. Conditionalist Contrast Passages

### John 3:14-16 — Perish (apollumi) vs. Eternal Life

> **John 3:15** That whosoever believeth in him should not **perish [ἀπόληται, G622, Aor Mid Subj]**, but have eternal life.
>
> **John 3:16** For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not **perish [ἀπόληται, G622, Aor Mid Subj]**, but have everlasting life.

**Note:** G622 (apollumi) = to destroy fully/perish. The antithesis in the verse is not "torment vs. comfort" but "perish vs. have life." The conditionalist reading is that "perish" (apollumi) describes the fate of the unbeliever — destruction/cessation, contrasted with the positive possession of eternal life.

### Matthew 10:28 — Destroy Body and Soul in Gehenna

> **Mat 10:28** And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which **is able to destroy [ἀπολέσαι, G622, Aor Act Inf] both soul and body in hell [γεέννῃ, gehenna]**.

**Note:** The word is G622 (apollumi) = destroy, not G928 (basanizō) = torment. Both soul AND body are destroyed — this is a statement about the totality of destruction in gehenna, consistent with conditionalism. ECT reading typically argues that "destroy" here means "ruin/bring to misery," but the lexical force of apollumi is "destroy fully/perish."

### 2 Thessalonians 1:5-9 — Everlasting Destruction

> **2 Thess 1:7** And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
>
> **2 Thess 1:8** In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
>
> **2 Thess 1:9** Who shall be punished with **everlasting destruction [ὄλεθρον αἰώνιον, G3639 + G166] from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power**;

**Note:** G3639 (olethros) = ruin/destruction/ruin. G166 (aionios) = everlasting. "Everlasting destruction" — the same adjective (aionios) that modifies "fire" in Mat 25:41 and "punishment" in Mat 25:46 here modifies "destruction." The punishment of the human wicked is described as DESTRUCTION (olethros), not torment (basanismos). "From the presence of the Lord" — banishment/separation language.

### Philippians 3:17-19 — End is Destruction (Apoleia)

> **Phil 3:18-19** (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:
>
> Whose **end [τέλος] is destruction [ἀπώλεια, G684]**, whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

**Note:** G684 (apoleia) = ruin/loss/perdition/destruction. The TELOS (end, goal, outcome) of enemies of the cross is described as apoleia — the same destruction-vocabulary word used in Mat 7:13 ("broad way to destruction").

### Matthew 7:13-14 — Wide Road to Destruction

> **Mat 7:13** Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide [is] the gate, and broad [is] the way, that leadeth to **destruction [ἀπώλειαν, G684]**, and many there be which go in thereat:
>
> **Mat 7:14** Because strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth unto **life**, and few there be that find it.

**Note:** The antithesis is destruction (apoleia) vs. life (zōē) — the same life/death binary as John 3:16 (perish vs. live). Not torment vs. comfort. The road leads to apoleia (ruin/destruction), not to basanismos (torment).

## Additional Context Passages

### Rev 14:9-11 — Beast-Worshippers (for comparison)

> **Rev 14:9** And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
>
> **Rev 14:10** The same shall **drink of the wine of the wrath of God**... and he shall be **tormented [βασανισθήσεται, G928, Fut Pass Ind 3S] with fire and brimstone** in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
>
> **Rev 14:11** And **the smoke of their torment [βασανισμοῦ, G929] ascendeth up for ever and ever**: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

**Context for this study:** Rev 14:10-11 uses BOTH G928 (verb, v.10) and G929 (noun, v.11) for a defined group: beast-worshippers. IB009 resolved STRONG toward literary-formula/desolation reading in etc5-11 on the basis of the Isa 34:10 OT source and Rev 19:3's use of the same formula for Babylon's completed destruction. IB014 resolved Moderate toward judgment-process reading for "no rest day nor night" (Rev 4:8 parallel).

This passage is the only NT text using G928/G929 for a specific HUMAN group in an eschatological judgment context (as opposed to the supernatural trio of Rev 20:10). Its resolution in prior studies (IB009 Strong, IB014 Moderate) governs its use here.

### Rev 20:9 — Nations Devoured (E180)

> **Rev 20:9** And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and **fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured [κατέφαγεν, G2719, kataphagō = ate up/consumed] them**.

**Note:** The nations who surround the camp in the final battle are DEVOURED (kataphagō = ate up/consumed). This is the conditionalist language — consumption/destruction. The IMMEDIATELY following verse (v.10) uses torment language for the devil. The adjacent contrast between v.9 (nations devoured) and v.10 (devil/beast/false prophet tormented) is the E180 evidence.
