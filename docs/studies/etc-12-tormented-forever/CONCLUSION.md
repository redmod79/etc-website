## Question

What does Revelation 20:10 mean by "tormented day and night for ever and ever"? Who are the specific named subjects? Is the explicit "tormented for ever and ever" formula applied to human beings or to supernatural entities (the devil, beast, false prophet)? Do other passages in Scripture describe ongoing conscious torment as the final state of human beings? How does the vocabulary of torment (basanizō/basanismos) relate to the vocabulary of destruction (apollumi/apoleia/olethros) when applied to the wicked?

---

## Summary Answer

The "tormented day and night for ever and ever" formula in Rev 20:10 is grammatically applied to exactly three named entities — the devil, the beast, and the false prophet — all identified as supernatural or apocalyptic entities in Revelation's own narrative. The adjacent verse (Rev 20:15) casts generic human wicked into the same lake of fire without repeating the torment formula; instead, the lake is called "the second death" (Rev 20:14; 21:8) when human beings are in view. The torment vocabulary (G928 basanizō, G929 basanismos) in NT eschatological contexts is confined to Revelation and always applied to specific defined entities, never to the general mass of the human wicked in Paul's epistles or the gospels, where destruction vocabulary (apollumi, apoleia, olethros) dominates. The for-ever-and-ever formula modifies an active torment verb at Rev 20:10 (not merely a smoke noun as at Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3), creating a distinction from the IB009-governed smoke passages; however, IB009's demonstration that the identical formula can describe completed/permanent judgment (Rev 19:3 for Babylon) prevents reading the formula as necessarily implying ongoing conscious perpetual experience even in Rev 20:10's direct-verb application. The new IB015 addresses this distinction.

## Key Verses

**Revelation 20:10** (Primary text)
"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented [βασανισθήσονται — G928, Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural] day and night for ever and ever [εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων]."

**Revelation 20:15** (Adjacent, same passage, different vocabulary for human wicked)
"And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."

**Revelation 19:20** (First lake-of-fire occurrence; introduces the beast and false prophet)
"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet... These both were cast alive [ζῶντες — G2198, Present Active Participle] into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."

**Revelation 20:14** (Second death = lake of fire; identity statement for human judgment)
"And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."

**Revelation 21:8** (Second death for eight named human categories)
"...shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."

**Matthew 25:46** (Everlasting punishment for human wicked)
"And these shall go away into everlasting punishment [κόλασιν αἰώνιον — G2851 + G166]: but the righteous into life eternal."

## Analysis

### I. Subject Differentiation in Revelation 20:7-15

Rev 20:7-15 is a single narrative unit containing four distinct outcomes for four distinct groups, each with its own vocabulary:

| Verse | Subject | Language | Vocabulary Type |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| v.9 | Nations (human armies) | "devoured [katephagen]" | Consumption/destruction |
| v.10 | Devil, beast, false prophet | "tormented day and night for ever and ever" | Torment formula |
| v.14 | Death and hades | "cast in" + "this IS the second death" | Death identity |
| v.15 | Human wicked ("whosoever not found written") | "was cast into the lake of fire" | Cast-in only; no torment language |

The torment formula of v.10 is applied exclusively to the named supernatural entities. The human wicked of v.15, cast into the same lake in the immediately following verse, receive no torment language appended to their casting. This vocabulary differentiation within a single author, a single chapter, and adjacent verses is an observable textual pattern (E212, established etc5-08; updated to include etc5-12).

### II. Rev 19:20 — Beast and False Prophet Cast "Alive"

The first occurrence of the lake of fire in Revelation casts the beast and false prophet in "while living" (ζῶντες — Present Active Participle of G2198 zaō, "to live"). The same verse's human remnant is "slain with the sword" (killed) — they die first, by a different means, in the same narrative unit.

The beast and false prophet's being cast in alive bypasses the death-resurrection-judgment sequence that applies to mortal humans (Rev 20:12-15). They are present in the lake a thousand years before the general human judgment of Rev 20:15. The torment formula in Rev 20:10 is retroactively applied to cover all three supernatural entities together, including the two who had been in the lake since Rev 19:20 (E259, new this study).

### III. The Torment Formula at Rev 20:10 — New IB015

The for-ever-and-ever formula (εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων) has been established at three Revelation judgment sites:
- **Rev 14:11:** "smoke of their torment [basanismou] ascendeth up for ever and ever" — formula modifies smoke-ascending (noun construction)
- **Rev 19:3:** "smoke [kapnos] of her [Babylon's] ascendeth up for ever and ever" — formula modifies smoke-ascending for a city described as "found no more at all" (IB009 STRONG demonstration)
- **Rev 20:10:** "shall be tormented [basanisthesontai] day and night for ever and ever" — formula directly modifies the active torment verb

IB009 (STRONG, established etc5-11) established that the formula can describe a permanent, completed judgment — Babylon is "found no more at all" yet its smoke ascends for ever. The question at Rev 20:10 is whether the formula applied directly to the torment verb (rather than to ascending smoke) carries different evidential force.

**Arguments that the direct-verb application strengthens the ECT reading:** The subjects of basanisthesontai are three named entities, not a smoke noun. The for-ever formula directly modifies their active torment state, not a visible residue of a completed event.

**Arguments that IB009's demonstration still applies:** The formula is identical in each use; the same author uses it for demonstrably completed destruction (Rev 19:3). The formula's distribution in Revelation — 11 applications to God, Christ, and the redeemed whose existence is inherently endless, 3 in judgment contexts including one for a destroyed city — demonstrates it is not an inherently eternal-conscious-experience indicator in all Revelation uses (E256). The subjects of Rev 20:10 (devil, beast, false prophet) are not human beings but supernatural/apocalyptic entities whose mode of existence is not assumed to be identical to mortal humans.

**SIS connections available:** Rev 19:3 (same author, same book, identical formula, demonstrably completed destruction) is a #4a SIS connection directly applicable. However, the structural difference — verb vs. smoke noun — introduces a formal distinction IB009 did not address.

**IB015 resolution (Moderate, New):** The for-ever-and-ever formula applied to the active torment verb at Rev 20:10 for three named supernatural entities does not collapse into IB009's resolved Strong position, because the grammatical application differs. However, IB009's within-book demonstration (Rev 19:3) prevents reading the formula as unambiguously asserting ongoing conscious perpetual experience even here, since the formula can describe permanent, irrevocable judgment outcomes. The weight is Moderate: toward "permanent/irrevocable judgment of specific supernatural entities" rather than "necessary ongoing conscious perpetual torment" — but less strongly resolved than IB009's smoke-formula cases, because the verb application is a more direct statement and does not have a same-category within-book counter-demonstration. Classification: Neutral.

### IV. Human Wicked — Death Language, Not Torment Language

For human beings, Revelation's primary descriptor of the lake of fire is "the second death" (thanatos deuteros), not "torment":

- Rev 20:14: "this IS the second death" (equative statement)
- Rev 20:15: human wicked cast in — no torment formula added
- Rev 21:8: eight categories of human sinners — "which IS the second death"

The word applied is G2288 (thanatos = death) — the same word used throughout the NT for biological death and the cessation of life. The name "second death" is the text's own designation for what the lake of fire means for human beings. N021 (established etc5-03) confirms: the second death IS the lake of fire, by explicit textual identification. The name chosen is death, not eternal torment.

Mat 25:46 uses kolasis (G2851, penal infliction from kolazo = to prune/curtail/punish) for the human wicked's outcome — NOT basanismos (G929 = torment) and NOT olethros (G3639 = destruction). Kolasis is a punitive-category word that specifies the character of the outcome (punitive/penal) without specifying the mechanism as either ongoing conscious suffering or destruction. It is genuinely neutral on the mechanism question (E209, updated to include etc5-12).

### V. Rev 14:9-11 — The Beast-Worshippers (IB008 Update)

This passage remains the NT text most directly cited for ongoing conscious torment of a human class. The subjects are a specifically defined tribulation-era group: "any man who worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark." The torment language (basanizō, basanismos) and the smoke-for-ever formula are applied to this group.

IB008 (Moderate AGAINST universal extension, established etc5-05) remains the standing assessment: the torment language applies to a specific defined group, not to all human wicked. IB009 (STRONG toward literary-formula/desolation for the smoke formula, established etc5-11) and IB014 (Moderate toward judgment-process for "no rest day nor night," established etc5-11) remain unchanged in resolution.

IB008 is updated with "etc5-12" in its "Also In" field. No change in resolution.

### VI. Vocabulary Differentiation — Torment vs. Destruction

The distributional pattern established across this series (N033, etc5-06) is confirmed and extended:

**Torment vocabulary (G928, G929) in eschatological Revelation contexts:**
- Rev 9:5 — five-month bounded torment (explicitly limited)
- Rev 14:10-11 — beast-worshippers (IB009 STRONG, IB014 Moderate)
- Rev 18:7,10,15 — Babylon (three uses; "in one hour" = completed judgment)
- Rev 20:10 — devil, beast, false prophet (three named supernatural entities)

**Destruction vocabulary for human wicked broadly:**
- Jhn 3:16 — apollumi (all who do not believe)
- Mat 10:28 — apollumi (soul and body in gehenna)
- Mat 7:13-14 — apoleia (broad road to destruction)
- Phil 3:19 — apoleia (enemies of the cross)
- 2 Th 1:9 — olethros aionion (everlasting destruction)
- 2 Pet 2:12 — apollumi (false teachers)

No NT passage applies G928 or G929 to the general mass of the human wicked outside Revelation. No Pauline epistle uses torment vocabulary for eschatological outcomes. No gospel passage applies torment vocabulary to the judgment of all sinners. The separation of vocabulary by subject type is a consistent, cross-author, cross-genre distributional fact.

### VII. Mat 25:41,46 — Supernatural Fire, Penal-Category Punishment

Mat 25:41 specifies that the everlasting fire was "prepared for [dative of purpose: τῷ διαβόλῳ] the devil and his angels" — the fire's named intended recipients are supernatural entities. The Perfect Passive Participle (hetoimasmenon, having been prepared) indicates a completed state of readiness. Human sinners are sent INTO a fire already prepared for supernatural beings (E214, updated to include etc5-12).

Mat 25:46 uses kolasis aionion — the penal-category noun in the accusative with the aionion adjective. Both aionion instances are A-ASF (E208, established etc5-08). The symmetry is an observable textual fact; what it implies about duration is governed by N034 (duration determined by referent's nature) and IB012 (Moderate toward referent-nature interpretation, etc5-08).

### VIII. Wailing and Gnashing Passages

All seven wailing-and-gnashing passages (Mat 8:12; 13:42; 13:50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luk 13:28) describe emotional responses to condemnation using G2805 (klauthmos = weeping) and G1030 (brygmos = gnashing). Three place the response in "outer darkness," two in "furnace of fire" — physically incompatible settings for the same phenomenon, indicating parabolic imagery rather than literal eternal-state description.

None of these seven passages uses G928 or G929 (torment vocabulary). None uses the for-ever-and-ever formula. None specifies an eternal duration for the weeping and gnashing. The casting verbs are aorist (completed action); the emotional vocabulary describes the moment of condemnation and exclusion (E260, new this study).

### IX. Heb 2:14 — Katargeō for the Devil

Heb 2:14 uses G2673 (katargeō, Aorist Active Subjunctive in a purpose clause: "that he might destroy/render inoperative") to describe Christ's goal regarding "him that had the power of death, that is, the devil." G2673 is not G622 (apollumi = destroy) or G928 (basanizō = torment) — it is a distinct word meaning to render ineffective, abolish, or bring to nothing (E261, new this study).

The ECT and conditionalist readings both accommodate Heb 2:14: ECT reads katargeō as the breaking of the devil's power over death (his power is rendered inoperative, but his existence continues in the lake of fire); conditionalist reads katargeō as ultimately describing the complete abolition of the devil (1 Cor 15:24-26 uses the same word for the complete destruction of all rule and the last enemy death). The purpose clause describes the goal; whether that goal is partial (power-rendered-inoperative) or complete (existence brought to nothing) is not resolved by the verb alone.

### E Items (Explicit Statements)

**New items from this study:**

| ID | Explicit Statement | Reference | Classification |
|----|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| E259 | Rev 19:20 states the beast and false prophet were cast into the lake of fire ζῶντες (Present Active Participle of G2198 zao = "while alive/living"). The human remnant in the same verse (Rev 19:21) were "slain with the sword." Within the same narrative unit, the two supernatural entities receive alive-casting while the human armies are killed first. | Rev 19:20-21 | Neutral |
| E260 | The seven wailing-and-gnashing-of-teeth passages (Mat 8:12; 13:42; 13:50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luk 13:28) use G2805 (klauthmos = weeping) and G1030 (brygmos = gnashing) for emotional responses; three locate the response in "outer darkness," two in "furnace of fire," one with "hypocrites," one in "thrust out." No passage uses G928/G929 (torment vocabulary) or the for-ever-and-ever formula. The diverse, physically incompatible settings for the same formula indicate parabolic imagery; the emotional vocabulary describes response at the moment of condemnation without specifying eternal duration for the weeping and gnashing. | Mat 8:12; 13:42; 13:50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luk 13:28 | Neutral |
| E261 | Hebrews 2:14 uses G2673 (katargeō, Aorist Active Subjunctive 3rd Singular in a purpose clause: καταργήσῃ) — "in order that he might destroy/render inoperative" — for Christ's goal concerning the devil. G2673 appears 27 times in the NT; it is not G622 (apollumi = destroy fully/perish) and not G928 (basanizō = torment). The purpose clause describes the goal of Christ's incarnation and death; the specific verb leaves open whether the result is the devil's power-rendered-inoperative or his ultimate complete abolition (cf. 1 Cor 15:24-26 where katargeō describes complete destruction of "all rule and authority and power" and of "the last enemy"). | Heb 2:14 (G2673 katargeō parsing) | Neutral |

### N Items (Necessary Implications)

No new N items are established from this study. The subject differentiation pattern (supernatural entities receive torment language; human wicked receive death language) is observable as a textual pattern but requires the inference step that vocabulary choice reflects outcome distinction — placing it at I-A (IA019, already established) rather than N tier. The strict N-tier tests preclude adding it as a necessary implication without universal agreement across both positions and zero added concepts.

Existing N items cited:
- **N021** — Second death = lake of fire (updated Also In: etc5-12)
- **N033** — Torment and destruction vocabulary never co-applied to the same subject (updated Also In: etc5-12)

### I Items (Inferences)

#### I-A Items (Evidence-Extending)

No new I-A items. IA019 (established etc5-06) already systematizes the vocabulary-differentiation pattern:

- **IA019** — The two vocabulary sets describe different outcomes for different subjects in Revelation. Updated: Also In field to include etc5-12.

#### I-B Items (Competing-Evidence)

**IB008 — Update (no resolution change):**
The torment language of Rev 20:10 and Rev 14:10-11 applies to specific defined entities (three named supernatural entities; a tribulation-era class). Rev 20:15 casts the generic human wicked into the same lake without repeating the formula. IB008's Moderate resolution (AGAINST universal extension) is reinforced by the etc5-12 evidence: the same author, in the same chapter, in adjacent verses, uses the torment formula for named supernatural entities (v.10) and plain cast-in language for the human wicked (v.15). Updated: Also In field to include etc5-12.

**IB014 — Update (no resolution change):**
The "no rest day nor night" phrase in Rev 14:11 identified in IB014 (Moderate toward judgment-process, etc5-11) remains unchanged. The evidence from etc5-12 that confirms IB014's Moderate resolution: E256 (formula distribution), IB009 (Babylon's smoke = completed destruction), and the absence of the no-rest phrase from Rev 20:10's torment formula. Updated: Also In field to include etc5-12.

**IB015 — New Item:**

**Claim:** The for-ever-and-ever formula (εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων) at Rev 20:10, applied directly to the active torment verb βασανισθήσονται ("shall be tormented") for three named supernatural entities, carries the same literary-formula / permanent-judgment meaning established by IB009 (STRONG) for the formula applied to ascending smoke nouns (Rev 14:11; Rev 19:3).

**FOR (literary formula / permanent-but-not-necessarily-perpetual-conscious reading):**
- E256 (Neutral): The same formula appears in Revelation 11 times for God/Christ/redeemed (inherently endless referents) and 3 times in judgment contexts including for Babylon's completed destruction.
- IB009 (STRONG): Rev 19:3 uses the identical formula (same author, same book) for Babylon — described as "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21). This is the #4a SIS demonstration: the formula can describe completed, permanent judgment.
- N034 (Neutral): Duration of any "for ever" expression is contextually determined by the nature of the referent, not by the word itself.
- The subjects (devil, beast, false prophet) are supernatural/apocalyptic entities whose mode of judgment may not be identical to the mechanism applied to mortal humans.

**AGAINST (the direct-verb application differs from the smoke-noun cases):**
- E149 (ECT): The text uses the torment verb basanisthesontai directly — not a smoke noun derived from a completed event. The three entities are stated as the explicit grammatical subjects of an active future torment.
- E212 (Neutral): The three entities are named supernatural entities; their stated experience is torment (G928), not death or destruction.
- The within-book demonstration (IB009) shows the formula for Babylon's smoke = completed destruction. But Babylon is described with completed-destruction language in the immediate context (Rev 18). The three supernatural entities of Rev 20:10 are not described elsewhere in Revelation with completed-destruction language; the beast's "going into perdition" (Rev 17:8,11 = E179) uses apoleia vocabulary but does not clearly specify the mechanism.

**SIS connections:**
- FOR: Rev 19:3 (#4a: same author, same book, identical formula, within 10 chapters) — governs the formula's capacity to describe permanent judgment rather than ongoing conscious experience.
- FOR: Rev 4:8 (same author, same book: same "day and night" expression for continuous activity of the living creatures — IB014's SIS) — demonstrates the "day and night" duration language is not inherently endless-conscious-suffering language.
- AGAINST: No within-book parallel where the formula is applied to a torment verb for defined conscious entities and clearly means completed destruction (rather than ongoing torment). The Babylon analogy is for a smoke noun, not a torment verb.

**Resolution: Moderate — weight toward permanent/irrevocable torment of specific supernatural entities, with the IB009 within-book demonstration preventing Strong ECT resolution.**

The weight is Moderate (not Strong) in the ECT direction because:
1. IB009's within-book demonstration (Rev 19:3) genuinely prevents certainty that the formula requires ongoing conscious perpetual experience even when applied to a torment verb.
2. The subjects' supernatural/apocalyptic nature introduces uncertainty about applying human-mortality assumptions to them.
3. The weight is Moderate (not Strong in the Conditionalist direction) because the verb-application is grammatically more direct than a smoke noun, and there is no within-book demonstration of the torment-verb-plus-formula being used for a demonstrably completed event.

**Classification:** Neutral (both sides have genuine textual evidence; the formula distribution and the verb-application each point different directions).

**First Appeared:** etc5-12

## Conclusion

The question was: Is the "tormented day and night for ever and ever" formula applied to human beings or to supernatural entities?

The textual answer is precise: the formula is applied to three named supernatural or apocalyptic entities — the devil, the beast, the false prophet — in Rev 20:10. The immediately adjacent verse (Rev 20:15) casts the generic human wicked into the same lake without repeating the formula. Revelation's own designation for the lake of fire when human beings are in view is "the second death" (Rev 20:14; 21:8) — death language, not torment language.

The torment vocabulary (G928 basanizō, G929 basanismos) across its entire NT distribution is confined to Revelation and appears in four contexts: (1) a five-month bounded judgment; (2) Babylon's completed "one-hour" judgment; (3) beast-worshippers (a specifically defined tribulation-era class, with IB009 STRONG governing the smoke-for-ever formula); and (4) the three named supernatural entities of Rev 20:10. The general mass of the human wicked in the Pauline epistles and throughout the NT receive destruction vocabulary (apollumi, apoleia, olethros), not torment vocabulary.

Whether the Rev 20:10 formula implies ongoing conscious perpetual experience for the three supernatural entities is addressed by IB015 (Moderate, new): the for-ever formula on an active torment verb for named supernatural entities does not have an offsetting within-book counter-demonstration the way the smoke-noun formula does (IB009 via Rev 19:3). The weight is Moderate toward permanent/irrevocable judgment of these specific supernatural entities. The IB009 within-book demonstration (Rev 19:3) prevents Strong resolution in either direction.

The primary question of this study — whether human beings are explicitly described as subject to the "tormented day and night for ever and ever" formula — receives a clear negative answer from the text itself: no NT passage applies the torment formula to the general human wicked in their final state. Human beings face "the second death," "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion, 2 Th 1:9), "everlasting punishment" (kolasis aionion, Mat 25:46), and "the lake of fire." The torment formula names specific non-human entities.

Both the ECT and conditionalist readings must engage with the subject differentiation. The ECT reading interprets the supernatural entities' torment as paradigmatic for all who enter the lake of fire. The conditionalist reading interprets the differentiated vocabulary as reflecting differentiated outcomes. The text does not provide an explicit bridge between the two: it describes different outcomes with different language for different subjects in adjacent verses, and leaves the relationship between those descriptions to be inferred.
