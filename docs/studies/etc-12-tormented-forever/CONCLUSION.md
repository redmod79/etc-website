# Tormented Forever (Rev 20:10)

## Question
What does Revelation 20:10 mean by "tormented day and night for ever and ever"? Who are the three named subjects? Is the "tormented for ever and ever" formula applied to human beings anywhere in Scripture, or only to the devil, beast, and false prophet? What does basanizo (G928) mean across its full NT usage? When humans enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8), what term does the text use? How does the text distinguish between the fate of the three named entities (Rev 20:10) and the fate of human beings (Rev 20:9, 14-15; 21:8)?

## Summary Answer
Revelation 20:10 names three subjects for "tormented day and night for ever and ever": the devil (a non-human supernatural spirit being), the beast (a symbolic apocalyptic entity -- rises from the sea, seven heads, ten horns, identified by a number, "was, and is not"), and the false prophet (a symbolic apocalyptic entity -- the second beast of Rev 13:11-17). None of the three is a literal human being. Tree 3 Gate 1 (Subject Gate) FAILS for all three. Tree 3 Gate 3 (Genre Gate) FAILS because Revelation is an apocalyptic vision (Nave's: VISION; Rev 1:1: semaino). The "tormented for ever and ever" formula (basanisthesontai eis tous aionas ton aionon) appears once in Scripture -- Rev 20:10 -- applied to these three non-human/symbolic entities. It is not applied to human beings anywhere in the Bible. When human armies face fire in the immediately preceding verse (Rev 20:9), the text uses "devoured" (katephagen) -- destruction vocabulary. When humans enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8), the text's own term is "the second death" -- death vocabulary, not torment vocabulary. Basanizo (G928) has a wide semantic range across its 12 NT occurrences: physical illness (Matt 8:6), waves tossing a boat (Matt 14:24), toiling at rowing (Mark 6:48), emotional distress (2 Pet 2:8), labor pains (Rev 12:2), demonic fear (Matt 8:29), divine judgment (Rev 14:10; 20:10). Seven of twelve uses are non-judgment contexts. All five judgment uses are in Revelation's apocalyptic framework or involve demons speaking of their own future. No epistle, no Gospel, and no OT passage applies basanizo/basanismos to the final fate of generic human wicked. Outside Revelation, the NT consistently uses destruction/death vocabulary for human judgment (apollymi, apoleia, olethros, thanatos, phthora).

## Key Verses
- **Rev 20:10** -- "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
- **Rev 20:9** -- "And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them." (human armies -- destruction vocabulary)
- **Rev 20:14-15** -- "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." (humans -- death vocabulary, no torment formula)
- **Rev 21:8** -- "But the fearful, and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." (eight categories of human wicked -- death vocabulary)
- **Rev 19:20-21** -- Beast and false prophet cast alive into lake (symbolic entities continue); human remnant "slain" (humans die)
- **Rev 13:1-2** -- Beast rises from sea, seven heads, ten horns -- symbolic entity
- **Rev 17:8** -- Beast "was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit" -- not a literal human being
- **Matt 25:41** -- "Everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels" -- fire prepared for non-human entities

## Evidence Classification

*Evidence items tracked in etc-master-evidence.md*

### INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY
- This study examines Rev 20:10 with focus on subject identification (devil, beast, false prophet), basanizo (G928) semantic range, vocabulary differentiation in Rev 20:7-15 (devoured vs. tormented vs. second death), Tree 3 Gate 1 (subject gate) and Gate 3 (genre gate) application, and the extension argument. The role is investigator, not advocate.
- Evidence is gathered from all sides. The surface reading of Rev 20:10 (ECT direction) is documented alongside subject-identification data, basanizo semantic-range data, and vocabulary-differentiation data.
- Statements below report what the text says and what the lexical/translation/parallel data shows. Interpretive inferences are classified separately.
- No editorial language is used.

#### Tree 3 Applications for Positional E-Items

All items classified as Conditionalist or ECT must pass all four gates of Tree 3.

**E30/E388 -- "Outside Revelation, NT uses destruction/death vocabulary for final fate of human wicked" -- Classified: Conditionalist**

- Step 1 Vocabulary Scan: V1 -- The collection of passages uses destroy, destruction, death, perdition, corruption, devour -- destruction/death vocabulary applied to human wicked. Candidate: Conditionalist.
- Step 2 Validation Gates:
  - Gate 1 (Subject): The passages describe literal human beings -- "soul and body" (Matt 10:28), "whosoever" (John 3:16), "them that know not God" (2 Thess 1:9), unbelievers generally (Rom 6:23), those on the "broad way" (Matt 7:13), "ungodly men" (2 Pet 3:7), "the adversaries" (Heb 10:27). All human subjects. PASS.
  - Gate 2 (Grammar): No ambiguity. Each passage uses standard destruction/death vocabulary in its plain lexical meaning. Apollymi = destroy/perish; olethros = ruin/death; thanatos = death; apoleia = destruction/perdition; phthora = corruption; katesthio = devour. PASS.
  - Gate 3 (Genre): The cited passages span didactic epistles (Rom 6:23; 2 Thess 1:9; Phil 3:19; Gal 6:8; Heb 10:27; 2 Pet 3:7), Gospel teaching (Matt 10:28; 7:13; John 3:16). All are didactic. PASS.
  - Gate 4 (Harmony): Consistent with all prior destruction-vocabulary E-items (E212-E267 from etc-06). The vocabulary chain is extensive: seven destruction words, LXX translation patterns, perish-vs-life contrasts across 5+ authors. No conflict with any E-item. PASS.
- All four gates passed. Classification: **Conditionalist.**

**Tree 3 for Rev 20:10 (E1/E125) -- Positional classification attempt:**

- Step 1 Vocabulary Scan: V2 -- "tormented day and night for ever and ever." Conscious-ongoing-existence vocabulary. Candidate: ECT. Proceed to Step 2.
- Step 2 Validation Gates:
  - Gate 1 (Subject): The devil (non-human spirit being), the beast (symbolic entity), the false prophet (symbolic entity). Automatic FAIL: "A non-human spirit being" and "A symbolic entity (a figure in an apocalyptic vision)." Record: "Subject is the devil (non-human supernatural being), the beast (symbolic entity), and the false prophet (symbolic entity), not literal human beings."
  - Gate 3 (Genre): Revelation is apocalyptic vision. Nave's: VISION (E349). Rev 1:1: signs (E350). FAIL: "Genre is apocalyptic vision."
- Step 3 Reclassification:
  - RC1: Gate 1 failure -- subjects are non-human/symbolic. Gate 3 failure -- apocalyptic vision.
  - RC2: Corrected observation: "In an apocalyptic vision, three non-human/symbolic entities (the devil, the beast, the false prophet) are described as tormented day and night for ever and ever in the lake of fire. These entities are not literal human beings. The text uses different vocabulary when describing human fate: 'devoured' (v.9), 'second death' (vv.14-15; 21:8)."
  - RC3: Re-enter V1/V2 -- The corrected observation does not yield a clean V2 (conscious-torment vocabulary applied to literal humans in didactic teaching). The torment formula is applied to non-human/symbolic entities in an apocalyptic vision. Neither V1 (destruction vocabulary) nor V2 (conscious-torment vocabulary) applies as positional evidence about literal human fate.
- **Result: Neutral.** Already classified Neutral in etc-05 and confirmed in etc-11. Both sides accept the text of Rev 20:10. The positional conclusion (whether the torment of these entities extends to humans) requires inference.

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The text distinguishes between the fate described for the three non-human/symbolic entities (tormented, v.10) and the fate described for human beings (devoured, v.9; second death, vv.14-15; 21:8) by using different vocabulary for each group | E1/E125 (tormented for devil/beast/false prophet), E5/E254 (devoured for humans), E6/E204 (second death for humans), E8/E377 (no torment formula for humans), E9/E378 (slain for humans, cast alive for symbolic) | Neutral | Both sides accept the textual observation that the passage uses different words for different subjects. The observation does not itself determine whether the distinction is significant for human fate -- that is inference-level. | N053 |
| N2 | Basanizo (G928) is not a technical term for eschatological eternal punishment because 7 of 12 uses are non-judgment contexts (illness, waves, rowing, distress, childbirth, demonic fear) and one judgment use has an explicit 5-month time limit | E10/E206 (wide semantic range), E11/E379 (7 of 12 non-judgment), E13/E362 (5-month limit) | Neutral | The distribution data is observable. Both sides accept that basanizo means "pain/toil/toss/vex" as well as "torment." Both sides accept Rev 9:5's 5-month limit. | N054 *NEW* |
| N3 | The "tormented for ever and ever" formula (Rev 20:10) is applied in Scripture only to the devil, beast, and false prophet -- never to human beings | E17/E382 (formula once, these subjects only), E18/E383 (no epistle/Gospel/OT basanizo for human fate), E8/E377 (no torment formula for humans entering lake) | Neutral | Both sides can verify the distribution: the specific formula "tormented day and night for ever and ever" appears once and names three non-human/symbolic subjects. No instance applies this formula to humans. | N055 *NEW* |

**N-tier verification (3-question test applied to each):**

- **N1/N053:** Already verified in etc-11. (1) Both sides accept different vocabulary for different subjects. YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N2/N054:** (1) Both sides accept the translation data (pain, toil, toss, vex) and the 5-month limit in Rev 9:5. YES. (2) One meaning: the distribution is a fact. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N3/N055:** (1) Both sides can verify that the formula appears once and names three non-human/symbolic subjects. ECT scholars may argue the formula extends to humans by inference, but they do not deny the textual observation about what the formula says and to whom. YES. (2) One meaning: the formula's application is verifiable. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| I1 | The "tormented for ever and ever" fate described for the devil, beast, and false prophet in Rev 20:10 applies equally to all unsaved humans who enter the lake of fire | I-C | ECT-direction | E1/E125 (Rev 20:10 names devil, beast, false prophet as subjects of "tormented day and night for ever and ever"). E5/E254 (Rev 20:9: humans "devoured" by fire). E6/E204 (humans in lake of fire = "second death"). E8/E377 (Rev 20:15: humans cast in, no torment formula). E2/E205 (beast/false prophet symbolic). E3/E375 (devil non-human). N1/N053 (text uses different vocabulary for different subjects). N3/N055 (formula applied only to these three, never to humans). | The text names three subjects for the torment formula: the devil, the beast, and the false prophet. It does not state that humans experience the same. The text uses "devoured" for humans (v.9) and "second death" for humans (vv.14-15; 21:8). The claim adds "all unsaved humans experience this" -- the text does not say this. The claim requires treating "same destination = same experience" when the text provides different terminology for different subjects at that destination. | #1 (adding: "all unsaved humans experience what Rev 20:10 describes" -- not stated in text), #4b (cross-referencing Rev 20:15 to Rev 20:10 without textual warrant equating the human experience to the non-human/symbolic entities' experience) |
| I2 | The torment formula in Rev 20:10 is about non-human/symbolic entities in an apocalyptic vision and does not constitute a didactic teaching about the fate of literal human beings; human fate in the same passage is described as "devoured" and "second death" | I-A | Cond. | E1/E125 (three non-human/symbolic subjects). E2/E205 (beast/false prophet symbolic). E3/E375 (devil non-human). E4/E376 (beast "was, and is not"). E5/E254 (devoured for humans). E6/E204 (second death for humans).

E24/E349 (Revelation = VISION). E25/E350 (Rev 1:1 = signs). N1/N053 (different vocabulary for different subjects). N3/N055 (formula applied only to non-human/symbolic entities). All components from E/N tables. | This systematizes the subject-identification data, the vocabulary-differentiation data, and the genre data into a comprehensive claim about the scope of Rev 20:10. Every component is text-derived.

| I3 | Rev 20:10 proves that the lake of fire involves eternal conscious torment for all its inhabitants, because the torment formula is stated for entities in the lake, and humans are also cast into the lake | I-B | ECT-direction | FOR: E1/E125 (Rev 20:10: torment formula for entities in the lake). Rev 20:15 (humans cast into the same lake). AGAINST: E5/E254 (humans "devoured" in v.9). E6/E204 (humans = "second death"). E8/E377 (no torment formula for humans).

E2/E205, E3/E375, E4/E376 (subjects are non-human/symbolic). E24/E349, E25/E350 (apocalyptic genre). E30/E388 (outside Revelation, NT uses destruction/death for humans). | The claim requires: (a) treating "same destination = same experience" when the text provides different vocabulary for different subjects; (b) extending the torment formula from non-human/symbolic entities to all humans when the text does not make this extension; (c) reading apocalyptic vision language as literal didactic teaching about human fate; (d) overriding the text's own term for the human experience of the lake ("second death") with the term the text reserves for non-human/symbolic entities ("tormented"). | #1 (adding: same lake = same experience -- the text does not say this), #2 (choosing between "torment applies to all inhabitants" and "the text distinguishes subjects"), #3 (applying apocalyptic imagery as literal didactic teaching) |
| I4 | The fact that basanizo is anticipated by demons for their own judgment (Matt 8:29) and applied to the devil in Rev 20:10 indicates torment is specifically the fate of supernatural entities; human fate is consistently described with different vocabulary (destruction/death) | I-A | Cond. | E27/E385 (demons anticipate basanizo). E1/E125 (devil/beast/false prophet tormented). E12/E380 (all 5 judgment uses of basanizo in apocalyptic/demonic framework). E18/E383 (no basanizo for human fate outside Rev). E30/E388 (destruction/death vocabulary for humans). N2/N054 (basanizo not a technical eschatological term). N3/N055 (formula only for non-human/symbolic entities).

### I-B Resolution: I3 -- Rev 20:10 Proves Eternal Conscious Torment for All Lake-of-Fire Inhabitants

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E1/E125 (Rev 20:10 states three entities in the lake are tormented for ever and ever); Rev 20:15 (humans cast into the same lake)
- AGAINST: E5/E254 (humans "devoured" in v.9); E6/E204 (humans in lake = "second death"); E8/E377 (no torment formula for humans in v.15); E9/E378 (humans "slain" while symbolic entities "cast alive"); N1/N053 (different vocabulary for different subjects); N3/N055 (formula applied only to non-human/symbolic entities); E2/E205, E3/E375, E4/E376 (subjects are non-human/symbolic); E24/E349, E25/E350 (apocalyptic genre); E30/E388 (outside Revelation, destruction/death for humans)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E1/E125 (Rev 20:10 torment formula) | Ambiguous | Apocalyptic genre (Gate 3 FAIL). Subjects are non-human/symbolic (Gate 1 FAIL). Surface reading supports ECT for the named entities, but whether it extends to humans is not stated. |
| Rev 20:15 (humans in same lake) | Ambiguous | States humans are cast into the lake. Does not state they are tormented. Same-passage context immediately distinguishes vocabulary (v.9: devoured; v.10: tormented; v.14-15: second death). |
| E5/E254 (humans devoured) | Plain | Observable verb in same passage. Katephagen = devoured. Both sides accept this is what the text says for human armies. |
| E6/E204 (second death for humans) | Plain | The text's own term. "This is the second death" (v.14). Both sides accept this is the text's identification. |
| E8/E377 (no torment formula for humans) | Plain | Observable. Rev 20:15 does not contain basanizo or basanismos. |
| E9/E378 (slain vs. cast alive) | Plain | Observable. Rev 19:21 uses apektanthesan for humans; 19:20 uses zontes for beast/false prophet. |
| N1/N053 (different vocabulary) | Plain | Follows from the E-items cited. Observable pattern. |
| N3/N055 (formula only for non-human/symbolic) | Plain | Verifiable distribution fact. |
| E2/E205, E3/E375, E4/E376 (subject nature) | Plain | The beast's symbolic characteristics (7 heads, 10 horns, "was, and is not") are textually stated. The devil is identified as dragon/serpent/Satan. |
| E24/E349, E25/E350 (genre) | Plain | Nave's classification. Rev 1:1 text. |
| E30/E388 (destruction/death for humans outside Rev) | Plain | Multiple didactic passages across multiple authors. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 2 Ambiguous items (Rev 20:10 surface in apocalyptic genre with non-human/symbolic subjects; Rev 20:15 humans in same lake without torment language).
AGAINST: 10+ Plain items (humans devoured, second death for humans, no torment formula for humans, slain vs. cast alive, different vocabulary for different subjects, formula only for non-human/symbolic entities, subject nature data, genre, destruction/death vocabulary outside Revelation).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The Plain statements govern the Ambiguous ones. The same-passage evidence (Rev 20:9-15 itself) provides the interpretive context: the author uses "devoured" for humans (v.9), "tormented" for the three non-human/symbolic entities (v.10), and "second death" for humans (vv.14-15). This is the clearest type of SIS -- same passage, same author, same context. The didactic passages outside Revelation (Matt 10:28: destroy; Rom 6:23: death; 2 Thess 1:9: destruction; John 3:16: perish) constitute Plain evidence from a clearer genre (didactic > apocalyptic). The consistent destruction/death vocabulary for human fate across epistles and Gospels governs the reading of the apocalyptic passage.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
10+ Plain items on the AGAINST side (same-passage vocabulary differentiation, same-passage subject identification, formula distribution, genre, destruction/death vocabulary across didactic NT passages) versus 2 Ambiguous items on the FOR side (surface reading of Rev 20:10 in apocalyptic genre with non-human/symbolic subjects; shared destination observation without shared vocabulary). The claim that Rev 20:10 proves eternal conscious torment for all lake-of-fire inhabitants requires reading "same destination = same experience" when the text itself provides different terminology for different subjects at that destination.

- Each uses plain lexical meaning without adding concepts. Checked.
- E-items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Checked.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- One new Conditionalist item (E30/E388) has full Tree 3 documentation above. All four gates passed.
- Rev 20:10 (E1/E125): Tree 3 applied. Gate 1 FAIL (non-human/symbolic subjects). Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic vision). Reclassified Neutral. Confirmed from etc-05 and etc-11.
- All Neutral E-items are textual observations both sides accept.
- No E-items classified ECT.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- Each N-item follows unavoidably from cited E-items. Checked.
- Three N-tier tests applied to each. All pass (documented above).
- N1/N053 already verified in etc-11.
- N2/N054 and N3/N055 are Neutral because both sides accept the distribution observations.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1 (extension to all humans): Requires adding "all unsaved humans experience this" -- not in E/N tables -> external. But does not override any E/N -> I-C. Checked.
- I2 (Rev 20:10 about non-human/symbolic entities only): All components in E/N tables -> text-derived -> systematizing only -> I-A. Checked.
- I3 (same lake = same torment): E/N items on both sides -> text-derived -> I-B. Checked.
- I4 (basanizo = fate of supernatural entities): All components in E/N tables -> text-derived -> systematizing only -> I-A. Checked.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1 (I-C): Does not override any E/N statement (the text does not deny humans could experience torment) but extends beyond what the text states. I-C. Checked.
- I2 (I-A): Uses only E/N vocabulary and concepts -> aligns -> I-A. Checked.
- I3 (I-B): Requires "second death" to mean "torment" when the text distinguishes them; requires extending the torment formula beyond its stated subjects -> conflicts with some E/N items -> I-B. Checked.
- I4 (I-A): Uses only E/N vocabulary and concepts -> aligns -> I-A. Checked.

**Step E: Consistency checks.**
- I-A (I2, I4): Only require criterion #5 (systematizing) and optionally #4a (SIS). Confirmed.
- I-B (I3): Has E/N items on BOTH sides. Confirmed.
- I-C (I1): Does not override any E/N statement. Confirmed I-C (not I-D).

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- Rev 20:9 "devoured" applied to human interpretation of Rev 20:10: same passage, same author, adjacent verse. #4a verified.
- Rev 20:14-15 "second death" applied to lake-of-fire interpretation: same passage, same author. #4a verified.
- Rev 19:20-21 "slain" vs. "cast alive": same passage, same author. #4a verified.
- Matt 10:28 "destroy" / Rom 6:23 "death" / 2 Thess 1:9 "destruction" applied to human fate: didactic genre, multiple authors, consistent vocabulary chain. #4a verified (shared topic: human eschatological fate).

Rev 20:10 (E1/E125) classified Neutral: Gate 1 FAIL (non-human/symbolic subjects), Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic genre). 30 Neutral E-items are textual/distribution observations both sides accept. The I-B item (I056) was resolved Strong: 10+ Plain items (same-passage vocabulary differentiation, subject identification, formula distribution, genre, didactic NT destruction/death vocabulary) govern 2 Ambiguous items (surface reading and shared-destination inference). I-C item (I1/I054) extends Rev 20:10 to all humans -- the text does not make this extension.

|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| 2026-02-20 | etc-12 | E375-E389, N054-N055, I056-I058 | "Tormented Forever" study (38 items: 15 new E, 2 new N, 3 new I; plus 17 existing items with "Also In" updates). Dedicated analysis of Rev 20:10 subject identification, basanizo semantic range, and vocabulary differentiation. Three named subjects: devil (non-human), beast (symbolic: 7 heads, 10 horns, "was, and is not"), false prophet (symbolic: second beast of Rev 13). Tree 3 Gate 1 FAIL (all three non-human/symbolic). Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic vision). The "tormented for ever and ever" formula appears once in Scripture (Rev 20:10), applied only to these three entities. Human armies are "devoured" (v.9). Humans entering the lake = "second death" (vv.14-15; 21:8). No epistle, Gospel, or OT passage applies basanizo/basanismos to generic human wicked. Basanizo: 7/12 non-judgment; all 5 judgment uses in apocalyptic/demonic framework. One I-B item (I056) resolved Strong: 10+ Plain items govern 2 Ambiguous. I-C confirmed (I054): extension to humans not stated in text. Updated "Also In" for 17 existing items. |

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture Explicitly States or Necessarily Implies)

1. Rev 20:10 names three subjects for "tormented day and night for ever and ever": the devil, the beast, and the false prophet. The devil is a non-human supernatural spirit being (Rev 12:9; 20:2). The beast is a symbolic apocalyptic entity (rises from sea, seven heads, ten horns, identified by a number, "was, and is not" -- Rev 13:1; 17:8). The false prophet is a symbolic apocalyptic entity (the second beast of Rev 13:11-17). None is a literal human being.

2. Tree 3 Gate 1 (Subject Gate) FAILS for all three subjects of Rev 20:10. The devil is "a non-human spirit being" (automatic FAIL). The beast is "a symbolic entity (a figure in an apocalyptic vision)" (automatic FAIL). The false prophet is "a symbolic entity" (automatic FAIL). Tree 3 Gate 3 (Genre Gate) FAILS because Revelation is an apocalyptic vision (Nave's: VISION; Rev 1:1: semaino). Rev 20:10 cannot serve as positional evidence about the fate of literal human beings.

3. The "tormented for ever and ever" formula (basanisthesontai eis tous aionas ton aionon) appears once in Scripture -- Rev 20:10 -- applied to the devil, beast, and false prophet. It is not applied to human beings anywhere in the Bible.

4. The text of Rev 20:7-15 uses distinct vocabulary for distinct subjects: human armies are "devoured" (v.9, katephagen -- destruction vocabulary); the devil, beast, and false prophet are "tormented" (v.10, basanizo); death and hades are cast in as "the second death" (v.14); human wicked are "cast into the lake of fire" with no torment formula appended (v.15). Rev 21:8 names eight categories of human wicked and calls the lake "the second death" -- death terminology.

5. Basanizo (G928) has a wide semantic range: physical illness (Matt 8:6), waves tossing a boat (Matt 14:24), toiling at rowing (Mark 6:48), emotional distress (2 Pet 2:8), labor pains (Rev 12:2), demonic fear (Matt 8:29; Mark 5:7; Luke 8:28), divine judgment (Rev 14:10; 20:10). Seven of twelve uses (58%) are non-judgment contexts. The word is not a technical term for eschatological eternal punishment.

6. All five basanizo judgment uses are in Revelation's apocalyptic framework or involve demons speaking of their own future (Matt 8:29). No epistle, no Gospel, and no OT passage uses basanizo or basanismos for the final fate of generic human wicked.

7. Rev 19:20-21 maintains the same subject distinction: the beast and false prophet are cast "alive" (zontes) into the lake of fire; the human remnant were "slain" (apektanthesan). Symbolic entities continue; humans die.

8. Outside Revelation, the NT consistently uses destruction/death vocabulary for the final fate of human wicked: "destroy" (apollymi, Matt 10:28; John 3:16), "everlasting destruction" (olethros aionios, 2 Thess 1:9), "death" (thanatos, Rom 6:23), "destruction/perdition" (apoleia, Phil 3:19; 2 Pet 3:7; Matt 7:13), "corruption" (phthora, Gal 6:8), "devour" (katesthio, Heb 10:27).

9. Matt 25:41 states the everlasting fire was "prepared for the devil and his angels." Its primary designation is for supernatural entities. The punishment vocabulary for humans in Matt 25:46 is kolasis (punishment), not basanizo (torment).

10. Heb 2:14 states Christ came to "destroy" (katargeo) the devil -- destruction vocabulary applied even to the supernatural entity whose future judgment includes basanizo according to Rev 20:10.

## What CANNOT Be Said (Not Explicitly Stated or Necessarily Implied by Scripture)

1. **It cannot be said that Rev 20:10 teaches eternal conscious torment for human beings.** The three named subjects are the devil (non-human), the beast (symbolic), and the false prophet (symbolic). Tree 3 Gate 1 FAILS for all three. The "tormented for ever and ever" formula is applied to these entities, not to humans. When humans appear in the same passage, the vocabulary is "devoured" (v.9) and "second death" (vv.14-15; 21:8).

2. **It cannot be said that "same destination = same experience."** The text itself provides different vocabulary for different subjects at the same destination (the lake of fire). The devil/beast/false prophet are described with the torment formula. Humans are described with death terminology. The inference that all inhabitants share the same experience requires adding a concept the text does not contain.

3. **It cannot be said that basanizo is a technical term for eternal conscious punishment.** Seven of twelve uses are non-judgment (illness, waves, rowing, distress, childbirth, demonic fear). One judgment use has a five-month limit. The word covers physical suffering, labor exertion, emotional distress, and divine judgment. Its eschatological uses are confined to Revelation's apocalyptic framework.

4. **It cannot be said that the "tormented for ever and ever" formula is applied to humans anywhere in Scripture.** The formula appears once (Rev 20:10) and names three non-human/symbolic entities. Rev 20:15 casts humans into the lake without the formula. Rev 21:8 names eight categories of human wicked and calls the lake "the second death." Extending the formula to humans is an inference (I-C), not a textual statement.

5. **It cannot be said that the Bible uses torment vocabulary for the final fate of human wicked outside Revelation.** No epistle, no Gospel, and no OT passage applies basanizo or basanismos to generic human judgment. The consistent vocabulary across epistles and Gospels is destruction, death, perdition, corruption, perishing.

6. **It cannot be said that the extension of Rev 20:10 to humans is a necessary implication.** The text provides the opportunity to state the torment formula for humans (Rev 20:15; 21:8) and instead uses "second death." The text provides the opportunity to use basanizo for human fate across the NT and instead uses apollymi, olethros, thanatos, apoleia, phthora. The consistent choice to use different vocabulary when describing human fate is a textual observation.

---

## Conclusion

This study examined 31 explicit statements, 3 necessary implications, and 4 inferences regarding the subjects, vocabulary, and scope of Revelation 20:10.

1 explicit statement is classified Conditionalist: the observation that outside Revelation, the NT consistently uses destruction/death vocabulary for the final fate of human wicked (E30/E388). All four Tree 3 gates passed. 0 explicit statements are classified ECT. Rev 20:10 (E1/E125) is classified Neutral: Gate 1 FAIL (all three subjects are non-human or symbolic), Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic vision). 30 explicit statements are classified Neutral (textual observations, distribution data, genre classifications, vocabulary facts both sides accept).

0 necessary implications are positional. N054 (basanizo not a technical term) and N055 (torment formula only for non-human/symbolic entities) are Neutral distribution observations both sides accept. N053 (different vocabulary for different subjects) is Neutral, confirmed from etc-11.

2 I-A inferences systematize the E/N evidence: I057 (Rev 20:10 is about non-human/symbolic entities, human fate is "devoured"/"second death") and I058 (basanizo = supernatural fate, destruction/death = human fate). 1 I-B inference (I056: same lake = same torment for all inhabitants) was resolved Strong: 10+ Plain items (same-passage vocabulary differentiation, subject identification, formula distribution, genre, destruction/death vocabulary across didactic NT) govern 2 Ambiguous items (surface reading and shared-destination inference). 1 I-C inference (I054, from etc-11: extension of Rev 20:10 to all humans) is an external extension not stated in the text.
