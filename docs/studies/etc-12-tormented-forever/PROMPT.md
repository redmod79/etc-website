# Bible Study: Tormented Forever — Revelation 20:10 and the Final Fate of the Wicked

## Question

What does Revelation 20:10 mean by "tormented day and night for ever and ever"? Who are the specific named subjects? Is the explicit "tormented for ever and ever" formula applied to human beings or to supernatural entities (the devil, beast, false prophet)? Do other passages in Scripture describe ongoing conscious torment as the final state of human beings? How does the vocabulary of torment (basanizō/basanismos) relate to the vocabulary of destruction (apollumi/apoleia/olethros) when applied to the wicked?

**Key established evidence entering this study:**

*Directly relevant established items:*
- **E149** (Rev 20:10 — ECT: "The devil, beast, and false prophet are tormented day and night for ever and ever") — established etc5-05; revisited etc5-06, etc5-08, etc5-11
- **E212** (Rev 20:10 names three specific supernatural subjects; Rev 20:15 casts human wicked into lake without repeating torment formula) — Neutral, established etc5-08
- **E180** (Rev 20:9: nations surrounding the camp are "devoured" [kataphagō = consume/eat up]; adjacent v.10 uses torment language for three named entities) — Neutral, established etc5-06
- **E150** (Rev 14:10-11 — ECT: beast-worshippers tormented; smoke ascending for ever) — established etc5-05; IB009 upgraded to Strong in etc5-11 toward literary-formula/desolation reading
- **IB008** (universal-extension claim: does torment language for devil/beast/false prophet apply to all lake of fire inhabitants?) — Moderate AGAINST universal extension, established etc5-05
- **IB014** (the "no rest day nor night" phrase in Rev 14:11) — Moderate toward judgment-process reading, established etc5-11
- **IB009** (Isa 34:10 formula in Rev 14:11) — **STRONG** toward literary-formula/desolation imagery, upgraded etc5-11
- **N033** (basanizō/basanismos lexically distinct from destruction vocabulary — no NT text uses both for the same subject) — Neutral, established etc5-06
- **N021** (the second death IS the lake of fire — explicit textual identification) — Conditionalist, established etc5-03
- **E110** (Rev 20:14: "death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.") — Conditionalist
- **E111** (Rev 20:15: "Whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire") — Conditionalist
- **E113** (Rev 21:8: "the fearful, and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death") — Conditionalist
- **E118** (Mat 25:41: everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels) — Neutral
- **E119** (Mat 25:46: aionion kolasis / aionion zoen — both outcomes) — Neutral
- **E208** (Mat 25:46: both aionion instances grammatically identical A-ASF) — Neutral, etc5-08
- **E209** (Mat 25:46: noun is kolasis = penal infliction, NOT basanismos = torment) — Neutral, etc5-08
- **E214** (Mat 25:41: fire prepared FOR [dative] devil and his angels — supernatural intended recipients) — Neutral, etc5-08
- **IA019** (two vocabulary sets describe different outcomes for different subjects in Revelation) — Conditionalist, etc5-06

**What etc5-11 established (immediately prior):**
- IB009 upgraded to **Strong** toward literary-formula/desolation on the basis of Rev 19:3 (E250) — the identical smoke-for-ever formula applied within Revelation to Babylon's completed destruction
- IB014 added — "no rest day nor night" (Rev 14:11) = Moderate toward judgment-process reading (Rev 4:8 same-phrase parallel)
- E256 — the "for ever and ever" formula (eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn) in Revelation: 11 applications to God/Christ/redeemed; 3 in judgment contexts (Rev 14:11, Rev 19:3, Rev 20:10)

**How etc5-12 differs from etc5-11:**
- etc5-11 analyzed the smoke/fire imagery of Rev 14:11 and its OT source (Isa 34:10); focus was on the smoke formula
- etc5-12 focuses on **Rev 20:10 specifically**: the explicit torment formula applied to three named subjects (devil, beast, false prophet); the subject differentiation between v.10 (named supernatural entities) and v.15 (generic human wicked); and whether other passages establish ongoing conscious torment as the final state for human beings

| G930 | basanistes | torturer; tormentor | Mat 18:34 |

**Key findings on G928/G929 (basanizō/basanismos) distribution:**
- G928 (12 NT occurrences): Eschatological uses confined to Revelation — Rev 9:5; Rev 14:10; Rev 20:10
- G929 (6 NT occurrences, ALL in Revelation): Rev 9:5 (5-month bounded torment); Rev 14:11; Rev 18:7; Rev 18:10; Rev 18:15 (three uses describing Babylon's completed sudden judgment); *Note: Rev 18:10,15 use "torment" noun in context of "one hour" judgment*
- G2851 (kolasis, 2 NT occurrences only): Mat 25:46; 1Jn 4:18 — NOT the torment word; designates penal infliction/punishment (from kolazo = to prune/curtail)

**Eternal/forever vocabulary:**

| Strong's | Word | Definition | Relevance |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| G165 | aiōn | age; perpetuity | Rev 20:10 uses "eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn" (G165 × 2); appears 128× in NT |

| G4442 | pyr | fire | 70 NT occurrences; prominent in Revelation judgment contexts |

**Destruction vocabulary (for comparison):**

| Strong's | Word | Definition | Key Occurrences |
|----------|------|-----------|----------------|
| G622 | apollumi | to destroy fully; to perish | 92 NT occurrences; Jhn 3:16; Mat 10:28; Rom 2:12; etc. |
| G684 | apoleia | ruin/loss; perdition, destruction | 20 NT occurrences; Mat 7:13; Php 3:19; 2Th 2:3; Rev 17:8,11 |
| G3639 | olethros | ruin, destruction | 4 NT occurrences: 1Th 5:3; **2Th 1:9**; 1Ti 6:9 |
| G2288 | thanatos | death | 119 NT occurrences; **Rev 20:14** (second death = lake) |

**Key lexical fact established:** G928/G929 (torment vocabulary) and G622/G684/G3639 (destruction vocabulary) NEVER appear together describing the same subject in the same passage. N033 (established etc5-06) — observable distributional fact.

## Focus Areas

*Derived from tool discoveries and established etc5 evidence:*

### Focus Area 1: The Three Named Subjects of Rev 20:10

**The central question this study must investigate:** Rev 20:10 explicitly names three subjects of "tormented day and night for ever and ever" — the devil (diabolos), the beast (to therion), and the false prophet (ho pseudoprophetes). These are:
- The devil: a supernatural being, identified with Satan (Rev 20:2), the old serpent (Rev 12:9; 20:2), the adversary (1Pe 5:8); bound for a thousand years and then released (Rev 20:1-7)
- The beast: the political/apocalyptic entity of Rev 13; already cast into the lake at Rev 19:20 — "before" the devil arrives in Rev 20:10
- The false prophet: the second beast of Rev 13:11-18; also cast in at Rev 19:20

**Key fact from tool data (E212):** The immediately following verse (Rev 20:15) casts "whosoever was not found written in the book of life" into the lake of fire WITHOUT repeating "tormented day and night for ever and ever." Two different subjects in adjacent verses receive two different descriptions.

**The research agent must:**
- Retrieve the full Greek text of Rev 20:7-15 (the complete narrative unit)
- Identify grammatically who the subjects of basanisthesontai (Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural) are in v.10
- Compare the language of v.10 (torment formula) with v.15 (cast in, no torment formula)
- Compare with Rev 19:20 (beast and false prophet cast alive into lake) — what does "alive" (zontes) mean here?
- Analyze the supernatural character of the three named entities vs. the human wicked (v.15)

### Focus Area 2: The Lake of Fire — Second Death (Already Established N021)

**What is already established:**
- N021: The second death IS the lake of fire (Rev 20:14 explicit: "This is the second death")
- E110: Death and hades are cast into the lake — hades ends when cast in
- E111: Human wicked cast into the lake (Rev 20:15) = second death
- E113: Rev 21:8 — lake of fire = second death (explicit)

**What this study adds:** Does the description of the lake as "second death" (for human wicked) harmonize or conflict with the description of the lake as the place of ongoing torment (for the devil/beast/false prophet)? Is "second death" language used for the human wicked while torment language is reserved for the supernatural entities?

**The research agent must:**
- Retrieve full text of Rev 20:7-15 with context (Rev 19:20 through Rev 21:8)
- Confirm the textual structure: death/hades end at the lake (v.14); human wicked cast in at v.15 using "second death" language; devil/beast/false prophet get torment language (v.10)
- Note the vocabulary distinction: death language for human wicked; torment language for the named supernatural entities

### Focus Area 3: Comparison with Mat 25:41,46 — Everlasting Fire and Punishment

**Already established items:**
- E118 (Mat 25:41): "everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels" — Neutral; named recipients are supernatural
- E119 (Mat 25:46): "everlasting punishment [aionion kolasin]... eternal life [zoen aionion]" — Neutral
- E208 (Mat 25:46): Both aionion instances grammatically identical (A-ASF)
- E209 (Mat 25:46): The noun kolasis = penal infliction (NOT basanismos = torment); only 2 NT occurrences
- E214 (Mat 25:41): Fire prepared FOR [dative] devil and his angels — dative of purpose, supernatural intended recipients

**New investigation needed:** Does Mat 25:41,46 add a new explicit "ongoing torment for human beings" item to the evidence base? The ECT reading says "everlasting punishment" = ongoing conscious torment for all judged wicked. The conditionalist reading says "everlasting punishment" = aionios kolasis = the permanent/irrevocable penal outcome (destruction), not specifically torment.
- G2851 (kolasis): 2 NT uses only; Mat 25:46 and 1Jn 4:18 — designates the category (punitive), not the mechanism
- Compare: "the fire was prepared for the devil and his angels" (v.41) — same subject-identification pattern as Rev 20:10

**The research agent must:**
- Retrieve full Greek text of Mat 25:31-46 (entire sheep/goat judgment)
- Run Greek parsing on Mat 25:41 and Mat 25:46 (key terms: hetoimasmenon, kolasin aionion, zoen aionion)
- Note whether the humans (nations, "these") are given the same "torment" word as the devil, or a different word (kolasis)

### Focus Area 4: The "Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth" Passages

**Tool discovery:** Nave's HELL entry references Mat 8:11-12; 13:42,50; 22:13; 25:30; LUK 13:28 — all "wailing and gnashing of teeth" texts.

**Key question:** Do these passages describe ongoing eternal conscious torment in the final state, or the moment of judgment/exclusion? The Greek term klauthmos (wailing) and brygmos (gnashing) describe an emotional response — but to what? At what point? And for how long?

**The research agent must:**
- Retrieve all "wailing and gnashing of teeth" passages (Mat 8:12; 13:42,50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luk 13:28)
- Identify the context: are these final-state descriptions or moment-of-judgment descriptions?
- Run Greek lookups: G2805 (klauthmos = weeping/wailing) and G1030 (brygmos = gnashing)
- Note the "outer darkness" pattern (Mat 8:12; 22:13; 25:30): darkness suggests absence/exclusion rather than ongoing fiery torment

### Focus Area 5: Vocabulary Differentiation — Torment vs. Destruction for Human Wicked

**Tool-confirmed distribution (N033, IA019, already established):**
- G928/G929 (basanizō/basanismos) in eschatological Revelation contexts: Rev 9:5 (5-month bounded); Rev 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers, IB009 = Strong toward literary-formula); Rev 18:7,10,15 (Babylon = "in one hour" completed judgment); Rev 20:10 (devil/beast/false prophet — the primary text of this study)
- G622 (apollumi), G684 (apoleia), G3639 (olethros) for human wicked broadly: Mat 10:28; Jhn 3:16; Rom 2:12; 2Th 1:9; 2Pe 3:9; etc.

**Key new finding from this study's tool research:** G929 (basanismos, 6 NT occurrences, ALL in Revelation) — three of the six uses describe Babylon's one-hour judgment (Rev 18:7,10,15); one describes the 5-month bounded scorpion torment (Rev 9:5); one describes the beast-worshippers' smoke (Rev 14:11); one is absent from the Strong's count (note: Rev 20:10 uses G928 basanizō, the verb form, not G929 the noun form, confirmed by E212 and prior Greek parsing).

**The research agent must:**
- Confirm which form (verb G928 or noun G929) is used in Rev 20:10 (Greek parsing)
- Run Greek parsing of Rev 20:10: identify the verb form (basanisthesontai = Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural of G928)
- Retrieve full text comparison: destruction language passages for human wicked vs. torment language passages for named entities
- Check 2 Thess 1:9: "shall be punished with everlasting destruction [olethron aionion] from the presence of the Lord" — olethros, not basanismos

### Focus Area 6: Jude 1:6 and 2 Pet 2:4 — Supernatural Being Confinement

**Tool discovery from SATAN entry:** Jude 1:6; REV 20:1-3,7,8,10 listed under Satan's judgment passages.

**Established context:** The angels of Jude 1:6 and 2 Pet 2:4 are supernatural beings kept in chains/pits awaiting judgment. The language used for their confinement is different from the language used for human wicked. This is relevant to the subject-differentiation question in Rev 20:10: if supernatural beings receive distinctive judgment language throughout Scripture, the application of "tormented day and night for ever and ever" to the devil/beast/false prophet may reflect the distinctive treatment of supernatural rebellious beings, not a description of the human dead's final state.

**The research agent must:**
- Retrieve Jude 1:6 and 2 Pet 2:4 with context
- Retrieve Rev 20:1-3 (binding of Satan) with context
- Note the language used for supernatural being confinement vs. human judgment

### Focus Area 7: Rev 19:20 — Beast and False Prophet Cast Alive into the Lake

**Tool discovery:** Rev 19:20 uses G3041 (limnē = lake) and appears as a Nave's reference for the LAKE entry. This is the first mention of the lake of fire with specific named subjects.

**Key question:** Rev 19:20 says the beast and false prophet are "cast alive [zontes] into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." The word "alive" (zontes = present active participle of zaō) may imply they are conscious when cast in. Does this support ECT for supernatural entities, and does it say anything about human beings?

**The research agent must:**
- Retrieve Rev 19:17-21 with context
- Look up G2198 (zaō = to live; zontes = living/alive)
- Note the parallel between Rev 19:20 (beast and false prophet cast in alive) and Rev 20:10 (devil cast in; all three are then tormented)

## Greek Parsing to Run

```bash
# Rev 20:10 — the central verse
python greek_parser.py --verse "REV 20:10"

# Rev 20:14-15 — second death / human wicked cast in
python greek_parser.py --verse "REV 20:14"
python greek_parser.py --verse "REV 20:15"

# Rev 19:20 — beast and false prophet cast "alive" into lake
python greek_parser.py --verse "REV 19:20"

# Mat 25:41 — everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
python greek_parser.py --verse "MAT 25:41"

# Mat 25:46 — everlasting punishment vs. eternal life
python greek_parser.py --verse "MAT 25:46"

# Rev 21:8 — second death confirmation
python greek_parser.py --verse "REV 21:8"
```

## Key Questions for the Analysis Agent

1. **Subject specificity:** Does Rev 20:10 apply "tormented day and night for ever and ever" to all inhabitants of the lake of fire, or only to the three named supernatural entities? What does the immediately adjacent Rev 20:15 (no torment formula for human wicked) imply about scope?

2. **Nature of the subjects:** Are the devil, beast, and false prophet supernatural entities of a fundamentally different nature than human beings? Does the text treat them differently in Rev 20 (compare: nations of v.9 = devoured; human wicked of v.15 = cast in with second-death language; supernatural three of v.10 = tormented formula)?

3. **The "for ever and ever" formula:** E256 established that this formula appears 3 times in judgment contexts (Rev 14:11; Rev 19:3; Rev 20:10) and 11 times for God/Christ/redeemed. IB009 (Strong) established that Rev 19:3 uses the identical formula for Babylon's completed destruction. Does the Rev 19:3 demonstration (same formula = completed destruction in same book) also govern Rev 20:10, or are there meaningful differences between the application of the formula to Babylon (Rev 19:3) and to the devil/beast/false prophet (Rev 20:10)?

4. **Mat 25:41,46:** Does the "everlasting punishment" of Mat 25:46 (using kolasis, not basanismos) add a new ECT-direction item for human beings to the evidence base? Or does the noun choice (kolasis = penal infliction) leave the mechanism unspecified, consistent with either ECT or conditionalism?

5. **"Wailing and gnashing" passages:** Do the Matthew passages describe an ongoing eternal state of conscious suffering, or the moment of judgment and exclusion? Is "outer darkness" compatible with ongoing fiery torment?

6. **Vocabulary consistency test:** When Scripture speaks of the final fate of human beings broadly, does it use torment vocabulary (basanizō/basanismos) or destruction vocabulary (apollumi/apoleia/olethros)? Does the restriction of explicit torment vocabulary (G928/G929) to specific named supernatural entities and/or specific defined groups in Revelation bear on the question?

## Evidence Items to Update or Generate

**Items to UPDATE (add "etc5-12" to Also In field):**
- E149 (Rev 20:10 torment — ECT)
- E212 (Rev 20:10 three named subjects / Rev 20:15 no torment formula)
- E180 (Rev 20:9 devoured vs. Rev 20:10 tormented)
- E110, E111, E113 (second death = lake of fire)
- E118, E119, E208, E209, E214 (Mat 25:41,46 items)
- N021 (second death IS the lake of fire)
- N033 (basanizō/basanismos distinct from destruction vocabulary)
- IB008 (universal extension claim — Moderate AGAINST)
- IA019 (different vocabulary for different subjects in Revelation)
- E256 (for-ever-and-ever distribution in Revelation)

**New items to generate (E259+, N042+, IB015+):**
The research and analysis agents will discover what new items arise. Likely candidates:
- New E items from Greek parsing of Rev 20:7-15 (confirming subject specificity, verbal forms, sequential structure)
- New E item from Rev 19:20 (beast/false prophet cast in "alive" — zontes)
- Possible new IB item: whether the for-ever-and-ever formula of Rev 20:10 (for named supernatural entities) is governed by Rev 19:3 (same formula = completed destruction) or whether the supernatural nature of the three entities creates a different case
- New E items from "wailing and gnashing" Greek parsing
- Possible new N item from vocabulary consistency test (if the data confirm that destruction vocabulary is used for human wicked throughout the NT, with torment vocabulary exclusively in Revelation for specific supernatural/defined groups)

## Research Instructions

You are the Research Agent for etc5-12-tormented-forever. Execute this study by:

1. Read SKILL.md at `C:/Users/Michael/.claude/skills/bible-study2/SKILL.md` for tool documentation and principles
2. Read your agent instructions at `C:/Users/Michael/.claude/skills/bible-study2/agents/research-agent.md`
3. Follow the **answer-question** workflow
4. Read the master evidence file at `D:/bible/bible-studies/etc5-master-evidence.md` to understand all established items — do NOT re-debate resolved items
5. Read the series methodology at `D:/bible/bible-studies/etc5-series-methodology.md`

**Priority tasks for the research agent:**
- Retrieve full text of Rev 20:7-15 (and Rev 19:17-21 for context) with verse-by-verse Greek text
- Run Greek parsing on Rev 20:10, Rev 20:14-15, Rev 19:20, Mat 25:41, Mat 25:46, Rev 21:8
- Run Strong's lookups for all numbers in the Strong's table above
- Retrieve all "wailing and gnashing of teeth" passages
- Retrieve Mat 25:31-46 complete
- Run cross-testament parallels for Rev 20:10 and Mat 25:46
- Retrieve 2 Thess 1:9 with context (olethron aionion — destruction language for human wicked)
- Retrieve Jude 1:6 and 2 Pet 2:4 with context (supernatural being confinement)

**Write research files to this folder:**
- `01-topics.md` — Nave's topics and full entries
- `02-verses.md` — All verse texts retrieved with context
- `04-word-studies.md` — Strong's research
- `raw-data/` — Raw tool output organized by category

**Do NOT write `03-analysis.md` or `CONCLUSION.md` — those are for the analysis agent.**

**Critical constraint:** This study is embedded in the ETC5 series with 340 accumulated evidence items. The research agent must:
- Report the text and parsing data faithfully without pre-judging the implications
- Note when a verse's language matches established ECT or conditionalist items
- Flag the subject-specificity question in Rev 20:10 vs. Rev 20:15 as the central textual finding for the analysis agent
- Do NOT re-open IB006 (Rich Man/Lazarus — resolved), IB009 (Isa 34:10 formula — resolved Strong), IB014 (no-rest phrase — resolved Moderate)
