# etc-12: Tormented Forever (Rev 20:10)

## Study Question

Rev 20:10 -- named subjects (devil, beast, false prophet). Applied to humans or supernatural/symbolic entities? Basanizo (G928) usage. Apply Tree 3 subject gate.

Specifically: What does Revelation 20:10 mean by "tormented day and night for ever and ever"? Who are the three named subjects? Is the "tormented for ever and ever" formula applied to human beings anywhere in Scripture, or only to the devil, beast, and false prophet? What does basanizo (G928) mean across its full NT usage? When humans enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8), what term does the text use? How does the text distinguish between the fate of the three named entities (Rev 20:10) and the fate of human beings (Rev 20:9, 14-15; 21:8)? Apply Tree 3 subject gate to Rev 20:10.

## Series Context

This is study 12 of 18 in the etc series ("The Final Fate of the Wicked"). Prior studies etc-01 through etc-11 have established ~503 items in the master evidence file. This study builds directly on etc-11 ("Smoke Ascending Forever") which analyzed Rev 14:9-11 and 19:3, and etc-08 ("Aionios") which analyzed the "ages of ages" formula.

**Key prior findings relevant to this study:**
- etc-11: Rev 20:9 uses "devoured" (destruction vocabulary) for human enemies. Rev 20:10 uses "tormented" for devil, beast, false prophet (latter two symbolic). When humans enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8), the term is "second death." The text distinguishes between these subjects. (N053, E125, E204, E254, E205)
- etc-11: Basanismos (G929) occurs 6 times, ALL in Revelation; 3 of 6 describe Babylon's completed destruction (E360, E361). Basanizo (G928) has a wide semantic range (E206).
- etc-11: Rev 14:10-11 Tree 3 Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic genre). Reclassified Neutral. I-B item I052 resolved Strong toward Conditionalist reading.
- etc-08: "Ages of ages" formula used ~19 times for God/Christ and only 3 times in judgment contexts, all in Revelation's apocalyptic framework (E314). I-B item I045 resolved Strong.
- etc-05: Beast and false prophet are symbolic entities in Revelation's apocalyptic framework (E205). Rev 20:10 subjects: devil (non-human), beast (symbolic), false prophet (symbolic). Gate 1 FAIL (E125 classified Neutral).

## INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY

- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by ECT proponents, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by conditionalists, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says. Do not use editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," "honestly acknowledge," or "non-intuitive reading." Simply state what each passage says and what each side infers from it.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- Never use language like "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.

## Research Areas

### A. Rev 20:10 -- The Primary Text

Analyze the three named subjects and the torment formula:

**Rev 20:10** -- "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."

Key questions:
1. Who are the three named subjects? What is each one's nature?
   - The devil (diabolos, G1228): A non-human spirit being (supernatural entity)
   - The beast (therion, G2342): A symbolic entity in Revelation's apocalyptic vision
   - The false prophet (pseudoprophetes, G5578): A symbolic entity in Revelation's apocalyptic vision
2. Apply Tree 3 Subject Gate: Is the grammatical subject a literal human being?
   - FAIL: The devil is a non-human spirit being. The beast and false prophet are symbolic entities.
3. Apply Tree 3 Genre Gate: Is this didactic prose?
   - FAIL: Revelation is an apocalyptic vision (Nave's: VISION; Rev 1:1: semaino/signs)
4. What is the grammatical subject of "shall be tormented" (basanisthesontai)?
   - The three named entities together. The verb is 3rd person plural future passive indicative.

**Rev 20:9** -- What vocabulary does the text use for human enemies immediately before v.10?
**Rev 20:14-15** -- What term does the text use when humans enter the lake of fire?
**Rev 21:8** -- What term does the text use for the eight categories of human wicked?
**Rev 19:20** -- The beast and false prophet are cast "alive" (zontes) into the lake of fire. What does this show about their nature?

### B. The Subject Differentiation Pattern in Rev 20:7-15

Document the vocabulary used for each group in the passage:
- v.9: Nations/human armies -- "devoured" (katephagen, G2719) -- destruction vocabulary
- v.10: Devil, beast, false prophet -- "tormented day and night for ever and ever" -- torment formula
- v.14: Death and hades -- "cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." -- death identity
- v.15: Human wicked ("whosoever not found written") -- "cast into the lake of fire" -- NO torment language appended

The text itself distinguishes between these subjects with different vocabulary.

### C. Basanizo (G928) -- Complete NT Usage

All 12 occurrences of basanizo in the NT:

| Verse | Subject | Translation | Meaning |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Matt 8:6 | Centurion's servant | "grievously tormented" | Physical illness/pain |
| Matt 8:29 | Demons speaking | "art thou come hither to torment us" | Demonic fear of judgment |
| Matt 14:24 | Ship/boat | "tossed with waves" | Waves buffeting a boat |
| Mark 5:7 | Demon speaking | "torment me not" | Demonic fear |
| Mark 6:48 | Disciples | "toiling in rowing" | Physical exertion/straining |
| Luke 8:28 | Demon speaking | "torment me not" | Demonic fear |
| 2 Pet 2:8 | Lot | "vexed his righteous soul" | Moral/emotional distress |
| Rev 9:5 | Locusts/humans | "they should be tormented" | Limited torment (5 months) |
| Rev 11:10 | Two prophets | "tormented them that dwelt on earth" | Prophetic witness = distress |
| Rev 12:2 | Woman | "pained to be delivered" | Childbirth/labor pains |
| Rev 14:10 | Beast-worshippers | "he shall be tormented" | Judgment in apocalyptic vision |
| Rev 20:10 | Devil, beast, false prophet | "shall be tormented" | Judgment of supernatural/symbolic entities |

Key observations from the data:
- Basanizo has a wide semantic range: physical illness (Matt 8:6), waves tossing a boat (Matt 14:24), toiling/rowing (Mark 6:48), emotional distress (2 Pet 2:8), labor pains (Rev 12:2), demonic fear (Matt 8:29), divine judgment (Rev 14:10; 20:10)
- The word is NOT exclusively an eschatological torment word
- Non-Revelation uses: 7 of 12 occurrences are NOT about eschatological judgment
- Revelation uses: 5 of 12 are in Revelation's apocalyptic framework
- When demons use basanizo (Matt 8:29; Mark 5:7; Luke 8:28), they speak of their own judgment -- they are supernatural entities, not humans
- Rev 9:5 uses basanizo with an explicit 5-month time limit
- The eschatological uses (Rev 14:10; 20:10) are all within apocalyptic genre

### D. Related Torment Word Family

**G929 basanismos** (noun, "torment") -- 6 occurrences, ALL in Revelation:
- Rev 9:5 (5-month time limit)
- Rev 14:11 (smoke of their torment)
- Rev 18:7, 18:10, 18:15 (Babylon's "torment" = her completed destruction)
Three of six describe Babylon's completed destruction. One has an explicit time limit.

**G931 basanos** (noun, "torment/touchstone") -- 3 occurrences:
- Matt 4:24 (physical diseases/pains)
- Luke 16:23 (rich man "in torments" -- parabolic)
- Luke 16:28 ("place of torment" -- parabolic)
NOT used in any eschatological judgment context. Luke 16 uses basanos, NOT basanizo/basanismos.

**G930 basanistes** (noun, "torturer/jailer") -- 1 occurrence:
- Matt 18:34 (parabolic -- delivered to the tormentors)

### E. The "For Ever and Ever" Formula -- Distribution and Application

The "eis tous aionas ton aionon" formula in Revelation:
- ~11 times for God/Christ/redeemed (doxological)
- Rev 14:11: "smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" (smoke noun)
- Rev 19:3: "her smoke rose up for ever and ever" (Babylon -- destroyed, "found no more")
- Rev 20:10: "shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever" (torment verb)

Rev 19:3 demonstrates the formula can describe a completed destruction event (Babylon is "utterly burned," "found no more at all" -- Rev 18:8,21). Same author, same book, same formula.

Rev 20:10 applies the formula directly to the torment verb rather than to ascending smoke. This is a structural distinction from Rev 14:11 and 19:3. However, the subjects are still not human beings.

### F. What the Text Says When Humans Enter the Lake of Fire

Every passage describing human beings and the lake of fire uses "death" terminology, not "torment" terminology:
- Rev 20:14: "This is the second death" (identity statement)
- Rev 20:15: "cast into the lake of fire" (no torment language added)
- Rev 21:8: "which is the second death" (identity statement for human wicked)

The text's own name for the lake of fire, when humans are the subject, is "the second death." The word used is thanatos (G2288) -- death. Not basanizo. Not basanismos.

### G. Therion (G2342) and Pseudoprophetes (G5578) -- Nature of the Subjects

**Therion (G2342)** -- 46 occurrences:
- Mark 1:13; Acts 10:12; 11:6; 28:4; Titus 1:12; Heb 12:20; Jas 3:7 -- literal wild animals
- Rev 6:8; 11:7; 13-20 -- the apocalyptic "beast" (38+ occurrences in Revelation)
- The Revelation "beast" is a symbolic entity: rises from the sea (13:1), has seven heads and ten horns, receives authority from the dragon (13:2), is identified by a number (13:18). Rev 17:8 says the beast "was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit." This is not a literal human being.

**Pseudoprophetes (G5578)** -- 11 occurrences:
- Matt 7:15; 24:11,24; Mark 13:22; Luke 6:26; Acts 13:6; 2 Pet 2:1; 1 John 4:1 -- generic false prophets (plural, a class of humans)
- Rev 16:13; 19:20; 20:10 -- THE false prophet (singular, specific apocalyptic figure paired with the beast)
- In Revelation, the false prophet is specifically the second beast of Rev 13:11-17, who works miracles, makes fire come down from heaven, and gives life to the image of the beast. He is a symbolic figure in the apocalyptic narrative, not a generic human false prophet.

**Diabolos (G1228)** -- 38 occurrences:
- The devil/Satan is consistently presented as a non-human spirit being throughout the NT
- Rev 12:9 identifies the devil as "that old serpent," "the dragon" -- symbolic identifications
- Rev 20:2 -- "the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan"
- A non-human supernatural entity

### H. Cross-References -- How Do Other NT Authors Describe the Fate of the Wicked?

When the NT describes the fate of human wicked outside Revelation, the vocabulary is consistently destruction/death, not torment:
- Matt 10:28: God can "destroy" (apollymi) soul and body in gehenna
- 2 Thess 1:9: "everlasting destruction" (olethros aionios)
- Rom 6:23: "wages of sin is death" (thanatos)
- Phil 3:19: "whose end is destruction" (apoleia)
- 2 Pet 3:7: "perdition" (apoleia) of ungodly men
- Gal 6:8: "reap corruption" (phthora)
- John 3:16: "not perish" (apollymi) but have everlasting life
- Matt 7:13: "broad way that leads to destruction" (apoleia)
- Heb 10:27: "fiery indignation which shall devour" the adversaries

No epistle, no Gospel, and no OT passage uses basanizo/basanismos for the final fate of generic human wicked. The torment formula is confined to Revelation's apocalyptic framework, and within that framework, the "tormented for ever and ever" formula (Rev 20:10) names only the devil, beast, and false prophet.

- Satan is consistently identified as a supernatural entity: "The angel of the bottomless pit," "Great red dragon," "That old serpent"

**BEASTS** (redirects to ANIMALS):
- Nave's does not have a separate entry for the Revelation "beast" as a theological category

**FIRE (Everlasting):**
- Listed under FIGURATIVE: "Of the destruction of the wicked MAT 13:42,50; 25:41; MRK 9:44; REV 9:2; 21:8"
- Nave's classifies fire in the judgment context under "the destruction of the wicked" -- destruction vocabulary, not torment vocabulary

## Analysis Instructions

### 1. Subject Analysis (Tree 3 Gate 1 Application)

Apply Tree 3 Gate 1 (Subject Gate) to Rev 20:10:
- Is the grammatical subject a literal human being?
- The devil (diabolos): Non-human spirit being. FAIL.
- The beast (therion): Symbolic apocalyptic entity (rises from sea, seven heads, ten horns). FAIL.
- The false prophet: Symbolic apocalyptic entity (second beast of Rev 13). FAIL.
- Automatic FAIL: "A non-human spirit being" and "A symbolic entity (a figure in an apocalyptic vision)"
- Record: "Subject is the devil (non-human spirit being), the beast (symbolic entity), and the false prophet (symbolic entity), not literal human beings."

### 2. Genre Analysis (Tree 3 Gate 3 Application)

Apply Tree 3 Gate 3 (Genre Gate) to Rev 20:10:
- Is this passage didactic prose?
- Revelation is an apocalyptic vision. Nave's classifies it under VISION. Rev 1:1 uses semaino (to signify by signs).
- FAIL: "Genre is apocalyptic vision."

### 3. Vocabulary Differentiation Analysis

Document the observable pattern that the text uses different vocabulary for different subjects:
- Humans in v.9: "devoured" (destruction)
- Devil/beast/false prophet in v.10: "tormented" (torment formula)
- Humans in v.14-15: "second death" (death terminology)
- Humans in 21:8: "second death" (death terminology)

### 4. Basanizo Semantic Range Analysis

Catalog all 12 occurrences with their actual meanings in context. Document that:
- The word is NOT a technical eschatological term
- 7 of 12 uses are non-judgment contexts
- All 5 judgment uses are in Revelation's apocalyptic framework
- When humans use basanizo for eschatological fear, the speakers are demons (Matt 8:29; Mark 5:7; Luke 8:28)

### 5. Cross-Reference Analysis

Compare the vocabulary used for human judgment across the NT:
- Outside Revelation: exclusively destruction/death vocabulary
- Inside Revelation: "second death" for humans, "tormented" only for devil/beast/false prophet
- No epistle, no Gospel, and no OT passage applies basanizo/basanismos to the final fate of generic human wicked

### 6. Extension Argument Analysis

Analyze the claim (I054) that the fate described for the devil, beast, and false prophet in Rev 20:10 applies equally to all unsaved humans:
- What the text says vs. what the claim adds
- Rev 20:15 casts humans into the lake of fire without repeating the torment formula
- Rev 21:8 names eight categories of human wicked and calls the lake "the second death"
- The claim requires adding what the text does not state
