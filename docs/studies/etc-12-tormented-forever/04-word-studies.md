5. **Rev 9:5 uses basanizo with an explicit 5-month time limit** -- the word itself does not inherently mean eternal
6. **Rev 11:10 uses basanizo for prophetic witness causing distress** -- the "torment" is the prophets' testimony, not fire

## Summary: The Nature of Rev 20:10's Three Subjects

| Subject | Strong's | Nature | Evidence |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|
| The devil | G1228 diabolos | Non-human supernatural spirit being | 38 NT occurrences; consistently a spirit being; Rev 12:9 = dragon/serpent/Satan |
| The beast | G2342 therion | Symbolic apocalyptic entity | Rises from sea, 7 heads, 10 horns, identified by number; "was, and is not" (Rev 17:8) |
| The false prophet | G5578 pseudoprophetes | Symbolic apocalyptic entity | = second beast of Rev 13:11-17; singular, specific Revelation figure; works miracles, gives life to image |

**None of the three subjects of Rev 20:10 is a literal human being.** The torment formula ("tormented day and night for ever and ever") is predicated of these three non-human/symbolic entities, not of human beings.
