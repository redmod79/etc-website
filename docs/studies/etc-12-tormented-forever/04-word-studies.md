## 1. Torment Vocabulary (G928, G929, G931)

### G928 — βασανίζω (basanizō) — The Torment Verb

**Lexical data:**
- Transliteration: basanizō
- Part of Speech: verb
- BLB count: 12 NT occurrences
- Definition: from G931 (basanos, a touchstone); to torture — to cause severe pain/distress; pain, toil, torment, toss, vex
- Etymology: basanos originally referred to a touchstone used to test precious metals; later extended to torture as a test/interrogation method

**All 12 NT occurrences with context:**

| Reference | Context | Translation | Subject of Torment |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Mat 8:6 | Centurion's servant "lying at home grievously tormented" | "grievously tormented" | Physical illness |
| Mat 8:29 | Demons cry: "Art thou come to torment us before the time?" | "to torment" | Supernatural beings |
| Mat 14:24 | Ship "tossed with waves" | "tossed" | Inanimate (ship) |
| Mrk 5:7 | Demoniac: "I adjure thee... that thou torment me not" | "torment... not" | Supernatural being |
| Mrk 6:48 | Disciples "toiling in rowing" | "toiling" | Physical exertion |
| Luk 8:28 | Demon: "I beseech thee, torment me not" | "torment me not" | Supernatural being |
| 2 Pet 2:8 | Lot "vexed his righteous soul" | "vexed" | Emotional distress |
| **Rev 9:5** | Scorpion-creatures torment people for 5 months | "they should be tormented" | Human beings (bounded: 5 months) |
| Rev 11:10 | Two witnesses "tormented them that dwelt on the earth" | "tormented" | Human beings |
| Rev 12:2 | Woman "pained to be delivered" | "pained" | Figurative labor pain |
| **Rev 14:10** | Beast-worshippers "he shall be tormented" | "he shall be tormented" | Human beings (specific group) |
| **Rev 20:10** | Devil, beast, false prophet "shall be tormented" | "shall be tormented" | Three named supernatural entities |

**Key distribution observations:**
1. G928 appears in supernatural contexts in Mat 8:29, Mrk 5:7, Luk 8:28 — demons asking not to be tormented by Christ. This establishes that supernatural beings use this vocabulary about their anticipated judgment.
2. The ESCHATOLOGICAL uses of G928 in Revelation (9:5; 14:10; 20:10) involve: bounded human torment (9:5); specific beast-worshippers (14:10, IB009 resolved); and three named supernatural entities (20:10).
3. G928 is NEVER used in the NT for the general undifferentiated mass of human wicked in their final state. It is not used in 2 Thess 1:9, Mat 7:13-14, Phil 3:19, or any epistolary description of human sinners' final fate.

**Greek parsing of Rev 20:10 key verb:**
βασανισθήσονται = V-FPI-3P = Future Passive Indicative 3rd Person Plural of G928
- Future: not yet occurring at the time of writing; will occur
- Passive: the torment is inflicted upon them (they receive it)
- 3rd Plural: the three named subjects (devil, beast, false prophet) are the grammatical referent

### G929 — βασανισμός (basanismos) — The Torment Noun

**Lexical data:**
- Transliteration: basanismós
- Part of Speech: masculine noun
- BLB count: 6 NT occurrences
- ALL 6 in Revelation — this word does NOT appear outside Revelation
- Definition: torture, torment (the state or act of being tormented)

**All 6 NT occurrences:**

| Reference | Context | Subject |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Rev 9:5 | Scorpion-creatures; torment bounded to 5 months | Human beings (bounded) |
| **Rev 14:11** | "Smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" | Beast-worshippers (IB009 Strong → literary-formula) |
| Rev 18:7 | Babylon's self-judgment: "so much torment and sorrow give her" | Babylon (conceptual) |
| Rev 18:10 | "Alas, alas that great city Babylon... for in one hour is thy judgment come" — context of "torment" | Babylon — "one hour" completed judgment |
| Rev 18:15 | Merchants "stand afar off for the fear of her torment" | Babylon (merchants observing) |

**Critical observation:** G929 (basanismos) does NOT appear in Rev 20:10. The torment of the devil/beast/false prophet is described with G928 (verb), not G929 (noun). This is a minor distinction but worth noting. More significantly:
- Three of the six G929 uses (Rev 18:7, 10, 15) describe Babylon's ONE-HOUR judgment — "torment" language is used for an event described elsewhere as sudden, completed destruction.
- One G929 use (Rev 9:5) is explicitly bounded (5 months).
- One G929 use (Rev 14:11) is the smoke-for-ever passage (IB009, resolved Strong toward literary-formula).
- These usages show that "torment/basanismos" in Revelation can describe a COMPLETED judgment event from the perspective of its intensity, not necessarily an ongoing infinite-duration state.

### G931 — βάσανος (basanos) — The Torment Noun (Older Form)

**Lexical data:**
- Transliteration: básanos
- Part of Speech: masculine noun
- BLB count: 3 NT occurrences
- Definition: originally a touchstone for testing metals; by extension, torture/torment

**All 3 NT occurrences:**

| Reference | Context | Setting |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Mat 4:24 | "Various diseases and torments" | Physical illness (non-eschatological) |
| Luk 16:23 | Rich man "in torments" (ἐν βασάνοις) | **Hades** (intermediate state) |
| Luk 16:28 | "This place of torment" (τοῦ βασάνου τούτου) | **Hades** (intermediate state) |

**Critical note:** G931 (basanos) appears in the Luke 16:23-28 Rich Man/Lazarus parable — the primary "pre-final-state" use of torment vocabulary. This describes the intermediate state (hades), NOT the final state after the lake of fire. IB006 (resolved Moderate toward parabolic reading; do NOT re-open). The use of G931 in the INTERMEDIATE state is distinct from G928/G929 in the FINAL judgment context.

## 2. G2851 — κόλασις (kolasis) — Punishment at Matthew 25:46

**Lexical data:**
- Transliteration: kólasis
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- BLB count: 2 NT occurrences (also in LXX: Ezek 14:3)
- Definition: from G2849 (kolazō = to prune/curtail; to punish); penal infliction — punishment, torment
- Etymology: kolazō originally meant "to prune trees" — to cut back, curtail. Extended to punishment as restriction/cutting-short.

**All NT occurrences:**

| Reference | Context | Translation |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Mat 25:46** | "shall go away into everlasting punishment" | punishment |
| 1 Jn 4:18 | "fear hath torment [kolasis]" | torment |

**The 1 Jn 4:18 usage is important:** "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment [kolasis]." Here kolasis refers to the EXPERIENCE of dread/punishment-anticipation — a present psychological state, not a final eschatological mechanism. This usage shows kolasis can describe a general punitive experience without specifying whether it involves ongoing consciousness.

**Mat 25:46 Greek parsing:**
- κόλασιν (G2851) = N-ASF (Accusative Singular Feminine) — the noun
- αἰώνιον (G166) = A-ASF (Accusative Singular Feminine) — the modifier
- Both in the accusative (object of εἰς = "into")
- "Everlasting punishment" as a phrase: the punishment (kolasis) is aionios (everlasting/pertaining to the age)

**Vocabulary contrast:**

| Noun | Strong's | Used in Mat 25:46? | Meaning | NT Count |
|------|----------|-------------------|---------|----------|
| kolasis | G2851 | YES | penal infliction (category/type) | 2 |
| basanismos | G929 | NO | torture/torment (mechanism/experience) | 6 |
| olethros | G3639 | NO | ruin/destruction | 4 |
| apoleia | G684 | NO | loss/destruction/perdition | 20 |

**Theological significance:** The choice of kolasis (rather than basanismos or zōē) in Mat 25:46 designates the outcome as PUNITIVE without specifying whether the mechanism is ongoing conscious torment or destruction. The ECT reading requires reading the mechanism (eternal conscious torment) into kolasis; the conditionalist reading requires reading the mechanism (eternal destruction) into kolasis. Neither reading follows unambiguously from the word alone. The word designates CATEGORY (punitive, from God, everlasting) — not the CONTENT of the experience.

## 3. G3041 — λίμνη (limnē) — Lake

**Lexical data:**
- Transliteration: límnē
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- BLB count: 10 NT occurrences
- Definition: probably from G3040 (through idea of nearness of shore); a pond or lake

**All 10 NT occurrences:**

| Reference | Context | Subject |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Luk 5:1 | Sea of Galilee | Natural lake |
| Luk 5:2 | Fishing boats at shore | Natural lake |
| Luk 8:22 | "Let us go over unto the other side of the lake" | Natural lake |
| Luk 8:33 | Swine "ran violently down a steep place into the lake" | Natural lake |
| **Rev 19:20** | Beast and false prophet cast alive into "lake of fire burning with brimstone" | Eschatological |
| **Rev 20:10** | Devil cast into "lake of fire and brimstone" | Eschatological |
| **Rev 20:14** | Death and hades cast into "lake of fire" = second death | Eschatological |
| **Rev 20:15** | Whosoever not in book of life cast into "lake of fire" | Eschatological |
| **Rev 21:8** | Human sinners' portion in "lake which burneth with fire and brimstone" = second death | Eschatological |

**Note:** The BLB count shows 10 occurrences; Luke 8:23 may be a variant not listed. The 4 natural lake occurrences in Luke are all of the same physical lake (Sea of Galilee = Lake Kinneret). All 6 eschatological occurrences are in Revelation; all 6 involve the "lake of fire" construction.

**The "lake of fire" subjects in Revelation:**

| Verse | Subject | Accompanying language |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| Rev 19:20 | Beast + false prophet | "alive" (ζῶντες) |
| Rev 20:10 | Devil (where beast + false prophet are) | "tormented day and night for ever and ever" |
| Rev 20:14 | Death + hades | "this is the second death" |
| Rev 20:15 | Human wicked ("whosoever") | [no additional qualifier] |
| Rev 21:8 | Eight human sin categories | "which is the second death" |

**Distribution of "second death" language:** Used for the human wicked (Rev 20:15 implied by context; Rev 21:8 explicit); NOT used for the devil/beast/false prophet in Rev 20:10. The devil/beast/false prophet get "tormented for ever"; the human wicked get "the second death."

## 4. "Second Death" — The Phrase and Its Components

**The phrase ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος ("the second death") in Revelation:**

| Reference | Context |
|-----------|---------|
| Rev 2:11 | "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death" |
| Rev 20:6 | "on such the second death hath no power" |
| **Rev 20:14** | "This is the second death" (= lake of fire) |
| **Rev 21:8** | "which is the second death" (= lake of fire) |

**Components:**
- G2288 (thanatos) = death — the primary word for death in the NT (119 occurrences); the same word used for biological death throughout the NT
- G1208 (deuteros) = second — ordinal numeral indicating sequence/distinction

**The identity equation (Rev 20:14; 21:8):**
- "οὗτος ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός ἐστιν, ἡ λίμνη τοῦ πυρός" (Rev 20:14) = copulative equation: the second death IS the lake of fire
- "ὅ ἐστιν ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος" (Rev 21:8) = relative clause: which IS the second death

**Theological significance of the death-language:**
1. The use of DEATH language (not torment language) for the human wicked's final state suggests that the lake of fire represents a form of DEATH — a final, definitive end to life — not a state of ongoing conscious torment.
2. In Rev 20:6, the first-resurrection saints are told the "second death hath no power" over them — they have already died and been resurrected to immortality. The second death's power over the wicked suggests something corresponding to what death does.
3. The double-identity statement (lake of fire = second death, appearing at both Rev 20:14 and Rev 21:8) is emphatic — the text goes out of its way to tell the reader what the lake of fire IS for the human wicked. Its name is "the second death," not "eternal torment."

**Contrast with how the devil is described:**
- Devil (Rev 20:10): tormented day and night for ever and ever — TORMENT language
- Human wicked (Rev 20:15; 21:8): second DEATH — DEATH language

## 5. Vocabulary Differentiation Table

### Torment Vocabulary vs. Destruction Vocabulary for Wicked in NT

**Torment vocabulary (G928/G929/G931):**

| Passage | Vocabulary | Subject | Duration/Scope |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Mat 8:29; Mrk 5:7; Luk 8:28 | G928 (demons asking not to be tormented) | Supernatural beings (pre-judgment) | Anticipatory |
| Rev 9:5 | G928/G929 | Human beings | BOUNDED: 5 months explicit |
| Rev 14:10-11 | G928/G929 | Beast-worshippers | IB009 STRONG → literary-formula |
| Luk 16:23, 28 | G931 | Rich man (parable) | Intermediate state (hades), pre-final |
| **Rev 20:10** | **G928 (verb)** | **Devil, beast, false prophet (supernatural)** | **"Day and night for ever and ever"** |

**Destruction vocabulary (G622/G684/G3639):**

| Passage | Vocabulary | Subject | Context |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Jhn 3:15-16 | G622 (apollumi) | Unbelievers generally | Vs. eternal life |
| Mat 10:28 | G622 (apollumi) | Human sinners in gehenna | "Destroy both soul and body" |
| Mat 7:13 | G684 (apoleia) | Human sinners generally | "Way that leadeth to destruction" |
| Phil 3:19 | G684 (apoleia) | Enemies of the cross | "End is destruction" |
| 2 Thess 1:9 | G3639 (olethros) + G166 | Human sinners (general) | "Everlasting destruction" |
| 2 Pet 2:12 | G622 (apollumi) + G5356 | False teachers | "Shall utterly perish in their own corruption" |
| Rev 17:8,11 | G684 (apoleia) | The beast | "Go into perdition" |

**Summary table: vocabulary distribution by subject type:**

| Subject Type | Primary Vocabulary Used | Examples |
|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| Supernatural beings (devil, beast, false prophet) | Torment (G928, Rev 20:10) | Rev 20:10 |
| Named supernatural beings + specific human groups | Torment (G928/G929) | Rev 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers); Rev 9:5 (bounded) |
| Human beings generally (NT epistles) | Destruction (G622, G684, G3639) | 2 Thess 1:9; Phil 3:19; Jhn 3:16 |
| Human beings (judgment parables) | Fire (G4442) + weeping/gnashing (G2805/G1030) | Mat 13:42,50; 25:41 |
| Human beings (Revelation) | Second death (thanatos, G2288) | Rev 20:14-15; 21:8 |

**Established item N033:** "basanizō/basanismos lexically distinct from destruction vocabulary — no NT text uses BOTH for the same subject." This is an observable distributional fact: no single NT passage uses both torment vocabulary (G928/G929) AND destruction vocabulary (G622/G684/G3639) for the same person/group in the same context.

## 6. Additional Words Relevant to Subject Differentiation

### G126 — ἀΐδιος (aidios) — Everlasting (Jude 1:6)

- BLB count: 2 NT occurrences (Jude 1:6; Romans 1:20)
- Definition: eternal, everlasting — emphasizing perpetual continuity
- Different from G166 (aiōnios) — aidios stresses the unending character of duration
- In Jude 1:6: "everlasting [aidios] chains" for rebellious angels — the chains are permanently/perpetually binding UNTO the judgment day (not after it; the judgment day is the terminus)
- Not used in Rev 20:10 or Mat 25:41,46 — those passages use G166 (aiōnios)

### G2673 — καταργέω (katargeō) — Destroy/Render Inoperative (Heb 2:14)

- BLB count: 27 NT occurrences
- Definition: to render inoperative, abolish, bring to nothing, put an end to
- In Heb 2:14: Christ's death is purposive — ἵνα... καταργήσῃ τὸν... διάβολον — "that he might render inoperative/destroy the devil"
- The destruction is of the devil's POWER (κράτος = power/dominion over death), not necessarily the devil's conscious existence
- This is the NT's fullest statement about what happens TO the devil through redemption — but the mechanism of ultimate destruction is not specified here

### G5020 — ταρταρόω (tartaroō) — Cast to Tartarus (2 Pet 2:4)

- BLB count: 1 NT occurrence (hapax legomenon)
- Definition: to cast down to Tartarus (the deepest abyss in Greek cosmology)
- In 2 Pet 2:4: describes God's confinement of sinning angels — temporary holding UNTO judgment
- Neither torment nor destruction vocabulary — confinement language

### G2198 — ζάω (zaō) — To Live (Rev 19:20)

- BLB count: 143 NT occurrences
- Key occurrence: Rev 19:20 — ζῶντες (Pres Act Ptcp Nom Pl M) = "living/while alive"
- Beast and false prophet cast in ALIVE — implies a state of conscious existence at the moment of being cast in
- Whether they remain alive/conscious throughout the "for ever and ever" torment is addressed by Rev 20:10's "tormented" formula applied to them
