## Revelation 20:10 — The Central Verse

**Greek Text:**
καὶ ὁ διάβολος ὁ πλανῶν αὐτοὺς ἐβλήθη εἰς τὴν λίμνην τοῦ πυρὸς καὶ θείου, ὅπου καὶ τὸ θηρίον καὶ ὁ ψευδοπροφήτης, καὶ βασανισθήσονται ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων.

**KJV:** "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."

| τῶν | ὁ | G3588 | T-GPM (Gen Pl M) |
| αἰώνων | αἰών | G165 | **N-GPM (Gen Pl M)** — "of the ages" |

**Critical parsing notes:**
1. **βασανισθήσονται** (G928) = Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural of basanizō — "they shall be tormented." The subject is grammatically the three named entities: ὁ διάβολος (devil), τὸ θηρίον (beast), ὁ ψευδοπροφήτης (false prophet). All three are nominative-case subjects.
2. The verb is **FUTURE PASSIVE** — the torment is something that will be inflicted upon them, ongoing from the time of casting.
3. **εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων** = "into the ages of the ages" — the same formula appearing in Rev 14:11; 19:3; and 11 other Revelation doxology/worship contexts.
4. **ἐβλήθη** (Aorist Passive 3rd Singular) — the devil's being cast is a single completed action. The subsequent torment (βασανισθήσονται, Future) is an ongoing state.
5. The three subjects in the nominative: ὁ διάβολος, τὸ θηρίον, ὁ ψευδοπροφήτης — none of these are human beings. Beast and false prophet were already in the lake (ὅπου = "where") from Rev 19:20.

## Revelation 20:14 — Death and Hades = Second Death

**Greek Text:**
καὶ ὁ θάνατος καὶ ὁ Ἅιδης ἐβλήθησαν εἰς τὴν λίμνην τοῦ πυρός. οὗτος ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός ἐστιν, ἡ λίμνη τοῦ πυρός.

**KJV:** "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| ὁ θάνατος | θάνατος | G2288 | N-NSM — "death" |
| ὁ Ἅιδης | ᾅδης | G86 | N-NSM — "hades" |
| ἐβλήθησαν | βάλλω | G906 | V-API-3P (Aor Pass Ind Pl thirdPers) — "were cast" |
| λίμνην | λίμνη | G3041 | N-ASF — "lake" |
| οὗτος | οὗτος | G3778 | D-NSM — "this" |
| ὁ θάνατος | θάνατος | G2288 | N-NSM — "death" |
| ὁ δεύτερός | δεύτερος | G1208 | A-NSM — "the second" |
| ἐστιν | εἰμί | G1510 | V-PAI-3S (Pres Act Ind 3S) — "is" |
| ἡ λίμνη | λίμνη | G3041 | N-NSF — "the lake" |

**Critical parsing notes:**
1. "This is the second death" (οὗτος ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός ἐστιν, ἡ λίμνη τοῦ πυρός) — the equative sentence identifies the lake of fire AS the second death. The copula ἐστιν makes this an identity statement.
2. **No torment vocabulary** (G928/G929) appears in v.14. Death and hades are "cast in" (same verb as human wicked in v.15 and as the devil in v.10), but no "tormented for ever and ever" follows.
3. G1208 (deuteros) = "second" — this is a qualitative marker, identifying this death as distinct in kind from the first (biological) death.

## Revelation 20:15 — Human Wicked Cast In

**Greek Text:**
καὶ εἴ τις οὐχ εὑρέθη ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ τῆς ζωῆς γεγραμμένος, ἐβλήθη εἰς τὴν λίμνην τοῦ πυρός.

**KJV:** "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| τις | τὶς | G5100 | X-NSM — "anyone" |
| οὐχ εὑρέθη | εὑρίσκω | G2147 | V-API-3S (Aor Pass Ind 3S) — "was not found" |
| βίβλῳ | βίβλος | G976 | N-DSF — "in the book" |
| ζωῆς | ζωή | G2222 | N-GSF — "of life" |
| γεγραμμένος | γράφω | G1125 | V-RPP-NSM (Perf Pass Ptcp Nom Sg M) — "having been written" |
| ἐβλήθη | βάλλω | G906 | V-API-3S (Aor Pass Ind 3S) — "was cast" |
| λίμνην | λίμνη | G3041 | N-ASF — "lake" |

**Critical parsing notes:**
1. **No G928/G929 torment vocabulary** in v.15. The human wicked are described as "cast into" the lake — the same aorist passive of βάλλω used in v.10 (for the devil) and v.14 (for death and hades) — but no subsequent "tormented day and night for ever and ever" is appended to v.15.
2. The contrast between v.10 (names three entities + "tormented for ever") and v.15 (generic category "anyone" + simply "cast in" with no torment-formula) is a textual fact.
3. γεγραμμένος = Perfect Passive Participle = "having been written" (permanent, settled state of not being in the book of life).

## Revelation 21:8 — Second Death for Human Wicked

**Greek Text:**
τοῖς δὲ δειλοῖς καὶ ἀπίστοις καὶ ἐβδελυγμένοις καὶ φονεῦσιν καὶ πόρνοις καὶ φαρμάκοις καὶ εἰδωλολάτραις καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς ψευδέσιν τὸ μέρος αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ λίμνῃ τῇ καιομένῃ πυρὶ καὶ θείῳ, ὅ ἐστιν ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος.

**KJV:** "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."

| Key Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| λίμνῃ | λίμνη | G3041 | N-DSF — "lake" |
| καιομένῃ | καίω | G2545 | V-PPP-DSF (Pres Pass Ptcp Dat Sg F) — "burning" |
| ὅ ἐστιν | εἰμί | G1510 | V-PAI-3S — "which is" |
| ὁ θάνατος | θάνατος | G2288 | N-NSM — "death" |
| ὁ δεύτερος | δεύτερος | G1208 | A-NSM — "second" |

**Critical parsing notes:**
1. The lake is identified as ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος ("the second death") — same identification as Rev 20:14.
2. Eight categories of human sinners (fearful, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, whoremongers, sorcerers, idolaters, liars) — all human categories, not supernatural entities.
3. **No G928/G929 torment vocabulary.** The outcome for these humans is described as "the second death," not "tormented day and night for ever and ever."
4. τὸ μέρος αὐτῶν (N-NSN = "their part/portion") — share/allotment language, not ongoing-experience language.

## Revelation 19:20 — Beast and False Prophet Cast Alive

**Greek Text:**
καὶ ἐπιάσθη τὸ θηρίον καὶ μετ' αὐτοῦ ὁ ψευδοπροφήτης ὁ ποιήσας τὰ σημεῖα ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, ἐν οἷς ἐπλάνησεν τοὺς λαβόντας τὸ χάραγμα τοῦ θηρίου καὶ τοὺς προσκυνοῦντας τῇ εἰκόνι αὐτοῦ· ζῶντες ἐβλήθησαν οἱ δύο εἰς τὴν λίμνην τοῦ πυρὸς τῆς καιομένης ἐν θείῳ.

**KJV:** "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him... These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."

| Key Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| ἐπιάσθη | πιάζω | G4084 | V-API-3S (Aor Pass Ind 3S) — "was seized/captured" |
| θηρίον | θηρίον | G2342 | N-NSN — "the beast" |
| ψευδοπροφήτης | ψευδοπροφήτης | G5578 | N-NSM — "the false prophet" |
| **ζῶντες** | **ζάω** | **G2198** | **V-PAP-NPM (Pres Act Ptcp Nom Pl M)** — **"living/alive"** |
| ἐβλήθησαν | βάλλω | G906 | V-API-3P (Aor Pass Ind Pl 3P) — "were cast" |
| λίμνην | λίμνη | G3041 | N-ASF — "lake" |

**Critical parsing notes:**
1. **ζῶντες** (G2198, Present Active Participle, Nominative Plural Masculine) = "being alive / while living" — both beast and false prophet are cast in while alive. This contrasts with "the remnant" in v.21 who are "slain with the sword."
2. This establishes the beast and false prophet as already in the lake at Rev 20:10. In Rev 20:10 the devil is cast "where the beast and the false prophet [are]" (ὅπου = "where" + present implied state).
3. No torment formula in Rev 19:20 itself — the "tormented day and night for ever and ever" does not appear until Rev 20:10 when the devil joins them.

## Matthew 25:41 — Everlasting Fire for Devil and His Angels

**Greek Text:**
τότε ἐρεῖ καὶ τοῖς ἐξ εὐωνύμων Πορεύεσθε ἀπ' ἐμοῦ κατηραμένοι εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ αἰώνιον τὸ ἡτοιμασμένον τῷ διαβόλῳ καὶ τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ.

**KJV:** "Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."

| Key Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| ἐρεῖ | εἶπον | G2046 | V-FAI-3S (Fut Act Ind 3S) — "he will say" |
| πῦρ | πῦρ | G4442 | N-ASN — "fire" |
| αἰώνιον | αἰώνιος | G166 | **A-ASN (Acc Sg N)** — "everlasting" (modifies πῦρ) |
| ἡτοιμασμένον | ἑτοιμάζω | G2090 | **V-RPP-ASN (Perf Pass Ptcp Acc Sg N)** — "having been prepared" |
| τῷ διαβόλῳ | διάβολος | G1228 | **A-DSM (Dat Sg M)** — "for the devil" (DATIVE of purpose/intended recipient) |
| τοῖς ἀγγέλοις | ἄγγελος | G32 | **N-DPM (Dat Pl M)** — "for his angels" (DATIVE) |

**Critical parsing notes:**
1. **τῷ διαβόλῳ** (G1228) and **τοῖς ἀγγέλοις** (G32) are both in the DATIVE case. The fire was prepared FOR (dative = purpose/indirect object) the devil and his angels — not primarily for human beings.
2. **ἡτοιμασμένον** = Perfect Passive Participle — the fire was already prepared (past completed action, present state). Its primary intended recipients are identified as supernatural.
3. **αἰώνιον** modifying πῦρ = "everlasting fire." Same adjective G166 as in Mat 25:46 for the punishment. Different noun: here it is the fire that is everlasting; in v.46 it is the punishment (kolasis) that is everlasting.
4. No "torment" vocabulary (G928/G929) in this verse. The mechanism is described as fire, not explicitly as torment. Human beings are said to "depart into" the fire (v.41), not said to be "tormented."

## Matthew 25:46 — Everlasting Punishment vs. Eternal Life

**Greek Text:**
καὶ ἀπελεύσονται οὗτοι εἰς κόλασιν αἰώνιον, οἱ δὲ δίκαιοι εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον.

**KJV:** "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| ἀπελεύσονται | ἀπέρχομαι | G565 | V-FDI-3P (Fut Mid Ind Pl 3P) — "they will go away" |
| οὗτοι | οὗτος | G3778 | D-NPM — "these" (= the goats, the condemned humans) |
| κόλασιν | κόλασις | G2851 | **N-ASF (Acc Sg F)** — "punishment" |
| αἰώνιον | αἰώνιος | G166 | **A-ASF (Acc Sg F)** — "everlasting" (modifies κόλασιν) |
| οἱ δίκαιοι | δίκαιος | G1342 | A-NPM — "the righteous" |
| ζωὴν | ζωή | G2222 | N-ASF — "life" |
| αἰώνιον | αἰώνιος | G166 | **A-ASF (Acc Sg F)** — "eternal" (modifies ζωὴν) |

**Critical parsing notes:**
1. **κόλασιν αἰώνιον** (G2851 + G166): The noun is G2851 (kolasis = penal infliction/punishment), NOT G929 (basanismos = torment). Kolasis designates the punitive category, not the mechanism.
2. Both αἰώνιον instances are **identically parsed: A-ASF (Accusative Singular Feminine)**. The grammatical symmetry is complete — "everlasting punishment" and "life eternal" use the same grammatical form.
3. **ἀπελεύσονται** = Future Middle Indicative — "they will go away" — implies movement/departure to a destination, not ongoing conscious torment described in this verse.
4. The contrast is **kolasis aionion** (everlasting punishment) vs. **zōēn aionion** (eternal life). The punishment is characterized as aionion (everlasting/pertaining to the age), but the noun choice (kolasis not basanismos) leaves the mechanism unspecified as either ECT or conditionalist in this verse alone.

## Jude 1:6 — Aidios Chains for Rebellious Angels

**Greek Text:**
ἀγγέλους τε τοὺς μὴ τηρήσαντας τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἀρχὴν ἀλλὰ ἀπολιπόντας τὸ ἴδιον οἰκητήριον εἰς κρίσιν μεγάλης ἡμέρας δεσμοῖς ἀϊδίοις ὑπὸ ζόφον τετήρηκεν·

**KJV:** "And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."

| Key Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| ἀγγέλους | ἄγγελος | G32 | N-APM — "angels" |
| τηρήσαντας | τηρέω | G5083 | V-AAP-APM (Aor Act Ptcp Acc Pl M) — "having kept" |
| ἀπολιπόντας | ἀπολείπω | G620 | V-2AAP-APM — "having abandoned" |
| ἀρχὴν | ἀρχή | G746 | N-ASF — "first estate/beginning/dominion" |
| κρίσιν | κρίσις | G2920 | N-ASF — "unto judgment" |
| δεσμοῖς | δεσμός | G1199 | N-DPM — "in chains" |
| **ἀϊδίοις** | **ἀΐδιος** | **G126** | **A-DPM — "everlasting" (aidios)** |
| ζόφον | ζόφος | G2217 | N-ASM — "darkness/gloom" |
| τετήρηκεν | τηρέω | G5083 | V-RAI-3S (Perf Act Ind 3S) — "he has reserved/kept" |

**Critical parsing notes:**
1. **ἀϊδίοις** (G126, aidios) = a DIFFERENT Greek word for "everlasting/eternal" than G166 (aiōnios). G126 appears only 2x in NT (Jude 1:6; Romans 1:20). It emphasizes perpetual continuity.
2. The angels are held in **chains of darkness** (δεσμοῖς ὑπὸ ζόφον) **unto the judgment** (εἰς κρίσιν) — their confinement is temporary, a holding state until judgment. This contrasts with the final state in Rev 20:10.
3. **τετήρηκεν** (Perfect Active Indicative) = "has reserved and keeps reserved" — ongoing present result of past action.
4. The subject is **supernatural entities** (rebellious angels), not human beings. Language of confinement/chains for pre-judgment state.

## Hebrews 2:14 — Destroy the Devil (Katargeō)

**Greek Text:**
ἐπεὶ οὖν τὰ παιδία κεκοινώνηκεν αἵματος καὶ σαρκός, καὶ αὐτὸς παραπλησίως μετέσχεν τῶν αὐτῶν, ἵνα διὰ τοῦ θανάτου καταργήσῃ τὸν τὸ κράτος ἔχοντα τοῦ θανάτου, τοῦτ' ἔστιν τὸν διάβολον,

**KJV:** "...that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil."

| Key Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| **καταργήσῃ** | **καταργέω** | **G2673** | **V-AAS-3S (Aor Act Subj 3S)** — "might destroy/render inoperative" |
| τὸν κράτος ἔχοντα | ἔχω | G2192 | V-PAP-ASM (Pres Act Ptcp Acc Sg M) — "the one having power" |
| θανάτου | θάνατος | G2288 | N-GSM — "of death" |
| τὸν διάβολον | διάβολος | G1228 | A-ASM — "the devil" (accusative object) |

**Critical parsing notes:**
1. **καταργήσῃ** (G2673) = NOT G622 (apollumi) but KATARGEŌ = to render inoperative, abolish, bring to nothing, destroy. The Aorist Subjunctive indicates purpose (ἵνα = "in order that").
2. G2673 (katargeō) appears 27x in NT, often meaning "render inoperative/idle/ineffective" (Romans 3:3, 31; 6:6; 1 Cor 15:24, 26). The destruction of the devil through Christ's death targets his POWER over death.
3. This text is ECT-compatible (devil rendered powerless / destroyed as a power) and conditionalist-compatible (devil ultimately destroyed/annihilated). The verb does not specify mechanism.
4. The devil is the direct object (accusative: τὸν διάβολον). The purpose of Christ's incarnation and death includes rendering the devil's power inoperative.
