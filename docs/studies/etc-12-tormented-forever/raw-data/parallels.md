| Proverbia 16:27 | 0.327 | 0.60 | 0.10 | 0.00 | burn |

**Note:** Isaiah 34:10 scores with theological phrase matching [continual,forever] — the OT source for the "smoke for ever" formula (IB009, resolved Strong toward literary-formula/desolation in etc5-11). This is the highest theological-phrase match among OT parallels for Rev 20:10.

- Rev 14:11 scores second (0.498) with theological phrase matching [continual,forever] — the smoke-for-ever formula also studied in etc5-11

| MAT 18:9 | 0.316 | 0.38 | 0.40 | 0.00 | alive, burn, cast, into |

**Key observations:** Rev 13:8 and 17:8 (book of life) are the strongest semantic parallels for the book-of-life motif. John 15:6 parallels the "cast into fire" for non-abiders in Christ.

---

## Rev 21:8 — OT Parallels

Top matches primarily on "burn" and "death" terms — no strong theological-phrase matches. Highest scores around 0.331 (Deut 17:7, Psa 106:18). No OT parallel scores above 0.340.

| JHN 8:44 | 0.319 | 0.49 | 0.20 | 0.00 | liar, murderer |

**Key observation:** Rev 22:15 (idolater, immoral, murderer, sorcerer) parallels the same sin-categories as Rev 21:8 — both are human wicked categories.

---

## Mat 25:41 — OT Parallels

Top matches primarily on "burn" and "age" — no strong theological-phrase matches. Highest scores around 0.373 (2 Chr 33:6 "burn"). Isa 33:14 scores 0.348 ("age, burn").

**Isa 33:14 text:** "The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?" — this is a notable OT parallel for the concept of everlasting fire.

## Mat 25:41 — NT Parallels

| Reference | Hybrid | Sem | Key | Theo | Key Terms |

| REV 14:10 | 0.418 | 0.72 | 0.20 | 0.00 | angel, burn |

| LUK 2:15 | 0.371 | 0.56 | 0.30 | 0.00 | angel, depart, into |

**Key observation:** Rev 20:10 ranks third among NT parallels for Mat 25:41 (0.414) — the shared elements (age, burn, devil, into) confirm the lexical connection between the "everlasting fire prepared for the devil" and the lake of fire where the devil is tormented.

---

## Mat 25:46 — OT Parallels

Top matches on "age" and "alive" terms. Ezek 18:21 (0.391, "alive"), Psa 119:93 (0.391, "age, alive"). No theological-phrase matches for "everlasting punishment."

Daniel 12:2 is NOT in the top 20 by hybrid score but is relevant: "some shall awake to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" — the nearest OT parallel to Mat 25:46's double-outcome structure.

## Mat 25:46 — NT Parallels

| GAL 6:8 | 0.365 | 0.61 | 0.20 | 0.00 | age, alive |

**Key observation:** 2 Thess 1:9 ("everlasting destruction") appears among the top NT parallels for Mat 25:46 (0.380) — both use G166 (aionios) in judgment contexts.

---

## Heb 2:14 — OT Parallels

Top matches primarily on "blood," "flesh," "children," "death." No theological-phrase matches. Highest = Jer 18:21 (0.365, "children, death, therefore").

**Key observation:** 1 John 3:8 ("the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy [lysē] the works of the devil") parallels Heb 2:14 — both describe Christ's mission as targeting/destroying the devil. Different verb (G3089 lyō = loosen/destroy vs G2673 katargeō = render inoperative).

---

## Rev 19:20 — OT Parallels

Top matches primarily on "burn" and "prophet." No strong theological-phrase matches. Highest = Deut 13:6 (0.348, "burn, prophet").

| REV 12:9 | 0.347 | 0.62 | 0.10 | 0.00 | deceiv |

**Key observation:** Rev 20:10 is the strongest NT parallel for Rev 19:20 (0.641, reciprocally confirmed) — the two highest-scoring cross-references in this study mutually reinforce each other. Rev 14:11 is the fourth-strongest parallel for Rev 19:20, confirming the thematic cluster: beast-mark worshippers (14:11), beast and false prophet (19:20), devil/beast/false prophet (20:10).
