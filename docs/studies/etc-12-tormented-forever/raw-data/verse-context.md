### Revelation 19:1-3 — Babylon's Smoke for Ever (Context for Rev 20:10 formula)

> **Rev 19:1** And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
>
> **Rev 19:2** For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
>
> **Rev 19:3** And again they said, Alleluia. And **her smoke rose up for ever and ever**.

*Note: Rev 19:3 uses the identical εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων formula for Babylon's completed destruction. Established as E250/IB009 Strong toward literary-formula/desolation reading in etc5-11.*

### Revelation 19:17-21 — Beast and False Prophet Cast Alive

> **Rev 19:17** And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
>
> **Rev 19:18** That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all [men, both] free and bond, both small and great.
>
> **Rev 19:19** And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
>
> **Rev 19:20** And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. **These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.**
>
> **Rev 19:21** And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which [sword] proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.

*Note: Rev 19:20 — the beast and false prophet are cast ALIVE (ζῶντες, Present Active Participle) while the human remnant in v.21 are "slain with the sword." Two different outcomes: alive into the lake (beast/false prophet) vs. slain (human armies).*

> **25:31** When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

>

>
> **13:38** The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];
>
> **13:39** The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

### "Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth" Passages

*Wailing/gnashing pattern analysis:*
- **"Outer darkness"** (Mat 8:12; 22:13; 25:30) — excludes from light/kingdom; darkness ≠ fire
- **"Furnace of fire"** (Mat 13:42, 50) — fire imagery with wailing/gnashing
- **"Cut asunder"** (Mat 24:51) — violent separation; "portion with the hypocrites"
- **"Thrust out"** (Luk 13:28) — exclusion language; moment of realization
- All passages describe the response (wailing/gnashing) — not the ongoing content of an eternal state
- Three contexts use DARKNESS; two use FIRE — these are not obviously compatible descriptions of the same ongoing state

### Supernatural Being Judgment Passages

**Jude 1:4-9:**
> **1:4** For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
>
> **1:5** I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward **destroyed them that believed not**.
>
> **1:6** And **the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day**.
>
> **1:7** Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, **suffering the vengeance of eternal fire**.
>
> **1:8** Likewise also these [filthy] dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
>
> **1:9** Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

*Note: Jude 1:6 — angels confined in "everlasting [aidios, G126] chains" UNTIL the judgment of the great day. This is a pre-final-state holding status. Jude 1:7 — Sodom set forth as an example "suffering the vengeance of eternal fire" — but established IB009-resolved (formerly N029, reclassified N→I-B; Sodom reduced to ashes, 2 Pet 2:6) shows "eternal fire" there = completed destruction.*

**2 Peter 2:4-9:**
> **2:4** For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but **cast [them] down to hell [tartaroo], and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment**;
>
> **2:5** And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person], a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
>
> **2:6** And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
>
> **2:7** And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:
>
> **2:8** (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds;)
>
> **2:9** The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:

*Note: 2 Pet 2:4 — "tartaroo" (G5020, unique NT word, hapax legomenon) = casting down to the lowest regions; angels held in chains UNTO judgment. Same temporary-confinement pattern as Jude 1:6. The Sodom parallel (v.6) is "ashes" — conditionalist.*

**Hebrews 2:14:**
> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that **through death he might destroy [katargeō] him that had the power of death, that is, the devil**;

**1 Corinthians 6:3:**
> Know ye not that **we shall judge angels**? how much more things that pertain to this life?

### Conditionalist Contrast Passages

**John 3:14-16:**
> **3:14** And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
>
> **3:15** That whosoever believeth in him should not **perish [apollumi]**, but have eternal life.
>
> **3:16** For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not **perish [apollumi]**, but have everlasting life.

**Matthew 10:26-28:**
> **10:26** Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
>
> **10:27** What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, [that] preach ye upon the housetops.
>
> **10:28** And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is **able to destroy [apollumi] both soul and body in hell [gehenna]**.

**2 Thessalonians 1:5-9:**
> **1:5** [Which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
>
> **1:6** Seeing [it is] a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
>
> **1:7** And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
>
> **1:8** In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
>
> **1:9** Who shall be punished with **everlasting destruction [olethron aionion] from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power**;

**Philippians 3:17-19:**
> **3:17** Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
>
> **3:18** (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:
>
> **3:19** Whose **end [is] destruction [apoleia]**, whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

**Matthew 7:13-14:**
> **7:13** Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide [is] the gate, and broad [is] the way, that leadeth to **destruction [apoleia]**, and many there be which go in thereat:
>
> **7:14** Because strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
