# Raw Concept Context Data

## REV 20:10
```
No theological concepts found in REV 20:10
```
Note: The concept_context tool found no mapped theological concepts in Rev 20:10. This is because the verse's key terms (devil, beast, false prophet, lake, fire, torment) are not among the standard theological concept categories tracked by the tool (which focuses on concepts like DEATH, FAITH, RIGHTEOUSNESS, etc.).

## REV 20:14

### Concepts Found
- **DEATH:** Maveth/thanatos - death, dying (Strong's: G2288, G86, G2288)

### Same Chapter (Revelation 20) -- 2 verses
1. **Rev 20:13** -- "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works." [DEATH]
2. **Rev 20:6** -- "Blessed and holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power..." [DEATH]

### Same Book (Revelation) -- 17 verses (selected)
1. **Rev 1:18** -- "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death." [DEATH]
2. **Rev 2:10** -- "...be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." [DEATH]
3. **Rev 2:11** -- "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death." [DEATH]
4. **Rev 2:23** -- "And I will kill her children with death..." [DEATH]
5. **Rev 12:11** -- "...they loved not their lives unto the death." [DEATH]
6. **Rev 14:13** -- "Blessed [are] the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth..." [DEATH]
7. **Rev 16:3** -- "...and every living soul died in the sea." [DEATH]

9. **Rev 21:4** -- "...there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain..." [DEATH]

### Other Books -- 967 verses (DEATH is an extremely common concept)
The tool found 967 verses across the rest of Scripture with the DEATH concept. This demonstrates that "death" is a major biblical concept with extensive coverage.

**Key observation:** The concept_context tool identifies Rev 20:14 as fundamentally a verse about DEATH. The "second death" connects to the broader biblical death/life contrast. The most relevant same-book connections are:
- Rev 20:6 (second death has no power over the first resurrection)
- Rev 20:13 (death and hades deliver up the dead)
- Rev 2:11 (overcomers not hurt by second death)
- Rev 21:4 (no more death in new creation)

## MAT 25:41

### Concepts Found
- **CURSE:** Qalal/katara - curse, make light of (Strong's: G2672)

### Same Book (Matthew) -- 1 verse
1. **Matt 5:44** -- "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you..." [CURSE]

### Other Books -- 193 verses
The tool found 193 verses with the CURSE concept across Scripture.

**Key observation:** The concept_context tool identifies Matt 25:41 primarily through the "ye cursed" vocabulary. The theological concept detected is CURSE, not FIRE or PUNISHMENT. The verse's connection to the judgment/fire theme is not captured through the concept mapping, but the text itself provides the connection: "everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."
