# Tormented Forever (Rev 20:10) — Plain-Language Summary

## What This Study Is About

Revelation 20:10 contains the phrase "tormented day and night for ever and ever." This is one of the most powerful verses cited in support of the view that the unsaved will consciously suffer without end in the lake of fire (eternal conscious torment, or ECT). This study asks a basic but critical question: *Who does the text actually say is tormented? And what does it say about the fate of human beings in the same passage?*

## What the Text Actually Says

**Revelation 20:10** — "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."

The verse names three subjects: the devil, the beast, and the false prophet. None of these is a human being.

- The **devil** is a non-human supernatural spirit being. Revelation 12:9 identifies him as "the dragon, that old serpent... Satan."
- The **beast** is a symbolic apocalyptic figure — it rises from the sea, has seven heads and ten horns, is identified by a number, and is described as one who "was, and is not" (Rev 13:1; 17:8). This is not a description of a literal human being.
- The **false prophet** is the second beast of Revelation 13:11-17, also a symbolic apocalyptic entity.

Furthermore, the entire book of Revelation communicates through signs and visions. Revelation 1:1 says the book was "signified" (Greek: *semaino* — sent through signs) to John. This is the genre of apocalyptic vision, not plain didactic teaching.

## What the Same Passage Says About Human Beings

The passage does not stop at verse 10. In the very same context (Revelation 20:7-15), the text uses *different words* when describing the fate of human beings:

- **Rev 20:9** — "And fire came down from God out of heaven, and **devoured** them." (The human armies of Gog and Magog are *devoured* — a destruction word, not a torment word.)
- **Rev 20:14-15** — "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. **This is the second death.** And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." (Human beings — **death** vocabulary, no torment formula attached.)
- **Rev 21:8** — "But the fearful, and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: **which is the second death.**" (Eight categories of human wicked — again the text calls it death, not torment.)

Notice what is absent: when humans enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:15; 21:8), the text never says they are "tormented day and night for ever and ever." It calls their fate "the second death." The author had every opportunity to apply the torment formula to humans and chose not to.

The same distinction appears in Revelation 19:20-21: the beast and false prophet are cast "alive" (*zontes*) into the lake of fire — they continue. But the human remnant were "slain" (*apektanthesan*) — they die.

## The Greek Word "Tormented" (Basanizo) — What It Does and Does Not Mean

The Greek word translated "tormented" in Revelation 20:10 is *basanizo* (G928). It appears 12 times in the New Testament, and most of its uses have nothing to do with eschatological punishment:

- Physical illness — "my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, **grievously tormented**" (Matt 8:6)
- Waves tossing a boat — "the ship was now in the midst of the sea, **tossed** with waves" (Matt 14:24)
- Toiling at rowing — "he saw them **toiling** in rowing" (Mark 6:48)
- Emotional distress — Lot was "**vexed** with the filthy conversation of the wicked" (2 Pet 2:8)
- Labor pains — "she being with child cried, **travailing** in birth" (Rev 12:2)

Seven of the twelve occurrences are non-judgment contexts. The word simply means pain, toil, or distress — it is not a technical term for eternal punishment.

All five uses of *basanizo* in a judgment context appear either in Revelation's apocalyptic visions or in the mouths of *demons* speaking about their own future (Matt 8:29: "Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?"). Not a single epistle, not a single Gospel, and no Old Testament passage uses this word for the final fate of ordinary human beings.

Scripture also uses the related noun *basanismos* six times — all in Revelation. Three of those six describe the *completed destruction* of Babylon: "utterly burned with fire" (18:8), destroyed "in one hour" (18:10), "thrown down, and shall be found no more at all" (18:21). Clearly, "torment" language in Revelation can describe total destruction, not perpetual suffering.

One additional use of *basanizo* carries an explicit **five-month time limit** (Rev 9:5), which confirms the word does not inherently mean "eternal."

## What the Rest of the New Testament Says About Human Judgment

Outside Revelation, the New Testament consistently uses destruction and death vocabulary when describing the final fate of human beings who are lost:

- "Fear him which is able to **destroy** both soul and body in hell" (Matt 10:28)
- "God so loved the world, that... whosoever believeth in him should not **perish**" (John 3:16)
- "The wages of sin is **death**" (Rom 6:23)
- "Who shall be punished with **everlasting destruction**" (2 Thess 1:9)
- "Whose end is **destruction**" (Phil 3:19)
- "The ungodly... reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and **perdition**" (2 Pet 3:7)
- "He that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap **corruption**" (Gal 6:8)
- "A certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall **devour** the adversaries" (Heb 10:27)

This vocabulary — destroy, perish, death, destruction, perdition, corruption, devour — appears across multiple authors, across epistles and Gospels, and is the Bible's consistent language for human judgment. None of these passages uses *basanizo* or torment vocabulary.

Additionally, Matthew 25:41 says the everlasting fire was "prepared for the **devil and his angels**" — not originally for human beings. And the punishment word used for humans in Matthew 25:46 is *kolasis* (punishment), not *basanizo* (torment).

## The Central Question: Does "Same Place" Mean "Same Experience"?

The main argument for extending Revelation 20:10 to all humans is straightforward: the same lake of fire that receives the devil, beast, and false prophet (v.10) also receives human beings (v.15). If they're in the same place, won't they experience the same thing?

The problem is that the text itself answers this question by using *different words* for different subjects at the same destination. The author describes:

- The three non-human/symbolic entities: **tormented**
- The human armies: **devoured**
- Human wicked entering the lake: **second death**

The text does not say all inhabitants of the lake share identical experiences. It says the opposite, by choosing different vocabulary for each group. To conclude that humans are "tormented day and night for ever and ever" requires going beyond what the text states and overriding the text's own word for the human experience of the lake — "the second death."

## What Can Fairly Be Said, and What Cannot

**Scripture does say:**

- The devil, the beast, and the false prophet are tormented in the lake of fire for ever and ever (Rev 20:10).
- Human beings who enter the lake of fire face "the second death" (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8).
- Human enemies of God are "devoured" by fire (Rev 20:9).
- The "tormented for ever and ever" formula appears exactly once in all of Scripture — in Revelation 20:10 — applied to these three non-human or symbolic entities.
- Outside Revelation, the New Testament consistently uses death and destruction language for the fate of human beings.

**Scripture does not say:**

- That human beings are "tormented day and night for ever and ever" — the formula is never applied to humans anywhere in the Bible.
- That *basanizo* is a technical term for eternal conscious punishment — the word covers illness, waves, labor pains, and rowing, and one judgment use has a five-month limit.
- That everyone in the lake of fire shares the same experience as the devil, beast, and false prophet — the text itself uses different vocabulary for different subjects.

## Conclusion

Revelation 20:10 is a powerful verse, but its three named subjects — the devil, the beast, and the false prophet — are not human beings. The "tormented day and night for ever and ever" formula is applied to these three entities in an apocalyptic vision. When the same passage describes the fate of human beings, it uses "devoured" (v.9) and "the second death" (vv.14-15; 21:8). The torment formula is never applied to humans in this passage, or anywhere else in Scripture.

The broader New Testament, written in plain didactic language across epistles and Gospels, consistently uses destruction and death vocabulary for human judgment: destroy, perish, death, destruction, perdition, corruption. This is the Bible's own vocabulary for human fate.

Extending the "tormented for ever and ever" formula from three non-human or symbolic entities to all lost human beings is an inference — and one that the text's own vocabulary does not support. The conditionalist reading (that human beings face destruction and death, not eternal conscious torment) is what the text of Revelation 20:7-15 and the wider New Testament explicitly state.
