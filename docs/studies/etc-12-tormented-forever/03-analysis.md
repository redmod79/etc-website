# Verse Analysis: Tormented Forever (Rev 20:10)

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Revelation 20:1-3 (Dragon/Devil/Satan Bound)
**Context:** John's apocalyptic vision. An angel binds "the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan" for a thousand years.
**Direct statement:** The text provides a fourfold identification chain: dragon = old serpent = Devil = Satan. This identifies the devil as the dragon of Rev 12, a non-human supernatural entity depicted through apocalyptic imagery.
**Key observations:** All four designations (dragon, old serpent, Devil, Satan) are accumulated to make identification unambiguous. The "great chain" and "bottomless pit" are visionary elements -- a spiritual being is restrained through apocalyptic symbolism.
**Cross-references:** Rev 12:9 provides the same identification chain. The dragon is the power behind the beast (Rev 13:2,4). The devil is consistently a non-human entity throughout both testaments.

### Revelation 20:4-6 (First Resurrection -- Context)
**Context:** John sees thrones and those who "had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark." They "lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."
**Direct statement:** The "second death" has no power over those in the first resurrection (v.6). The phrase "second death" is introduced as a category before it is defined in v.14.
**Key observations:** The term "second death" appears here as something the blessed are exempt from. This establishes the term before its full identification in v.14 and 21:8.

### Revelation 20:7-8 (Satan Loosed, Gog and Magog)
**Context:** Satan is loosed and deceives nations (Gog and Magog) -- human armies -- to gather against the saints.
**Direct statement:** The deceived nations are human armies, "the number of whom is as the sand of the sea."
**Key observations:** The text distinguishes between Satan (the deceiver, a supernatural entity) and the nations (the deceived, human beings). This subject distinction becomes critical in verses 9-10.

### Revelation 20:9 (Human Enemies -- DESTRUCTION Vocabulary)
**Context:** The human armies surround the camp of the saints and the beloved city.
**Direct statement:** "Fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
**Key observations:**
- The verb is katephagen (G2719, "devoured") -- destruction vocabulary.
- The subject is the human armies from v.8.
- The text does not say they were "tormented." It says they were "devoured."
- Katephagen is an aorist active indicative -- a completed action. The fire devoured (consumed) them.
- This parallels 2 Kings 1:10,12 where fire from heaven "consumed" (akal) the soldiers; Num 16:35 where fire "consumed" the 250 men; Lev 10:2 where fire "devoured" (akal) Nadab and Abihu.
**Cross-references:** The fire-from-heaven-devours pattern in the OT consistently describes complete consumption, not ongoing torment. The same verb (katesthio) is used in Heb 10:27: "fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."

### Revelation 20:10 (Devil, Beast, False Prophet -- TORMENT Vocabulary)
**Context:** After the human armies are devoured (v.9), the devil is cast into the lake of fire where the beast and false prophet already are (from Rev 19:20).
**Direct statement:** "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
**Key observations:**

**Subject identification:**
- Subject 1: The devil (diabolos, G1228) -- a non-human supernatural spirit being. Rev 12:9 and 20:2 identify him as the dragon, old serpent, Satan. He is consistently a supernatural entity throughout Scripture (38 NT occurrences of diabolos).
- Subject 2: The beast (therion, G2342) -- a symbolic apocalyptic entity. Rises from the sea (13:1), has seven heads and ten horns, receives authority from the dragon (13:2), is identified by a number (13:18). Rev 17:8 says the beast "was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit." This is not a literal human being.
- Subject 3: The false prophet (pseudoprophetes, G5578) -- a symbolic apocalyptic entity. This is the second beast of Rev 13:11-17 who works miracles, makes fire come from heaven, and gives life to the image of the beast. The singular "the false prophet" (3 occurrences: Rev 16:13; 19:20; 20:10) is distinct from generic "false prophets" (plural, 8 occurrences referring to a class of humans).

**Tree 3 Gate 1 (Subject Gate) Application:**
- Gate 1 asks: "Is the grammatical subject a literal human being?"
- Automatic FAIL criteria include: "A symbolic entity (a figure in an apocalyptic vision)" and "A non-human spirit being."
- The devil: Non-human spirit being. FAIL.
- The beast: Symbolic entity in an apocalyptic vision. FAIL.
- The false prophet: Symbolic entity in an apocalyptic vision. FAIL.
- Result: Gate 1 FAIL for all three subjects. The torment formula is predicated of entities that are not literal human beings.

**Tree 3 Gate 3 (Genre Gate) Application:**
- Gate 3 asks: "Is the passage didactic prose?"
- Revelation is an apocalyptic vision. Nave's classifies the book under VISION (E349). Rev 1:1 states the book communicates through signs -- semaino (E350).
- FAIL: "Genre is apocalyptic vision."

**The verb "basanisthesontai" (shall be tormented):**
- 3rd person plural future passive indicative of basanizo (G928).
- The grammatical subject of this verb is the three entities named in the verse: devil, beast, false prophet.
- The verb does not grammatically extend to the human armies of v.9 (who were "devoured") or to the humans of vv.14-15 (who enter the lake as "second death").

**The "for ever and ever" formula:**
- "Eis tous aionas ton aionon" -- the same formula used ~19 times for God/Christ (doxological) and in Rev 14:11, 19:3. In Rev 19:3, the same formula is applied to Babylon's smoke, where Babylon is "utterly burned" (18:8), "found no more at all" (18:21). Same author, same book, same formula describes a completed destruction.

### Revelation 19:19-21 (Beast and False Prophet Captured)
**Context:** The battle at the return of Christ.
**Direct statement:** "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him... These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword."
**Key observations:**
- The beast and false prophet are cast "alive" (zontes) into the lake of fire.
- The human remnant were "slain" (v.21) -- a different outcome.
- The text again distinguishes between the symbolic entities (cast alive into the lake) and the humans (slain).
- The human followers die; the symbolic entities continue into the lake. This distinction is consistent throughout the passage.

### Revelation 20:11-13 (Great White Throne Judgment)
**Context:** The dead, small and great, stand before God. Books are opened. Judgment according to works.
**Direct statement:** The sea, death, and hades deliver up the dead. They are judged according to their works.
**Key observations:** This is the judgment of individual human beings. The vocabulary is "judged" (krino, G2919) -- not "tormented." The text describes a judicial proceeding.

### Revelation 20:14 (Death and Hades Cast In -- "Second Death")
**Context:** After the judgment of v.12-13.
**Direct statement:** "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
**Key observations:**
- Death and hades are personified/abstracted entities cast into the lake.
- The text provides an identity statement: "This is the second death."
- The lake of fire IS the second death. The text equates them.
- No torment language is attached. The identifying term is thanatos (G2288, death).

### Revelation 20:15 (Human Wicked Cast In -- NO Torment Formula)
**Context:** After the identity statement of v.14.
**Direct statement:** "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."
**Key observations:**
- The subject is now explicitly human: "whosoever" (ei tis, "if anyone").
- The text says they were "cast into the lake of fire."
- The text does NOT append the torment formula ("tormented day and night for ever and ever").
- The text does NOT say "and shall be tormented."
- The preceding verse (v.14) has identified the lake as "the second death."
- The vocabulary used when humans enter the lake is death, not torment.

### Revelation 21:8 (Eight Categories -- "Second Death")
**Context:** The new heaven and new earth. God enumerates those excluded.
**Direct statement:** "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
**Key observations:**
- Eight categories of human wicked are named.
- Their fate is described as "the second death."
- The text does not use basanizo or basanismos.
- The identifying term is again thanatos (death), not basanizo (torment).
- This is the text's own name for the lake of fire when applied to human beings.

### Revelation 14:9-11 (Beast-Worshippers -- Apocalyptic Context)
**Context:** Angelic warning in John's vision.
**Direct statement:** "He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever."
**Key observations:**
- The subjects are beast-worshippers -- humans described in relation to the apocalyptic beast.
- This passage uses basanizo (v.10) and basanismos (v.11) in the context of beast-worship.
- Tree 3 Gate 3 FAIL: apocalyptic vision genre.
- The text is situated within Revelation's symbolic framework. *(Examined in depth in etc-11-smoke-ascending-forever.)*

## The Subject Differentiation Pattern in Revelation 20:7-15

The text uses distinct vocabulary for distinct subjects across the passage:

| Verses | Subject | Vocabulary | Category |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 20:9 | Human armies (Gog/Magog) | "devoured" (katephagen) | Destruction |
| 20:10 | Devil, beast, false prophet | "tormented day and night for ever and ever" | Torment formula |
| 20:14 | Death and hades | "cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." | Death identity |
| 20:15 | Human wicked ("whosoever") | "cast into the lake of fire" | No torment language appended |
| 21:8 | Eight categories of human wicked | "the second death" | Death identity |

Additionally, in Rev 19:20-21:
| Verses | Subject | Vocabulary | Category |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 19:20 | Beast and false prophet | "cast alive into a lake of fire" | Cast alive (continue) |
| 19:21 | Human remnant | "slain with the sword" | Death |

The text itself makes this distinction. When human enemies face fire, they are "devoured" (20:9) or "slain" (19:21). When humans enter the lake, it is "the second death" (20:14; 21:8). The torment formula ("tormented day and night for ever and ever") is applied to the devil, beast, and false prophet -- not to humans.

## Basanizo (G928) Semantic Range Analysis

### Distribution by Category (12 Occurrences)

**Non-judgment contexts (7 of 12):**
1. Matt 8:6 -- Physical illness ("grievously tormented" = sick of palsy)
2. Matt 14:24 -- Waves tossing a boat ("tossed with waves")
3. Mark 6:48 -- Physical exertion ("toiling in rowing")
4. 2 Pet 2:8 -- Moral/emotional distress ("vexed his righteous soul")
5. Rev 12:2 -- Childbirth labor ("pained to be delivered")
6. Mark 5:7 -- Demon's fear of judgment ("torment me not")
7. Luke 8:28 -- Demon's fear of judgment ("torment me not")

**Judgment contexts (5 of 12 -- all in apocalyptic/demonic framework):**
1. Matt 8:29 -- Demons speaking about their own judgment ("torment us before the time")
2. Rev 9:5 -- Locusts with 5-month time limit ("tormented five months")
3. Rev 11:10 -- Two prophets' witness as "torment" ("tormented them that dwelt on the earth")
4. Rev 14:10 -- Beast-worshippers in apocalyptic vision
5. Rev 20:10 -- Devil, beast, false prophet in apocalyptic vision

### Observations

1. The KJV translates basanizo as: tormented, tossed, toiling, vexed, pained, torment. The word covers physical suffering, labor exertion, emotional distress, weather disturbance, childbirth, and divine judgment. It is not a technical term for eschatological punishment.

2. Seven of twelve uses (58%) are not about eschatological judgment. These include a sick servant, a boat in a storm, disciples rowing, Lot's emotional distress, and a woman in childbirth.

3. All five judgment uses are within the apocalyptic framework (four in Revelation) or involve demons speaking about their own future (Matt 8:29).

4. When basanizo appears with eschatological fear, the speakers in the Gospels are demons -- supernatural entities, not humans (Matt 8:29; Mark 5:7; Luke 8:28).

5. Rev 9:5 uses basanizo with an explicit five-month time limit. The word itself does not inherently mean "eternal."

6. Rev 11:10 uses basanizo for the prophets' testimony causing distress to earth-dwellers. The "torment" is the prophetic witness, not fire.

7. No epistle, no Gospel, and no OT passage uses basanizo or basanismos for the final fate of generic human wicked. The eschatological torment vocabulary is confined to Revelation's apocalyptic framework (plus the demonic statements in the Synoptics).

---

## Basanismos (G929) Same-Book Context

All six occurrences of basanismos are in Revelation:
- Rev 9:5 -- explicit 5-month time limit
- Rev 14:11 -- smoke of torment ascending
- Rev 18:7, 18:10, 18:15 -- Babylon's "torment"

Three of six (50%) describe Babylon's "torment," which IS Babylon's completed destruction: "utterly burned with fire" (18:8), "in one hour is thy judgment come" (18:10), "thrown down, and shall be found no more at all" (18:21). Babylon's basanismos is not ongoing conscious suffering -- it is the experience of undergoing a completed, irreversible destructive judgment.

## The Extension Argument (Does Rev 20:10 Apply to Humans?)

The claim that the fate described for the devil, beast, and false prophet in Rev 20:10 applies equally to all unsaved humans (I054 in master evidence) requires analysis.

**What the text says:**
- Rev 20:10 names three subjects: devil, beast, false prophet.
- Rev 20:9 uses "devoured" for the human armies.
- Rev 20:15 says humans are "cast into the lake of fire" -- no torment formula appended.
- Rev 21:8 calls the lake "the second death" for eight categories of human wicked.
- Matt 25:41 states the everlasting fire was "prepared for the devil and his angels" -- not originally prepared for humans.

**What the claim adds:**
- The claim requires adding: "All unsaved humans experience what Rev 20:10 describes for the devil, beast, and false prophet."
- The text does not make this statement. The text uses different vocabulary for different subjects.
- The text's own terminology for the human experience of the lake of fire is "the second death" -- death vocabulary, not torment vocabulary.
- The claim requires the reader to supply the connection between the fate of non-human/symbolic entities and the fate of literal humans. The text itself does not establish this equivalence.

**The shared destination argument:**
- ECT proponents note that humans (Rev 20:15) enter the same lake of fire where the devil, beast, and false prophet are. From this, they infer that humans experience the same fate.
- The text states that humans enter the same destination. It does not state that they experience the same outcome. The lake is called "the second death" for humans (20:14; 21:8) and described with the torment formula for the three non-human/symbolic entities (20:10).
- The inference that "same destination = same experience" requires adding a concept the text does not contain. It is classified I-C (compatible external) because it does not override any E/N statement but extends beyond what the text states.

## Human Fate Vocabulary Outside Revelation

When the NT describes the final fate of human wicked outside Revelation, the vocabulary is consistently destruction/death:

| Passage | Vocabulary | Category |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Matt 10:28 | "destroy" (apollymi) soul and body in gehenna | Destruction |
| 2 Thess 1:9 | "everlasting destruction" (olethros aionios) | Destruction |
| Rom 6:23 | "wages of sin is death" (thanatos) | Death |
| John 3:16 | "not perish" (apollymi) | Destruction |
| Phil 3:19 | "whose end is destruction" (apoleia) | Destruction |
| 2 Pet 3:7 | "perdition" (apoleia) of ungodly men | Destruction |
| Gal 6:8 | "reap corruption" (phthora) | Corruption |
| Matt 7:13 | "broad way that leads to destruction" (apoleia) | Destruction |
| Heb 10:27 | "fiery indignation which shall devour" | Destruction |
| Matt 25:46 | "everlasting punishment" (kolasis aionios) | Punishment (not torment) |
| Matt 25:41 | "everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels" | Fire prepared for non-human entities |

No epistle, no Gospel, and no OT passage applies basanizo or basanismos to the final fate of generic human wicked. The torment formula ("tormented day and night for ever and ever") appears once in Scripture -- Rev 20:10 -- and is applied to the devil, beast, and false prophet.

---

## Patterns Identified

1. **Subject differentiation is textual, not interpretive.** The text itself uses different vocabulary for the three non-human/symbolic entities (tormented) versus the human armies (devoured) versus the human wicked (second death). This pattern holds across Rev 19:20-21; 20:9-10; 20:14-15; 21:8.

2. **Basanizo is not a technical eschatological term.** Its semantic range includes physical illness, waves tossing a boat, rowing exertion, emotional distress, childbirth, demonic fear, and divine judgment. The eschatological judgment uses are all in Revelation's apocalyptic framework.

3. **The "tormented for ever and ever" formula is unique to Rev 20:10.** It appears once in Scripture, applied to three non-human/symbolic entities. It is not applied to human beings anywhere in the Bible.

4. **The lake of fire has two names depending on the subject.** For the devil/beast/false prophet, it is described with the torment formula. For humans, it is called "the second death." The text itself provides this distinction.

5. **Tree 3 Gates 1 and 3 both FAIL for Rev 20:10.** Gate 1 (Subject): all three subjects are non-human or symbolic. Gate 3 (Genre): Revelation is apocalyptic vision. Both failures prevent Rev 20:10 from functioning as positional evidence about the fate of literal human beings.

6. **Matt 25:41 states the everlasting fire was "prepared for the devil and his angels."** The fire's primary designation is for supernatural entities. Humans are sent there secondarily. The punishment vocabulary for humans in Matt 25:46 is kolasis (punishment), not basanizo (torment).

---

## Connections Between Passages

- Rev 19:20 (beast/false prophet cast alive into lake) -> Rev 20:10 (devil joins them; torment formula applied) -> Rev 20:14-15 (humans enter; term is "second death"). The narrative sequence shows a progression where the symbolic entities arrive first and receive the torment formula; humans arrive later and receive death terminology.

- Rev 20:9 (humans devoured by fire from heaven) occurs in the same passage as Rev 20:10 (torment formula for devil/beast/false prophet). The immediate juxtaposition of "devoured" for humans and "tormented" for non-human/symbolic entities is a same-passage vocabulary distinction by the same author.

- Rev 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers tormented) uses basanizo/basanismos in the context of Revelation's apocalyptic beast-narrative. The subjects are defined by their relation to the symbolic beast. *(Examined in depth in etc-11.)*

- Matt 25:41 states the fire was "prepared for the devil and his angels." This is the only passage that directly connects humans to the devil's fire, and it does so by stating humans are sent to a fire prepared for others. The punishment vocabulary for humans in v.46 is kolasis, not basanizo.

---

## Word Study Insights

**Basanizo (G928):** The lexicon defines it as "to torture: pain, toil, torment, toss, vex." The KJV translates it eleven different ways across twelve occurrences. A word translated "tossed" (of waves), "toiling" (of rowing), "vexed" (of emotional distress), and "pained" (of childbirth) is not a technical term for eternal conscious punishment.

**Basanismos (G929):** All six occurrences are in Revelation. Three of six describe Babylon's completed destruction. One has a five-month time limit. The word describes the experience of undergoing judgment -- it does not inherently specify duration.

**Basanos (G931):** Three occurrences. Used for physical diseases (Matt 4:24) and in the parabolic context of Luke 16 (Rich Man and Lazarus). Not used in any eschatological judgment passage.

**Therion (G2342):** The Revelation "beast" (38+ of 46 occurrences) is a symbolic entity with seven heads, ten horns, rising from the sea, identified by a number. It "was, and is not, and shall ascend" (Rev 17:8). This is not a literal human being.

**Pseudoprophetes (G5578):** THE false prophet in Revelation (3 of 11 occurrences) is the second beast of Rev 13:11-17, a specific symbolic figure distinct from generic "false prophets" (plural, 8 occurrences).

**Diabolos (G1228):** Consistently a non-human supernatural entity throughout the NT (38 occurrences). Heb 2:14 states Christ came to "destroy" (katargeo) the one with the power of death -- the devil. Destruction vocabulary applied to the devil.

---

## Difficult Passages

### Matt 25:41 -- Everlasting Fire Prepared for the Devil
The text states "everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." ECT proponents cite this as connecting human fate to the devil's fate. The text does connect humans to the same fire. However: (1) the fire is stated to be "prepared for the devil and his angels" -- its primary designation is for non-human entities; (2) the punishment vocabulary for humans in v.46 is kolasis (punishment), not basanizo (torment); (3) kolasis (G2851) occurs only twice in the NT (here and 1 John 4:18), and its lexical definition includes "pruning/curtailment," not ongoing conscious suffering; (4) the adjective aionios does not inherently mean "eternal/endless" *(examined in etc-08)*; (5) the passage is parabolic in form (sheep/goats separation narrative).

### Matt 8:29 -- Demons Ask About Torment "Before the Time"
The demons ask: "Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?" This shows supernatural entities expecting basanizo as their judgment. The speakers are demons -- non-human spirit beings. This is consistent with Rev 20:10, where non-human/symbolic entities receive the torment formula. The passage does not apply basanizo to human beings.

### The Shared Destination Question
Humans are cast into the same lake of fire as the devil, beast, and false prophet (Rev 20:15). The question is whether same destination requires same experience. The text provides two different descriptions of what happens at that destination: "tormented" for the three non-human/symbolic entities (20:10) and "second death" for humans (20:14-15; 21:8). The text itself distinguishes between these outcomes. Reading "same destination = same experience" requires adding a concept the text does not state, especially when the text provides different terminology for different subjects at that same destination.
