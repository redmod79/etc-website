## 1. Rev 20:7-15 — Subject Differentiation Analysis

### Structural Overview of Rev 20:7-15

The pericope Rev 20:7-15 contains four distinct outcomes for four distinct groups within a single narrative unit. The text applies different vocabulary to each group:

| Verse | Subject | Verb/Language | Vocabulary Type |
|-------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| v.9 | Nations surrounding the camp (human armies) | "devoured [katephagen — ate up/consumed]" | Consumption / destruction |
| v.10 | Devil, beast, false prophet (supernatural trio) | "cast in" + "shall be tormented [basanisthesontai] day and night for ever and ever" | Torment formula |
| v.14 | Death and hades (conceptual/personified) | "cast in" + "this is the second death" | Death identity |
| v.15 | "Whosoever not found written in the book of life" (human wicked) | "was cast into the lake of fire" | Cast-in only; no torment formula |

This vocabulary differentiation within a single author, a single chapter, and adjacent verses is a textual pattern both sides must acknowledge.

### Rev 20:9 — Nations Devoured

"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured [katephagen — G2719, kataphago = to eat up/consume] them."

The nations who participate in the final battle against the camp of the saints are described with consumption/destruction vocabulary: kataphago (ate up, consumed). This is the same verb used in Matt 13:4 (birds devoured seed) and other passages describing complete consumption. The destruction of these human armies is expressed by a word meaning total consumption.

This establishes the immediately preceding context for v.10. The nations receive consumption language in v.9; the following verse uses the torment formula for the three named supernatural entities. The vocabulary contrast is observable within two consecutive verses (E180, established etc5-06).

### Rev 20:10 — The Devil, the Beast, and the False Prophet

"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented [basanisthesontai — G928, Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural] day and night for ever and ever [eis tous aionas ton aionon]."

**Grammatical subjects of basanisthesontai:**

Greek parsing confirms the verb βασανισθήσονται is Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural of G928 (basanizo). The grammatical subjects in the nominative are three named entities:
- ὁ διάβολος (G1228, A-NSM) — the devil
- τὸ θηρίον (G2342, N-NSN) — the beast
- ὁ ψευδοπροφήτης (G5578, N-NSM) — the false prophet

All three are nominative-case noun phrases. None of these are human beings. The beast and false prophet were already in the lake at Rev 19:20; the devil joins them at Rev 20:10. The ὅπου ("where") locates the devil's destination as the same place the beast and false prophet already are — a backward reference to Rev 19:20.

**The torment formula:**

The formula "tormented day and night for ever and ever" (βασανισθήσονται ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων) is:
- Future tense: this torment will occur (not yet occurring at time of writing)
- Passive voice: inflicted upon the three (they receive it)
- 3rd Plural: the three named entities are the grammatical referent

The formula εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων ("into the ages of the ages") is the same formula used approximately 11 times in Revelation for God, Christ, and the redeemed (Rev 1:6; 4:9; 4:10; 5:13; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 15:3; 15:7; 22:5), and 3 times in judgment contexts (Rev 14:11; 19:3; 20:10) — established as E256 (etc5-11).

The torment formula applies to exactly these three named subjects and is not repeated for any other group in Rev 20.

### Rev 20:14 — Death and Hades Cast In

"And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death [οὗτος ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός ἐστιν, ἡ λίμνη τοῦ πυρός]."

Death and hades are cast into the lake — the same casting verb (G906 ballo, Aorist Passive) — but receive neither the torment formula ("tormented day and night for ever and ever") nor the death-language in their own naming. Instead, the text provides an equative sentence: "this IS the second death." The copula ἐστιν (Present Active Indicative of eimi) identifies the lake of fire as the second death. Hades, established as the temporary pre-resurrection holding state (N026), ends here: it is cast in and its identity is absorbed into the second death designation.

### Rev 20:15 — Human Wicked Cast In

"And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."

Greek parsing of v.15: τις (anyone, X-NSM) + οὐχ εὑρέθη (Aorist Passive Indicative 3rd Singular: "was not found") + βίβλῳ τῆς ζωῆς (book of life) + γεγραμμένος (Perfect Passive Participle NSM: "having been written") + ἐβλήθη (G906, Aorist Passive Indicative 3rd Singular: "was cast").

The grammatical structure is simple and brief: a conditional relative clause followed by the casting verb. No torment formula is appended. The human wicked receive:
- "cast in" (eblēthē — same verb as in v.10 for the devil, v.14 for death/hades)
- No "tormented day and night for ever and ever"
- No description of their ongoing experience

The text treats vv.10 and 15 as adjacent but distinct. v.10 names specific supernatural entities and appends the torment formula; v.15 names the generic human category and appends nothing beyond the casting act. The absence is a textual observation (E212, established etc5-08).

## 2. Rev 19:20 — Beast and False Prophet Cast "Alive" into the Lake

"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet... These both were cast alive [ζῶντες — G2198, Present Active Participle Nominative Plural Masculine] into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."

**ζῶντες (zontes):** Present Active Participle of G2198 (zao = to live). Parsed as V-PAP-NPM — nominative plural masculine, agreeing with the two subjects (beast and false prophet). The present participle denotes the state at the time of the action: they were cast in while being alive. This contrasts explicitly with the human remnant in the next verse (Rev 19:21): "the remnant were slain with the sword" — they die by the sword before any lake-of-fire fate.

This is the first appearance of the lake of fire in Revelation. The two entities cast in are:
1. Already introduced as non-human entities: the beast (Rev 13 — the political/apocalyptic entity from the sea) and the false prophet (the second beast of Rev 13:11-18, who performs signs)
2. Cast in while living (zontes) — a state not described for human beings at judgment

The torment formula does not appear at Rev 19:20. It is introduced at Rev 20:10 when the devil joins them in the lake. The three together (devil, beast, false prophet) are then described as the subjects of the torment formula.

The beast and false prophet's being cast in "alive" distinguishes them from the human armies of Rev 19:21 who are "slain" (killed) first. Human beings who face the lake of fire at Rev 20:15 come to it through death, resurrection, and judgment (vv.12-15). The beast and false prophet come to it alive, bypassing the death-resurrection-judgment sequence that applies to mortals.

The high-scoring NT parallel for Rev 19:20 is Rev 20:10 (hybrid 0.641) — confirming the textual connection: the "where the beast and false prophet are" of Rev 20:10 refers back specifically to Rev 19:20 as the place and state where they were cast.

---

## 3. Rev 20:10 — The Torment Formula: Analysis

### Vocabulary

The verb is G928 (basanizo), Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural. G928 appears 12 times in the NT. Its eschatological uses in Revelation are:
- Rev 9:5 — scorpion torment for five months (explicitly bounded)
- Rev 14:10 — beast-worshippers tormented (IB009 resolved Strong toward literary-formula/desolation; IB014 Moderate toward judgment-process)
- Rev 20:10 — devil/beast/false prophet tormented day and night for ever and ever

G929 (basanismos, the torment noun) does NOT appear in Rev 20:10 — the verb form G928 is used there. G929 appears 6 times in the NT, all in Revelation: three uses for Babylon's sudden "one-hour" judgment (Rev 18:7,10,15), one for the five-month bounded torment (Rev 9:5), one for the beast-worshippers' smoke (Rev 14:11).

### Nature of the Subjects

The three subjects of Rev 20:10's torment formula are:

**The devil (diabolos, G1228):** A supernatural adversarial being. Described in Rev 12:9 as "the great dragon... that old serpent called the Devil, and Satan." In Rev 20:2, identified as "the Dragon, that old Serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan." Bound for a thousand years (Rev 20:1-3), released (Rev 20:7), leads the final rebellion (vv.8-9), then cast into the lake. His final fate is described by both Rev 20:10 (torment formula) and Heb 2:14 (Christ destroys/renders inoperative [katargesē, G2673] him who had the power of death).

**The beast (therion, G2342):** The apocalyptic entity of Rev 13, 17, 19. Its destiny is described twice as "going into perdition [apoleia]" (Rev 17:8, 11 — E179). It is cast alive into the lake (Rev 19:20). In Rev 20:10 it is where the devil is cast. Whether the beast is a human person, a supernatural entity, a political empire, or a supernatural power working through political systems is a question the text does not resolve definitively. What is clear is that the beast is treated differently from generic human beings throughout Revelation: it bypasses the death-resurrection-judgment sequence.

**The false prophet (pseudoprophetes, G5578):** The second beast of Rev 13:11-18, who performs signs and deceives. Also cast alive into the lake (Rev 19:20). Its being "alive" when cast in, and its residence in the lake prior to the thousand-year millennium and the final judgment of the human wicked, distinguishes it from the human dead who are judged at the great white throne (vv.11-15).

### The For-Ever-And-Ever Formula in Revelation

E256 (established etc5-11) documents the distribution of εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων in Revelation:
- 11 applications to God, Christ, and the redeemed
- 3 applications in judgment contexts: Rev 14:11 (beast-worshippers' smoke), Rev 19:3 (Babylon's smoke), Rev 20:10 (devil/beast/false prophet tormented)

IB009 (STRONG resolution toward literary-formula/desolation, established etc5-11) established that:
- Rev 19:3 applies the identical formula (kapnos + anabainei + eis tous aionas ton aionon) to Babylon — a city described as destroyed "in one hour" (Rev 18:10,17,19) and "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21)
- This within-book demonstration (same author, same book, identical formula, demonstrably completed destruction) means the formula cannot be read as necessarily implying ongoing conscious perpetual experience

The question this raises for Rev 20:10: Does the within-book demonstration of IB009 (formula for Babylon = completed destruction) also govern the same formula applied to the devil/beast/false prophet?

The IB009 resolution (Strong toward literary-formula/desolation) was established for Rev 14:11. Rev 20:10 applies the formula to a different and more specific set of subjects: three named supernatural entities who are being tormented (the verb basanizō is explicit), not merely whose smoke is ascending. The text describes their torment directly, not via a smoke ascent. This creates a distinction:
- Rev 14:11 (IB009): smoke of torment ascends for ever → formula governs the smoke imagery
- Rev 19:3 (IB009): smoke of Babylon ascends for ever → formula = completed destruction
- Rev 20:10: the three entities SHALL BE TORMENTED (verb) day and night for ever and ever → the formula modifies the active torment verb directly

This distinction is addressed in the I-B analysis below (new IB015).

## 4. Rev 20:14-15 — Human Wicked: Second Death Language

### Rev 20:14

The "second death" language was established as N021 (Conditionalist, first appeared etc5-03): "The second death IS the lake of fire, by explicit textual identification." The equative construction (οὗτος ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερός ἐστιν, ἡ λίμνη τοῦ πυρός) makes the identification explicit and unambiguous.

For the human wicked (those cast in at v.15), the lake of fire is called the "second death." The name the text gives the lake's function for human beings is DEATH — not "second torment" or "eternal conscious suffering." The same word (G2288 thanatos) is used throughout the NT for biological death and the cessation of life.

### Rev 20:15

The verse casts human wicked into the lake with no torment language added. The action verb (eblēthē — was cast) is an Aorist Passive — a single completed action. The cast-in language is identical in form to the casting of the devil in v.10 (also eblēthē) and death/hades in v.14 (eblēthēsan). What differs is what follows: for the devil, "and shall be tormented..." is appended; for the human wicked, nothing is appended beyond the casting.

## 5. Rev 21:8 — Second Death for Human Wicked (Comprehensive)

"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death [ὅ ἐστιν ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος]."

Rev 21:8 names eight categories of human sinners — all human categories, not supernatural entities. The outcome is described as "the second death." The verse uses:
- τὸ μέρος αὐτῶν (their part/portion — N-NSN = share/allotment language)
- ἐν τῇ λίμνῃ τῇ καιομένῃ (in the burning lake)
- ὅ ἐστιν (which is — relative clause equating the lake with:)
- ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος (the second death)

No G928/G929 torment vocabulary appears in Rev 21:8. The eight human categories who end up in the lake receive the label "the second death," not "tormented for ever and ever."

The preceding verse (Rev 21:4) states: "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." This describes the new creation from the perspective of the redeemed. If the wicked simultaneously experience eternal conscious torment in the lake of fire, the "no more pain" characterizes only the experience of those in the new Jerusalem, not a universal claim about what exists. Neither the ECT nor the conditionalist position requires the verse to be universal in scope here; it describes the new creation for its inhabitants.

---

## 6. Rev 14:9-11 — The Competing Evidence for Human Eternal Torment (IB008 Update)

This passage is the NT text most directly cited for ongoing conscious torment of human beings, having been analyzed in prior studies. The relevant items are:

- **E150** (Neutral, reclassified from ECT in etc5-18 audit): beast-worshippers "tormented [basanisthēsetai, G928] with fire and brimstone... smoke of their torment [basanismou, G929] ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night"
- **IB008** (Moderate AGAINST universal extension): the torment language applies to a specific defined group (beast-worshippers), not all human wicked
- **IB009** (STRONG toward literary-formula/desolation): the smoke-for-ever formula drawn from Isa 34:10's desolation imagery and confirmed by Rev 19:3's within-book use of the identical formula for Babylon's completed destruction
- **IB014** (Moderate toward judgment-process reading): the "no rest day nor night" phrase identical to Rev 4:8's description of the living creatures' unceasing worship

The subjects in Rev 14:9-11 are specifically "any man who worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark" — a tribulation-era class, not all human beings generally. The torment language is not applied to the general mass of the wicked throughout the NT; it is confined to this specific group in Revelation (Rev 14:10-11) and to the supernatural trio (Rev 20:10). IB008's Moderate resolution against universal extension remains the standing assessment.

IB008 is updated with "etc5-12" in its "Also In" field. No change in resolution.

## 7. Mat 25:41,46 — Everlasting Fire and Punishment for Humans

### Mat 25:41

"Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire [τὸ πῦρ τὸ αἰώνιον], prepared [ἡτοιμασμένον — Perfect Passive Participle] for the devil [τῷ διαβόλῳ — Dative of purpose] and his angels [τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ — Dative]."

**The fire's intended recipients:** The fire was prepared FOR (dative of purpose/indirect object) the devil and his angels — supernatural beings. Human sinners are sent INTO the fire already prepared for supernatural entities. The Perfect Passive Participle (hetoimasmenon = "having been prepared") indicates the fire was already in a state of readiness; its primary named intended recipients are named as supernatural (E214, established etc5-08).

**No torment vocabulary:** No G928 (basanizo) or G929 (basanismos) appears in v.41. The mechanism is described as fire, not explicitly as torment. Human beings are said to "depart into" the fire (using poreuō) — movement to a destination, not an ongoing-torment description.

### Mat 25:46

"And these shall go away [ἀπελεύσονται — Future Middle Indicative 3rd Plural] into everlasting punishment [κόλασιν αἰώνιον — G2851 + G166]: but the righteous into life eternal [ζωὴν αἰώνιον — G2222 + G166]."

**The noun kolasis (G2851):** The word used for the wicked's outcome is kolasis — NOT basanismos (G929 = torment) and NOT olethros (G3639 = destruction). Kolasis appears only twice in the NT: Mat 25:46 and 1 Jn 4:18 ("fear hath torment [kolasis]" — a psychological dread, not a final eschatological mechanism). The word's etymology is kolazo (to prune/curtail/punish) — a penal category, not a specified mechanism. The word designates that the outcome is PUNITIVE in character without specifying whether that punishment consists of ongoing conscious suffering or destruction.

**The grammatical symmetry:** Both αἰώνιον instances are parsed identically as A-ASF (Accusative Singular Feminine) — IB012's Moderate resolution toward referent-nature interpretation, established etc5-08. The nouns differ: kolasis (punishment/penal infliction) vs. zoe (life as an inherently ongoing state). The subjects differ: the wicked vs. the righteous.

**What Mat 25:46 adds to the evidence base:** This verse establishes that human beings who face eschatological judgment go to "everlasting punishment" (kolasis aionion). The word kolasis designates the punitive/penal category of the outcome. Neither the ECT reading (kolasis = ongoing conscious torment) nor the conditionalist reading (kolasis = permanent destructive punishment) is ruled out by the word alone. The verse is genuinely neutral regarding the mechanism, making it a Neutral E item.

---

## 8. "Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth" — What These Passages Describe

All seven "wailing and gnashing" passages (Mat 8:12; 13:42; 13:50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luk 13:28) use:
- G2805 (klauthmos = weeping/wailing/lamentation)
- G1030 (brygmos = gnashing)

Both nouns describe emotional and physical responses. Neither word refers to a specific duration or mechanism of punishment.

**Contextual settings of the seven passages:**
- 3 passages: "outer darkness" (Mat 8:12; 22:13; 25:30) — exclusion/absence from the light/kingdom
- 2 passages: "furnace of fire" (Mat 13:42; 13:50) — burning/consuming imagery
- 1 passage: "with the hypocrites" (Mat 24:51) — consequence-without-further-description
- 1 passage: "thrust out" from the kingdom (Luk 13:28) — exclusion from the kingdom when the patriarchs and prophets are within

**Outer darkness and furnace of fire as different settings:** Three passages place the weeping/gnashing in "outer darkness" and two in a "furnace of fire." If both describe the same final state, there is tension between the two descriptions: outer darkness and fire/furnace are physically incompatible images, suggesting these are parabolic/symbolic rather than literal spatial descriptions of a single ongoing state.

**Grammatical observations:** The verbs of casting (eblēthē — aorist) describe completed, punctual actions. The weeping and gnashing are described as what follows or accompanies the judgment/exclusion. The grammar does not assert that the weeping and gnashing are eternal, ongoing, or continuous — the passages describe the emotional response at the moment of condemnation or exclusion.

**Parabolic context:** The majority of these passages occur within parables (tares = 13:42; dragnet = 13:50; wedding garment = 22:13; talent/mina = 25:30; evil servant = 24:51). Parabolic imagery uses earthly scenarios to illustrate theological truth; the specific images (outer darkness, gnashing, furnace) are the vehicle, not necessarily a literal account of the final state.

These passages do not use G928/G929 (torment vocabulary). They do not use the "for ever and ever" formula. They describe the response to judgment and exclusion without specifying the duration or mechanism of what follows. They add to the evidence base as descriptions of the moment of condemnation rather than as assertions about ongoing eternal conscious suffering.

## 9. Heb 2:14 — Christ Destroys the Devil (Katargeō)

"...that through death he might destroy [καταργήσῃ — G2673, Aorist Active Subjunctive 3rd Singular] him that had the power of death, that is, the devil [τὸν διάβολον]."

G2673 (katargeō) = to render inoperative, abolish, bring to nothing, put an end to. 27 NT occurrences. It is NOT G622 (apollumi = destroy fully/perish) and not G928 (basanizō = torment). The purpose clause (ἵνα καταργήσῃ = "in order that he might render inoperative") expresses the goal of Christ's incarnation and death.

The destruction targets specifically "him that had [εἴχοντα — Present Active Participle Accusative Singular Masculine: 'the one having'] the power [κράτος] of death" — describing the devil's power-over-death as what is being destroyed.

**The tension with Rev 20:10:** Heb 2:14 says Christ "destroys/renders inoperative" the devil through his death. Rev 20:10 says the devil is "tormented day and night for ever and ever" in the lake of fire. These two statements are not necessarily in contradiction:

- ECT reading: Heb 2:14 refers to the breaking of the devil's power over death at the cross; his power is rendered null, but the devil himself continues in conscious existence, ultimately to be tormented in the lake of fire. Rev 20:10 describes his final fate as ongoing conscious torment — consistent with Heb 2:14's rendering inoperative of his power (not his existence).
- Conditionalist reading: Heb 2:14 describes the process by which the devil will ultimately be rendered completely inoperative — brought to nothing. Rev 20:10's torment formula (interpreted through IB009's Strong resolution as the permanent, irrevocable nature of the judgment) describes the irreversible character of his final destruction. The katargeō ("render inoperative") is ultimately fully realized when the devil enters the lake of fire.

The Aorist Subjunctive (katagresē) in a purpose clause describes the goal, not a completed fact at the time of writing. The cross begins the process; the lake of fire may be its completion.

Neither reading is forced by the text alone. The tension is genuinely I-B in character. 1 John 3:8 provides a parallel: "the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy [lysē — G3089 = loose/destroy] the works of the devil" — different verb, same theme.

## 10. Vocabulary Differentiation: Torment vs. Destruction by Subject Type

The research data from this study (and prior studies) establishes the following distributional pattern:

**Torment vocabulary (G928 basanizō, G929 basanismos) in eschatological contexts:**

| Passage | Subject | Verdict |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Rev 9:5 | Human beings (5-month bounded) | Explicit duration bound |
| Rev 14:10-11 | Beast-worshippers (specific tribulation class) | IB009 STRONG → literary-formula |
| Rev 18:7,10,15 | Babylon (conceptual/personified city) | "One hour" completed judgment |
| Rev 20:10 | Devil, beast, false prophet (named supernatural) | Primary text of this study |

**Destruction vocabulary for human wicked broadly (NT):**

| Passage | Word | Subject |
|---------|------|---------|
| Jhn 3:16 | apollumi (G622) | All unbelievers |
| Mat 10:28 | apollumi (G622) | All humans in gehenna |
| Mat 7:13 | apoleia (G684) | Those on broad road |
| Phil 3:19 | apoleia (G684) | Enemies of the cross |
| 2 Th 1:9 | olethros (G3639) | Human wicked (Paul) |
| 2 Pet 2:12 | apollumi (G622) | False teachers |
| Rom 2:12 | apollumi (G622) | Sinners without law |

**N033** (established etc5-06, Neutral): basanizō/basanismos and destruction vocabulary never appear together describing the same subject in the same passage. This is an observable distributional fact.

The distinction is between:
- Human wicked broadly: destruction vocabulary (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora) throughout the NT
- Specific defined groups in Revelation: torment vocabulary (basanizō/basanismos)
- Named supernatural entities (devil, beast, false prophet): torment vocabulary in Rev 20:10

**G2851 (kolasis) for human wicked in Mat 25:46:** Kolasis is a third category — neither destruction vocabulary nor torment vocabulary. It designates the punitive/penal character of the outcome without specifying the mechanism. Its etymology (kolazo = prune/curtail/punish) does not inherently specify either ongoing torment or destruction as the mode.

---

## 11. Subject Differentiation Pattern Throughout NT

The NT consistently applies different language to supernatural beings vs. human beings regarding final fate:

**Supernatural beings:**
- Fallen angels: aidios chains (Jude 1:6, G126), tartaroo confinement (2 Pet 2:4, G5020), reserved unto judgment — confinement language
- Devil: katargeō (Heb 2:14 — render inoperative); tormented for ever (Rev 20:10)
- Beast/false prophet: going into perdition/apoleia (Rev 17:8,11); cast alive into lake (Rev 19:20); tormented for ever (Rev 20:10)
- Everlasting fire prepared FOR devil and his angels (Mat 25:41 — supernatural intended recipients)

**Human beings (general wicked):**
- apollumi (Jhn 3:16; Mat 10:28; Lk 13:3,5; Rom 2:12; 2 Pet 3:9)
- olethros + aionios (2 Th 1:9 — everlasting destruction)
- apoleia (Mat 7:13; Phil 3:19)
- second death = lake of fire (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8) — death language, not torment language
- kolasis aionion (Mat 25:46) — penal category, mechanism unspecified

**Exception:** Rev 14:9-11 applies torment language to human beast-worshippers (E150, IB009). This is the one passage where G928/G929 is used for a specifically defined human group. IB009's Strong resolution (etc5-11) interprets the smoke-for-ever formula as literary-formula/desolation imagery. IB008's Moderate resolution (AGAINST universal extension) addresses the question of scope.

The subject-differentiation pattern is an observable textual pattern both sides must acknowledge. The ECT reading interprets the supernatural-entities' torment as paradigmatic (what happens to supernatural entities also happens to human beings in the lake). The conditionalist reading interprets the differentiated vocabulary as reflecting differentiated outcomes. IA019 (Conditionalist I-A, established etc5-06) systematizes this vocabulary-choice observation.

---

## Patterns Identified

1. **Subject specificity of the torment formula:** The "tormented day and night for ever and ever" formula in Rev 20:10 is grammatically applied to exactly three named supernatural entities. Rev 20:15 (adjacent verse, same author, same passage) casts the generic human wicked into the same lake without repeating the formula.

2. **Death vs. torment language for human wicked:** The lake of fire is called "the second death" (Rev 20:14; 21:8) when its application to human beings is in view. It is called the place of torment when the supernatural trio are described (Rev 20:10). The naming differs by subject.

3. **The five lake-of-fire occurrences in Revelation:** All five (Rev 19:20; 20:10; 20:14; 20:15; 21:8) involve being "cast in" (ballo) but only Rev 20:10 appends the torment formula. The other four do not.

4. **Basanizō confined to specific subjects:** G928 in eschatological Revelation contexts: five-month bounded torment (Rev 9:5), beast-worshippers (Rev 14:10), supernatural trio (Rev 20:10). No epistolary passage uses G928 for the general human wicked.

5. **Mat 25:41,46 — supernatural fire, penal-category punishment:** The everlasting fire of v.41 is prepared for supernatural beings; human sinners go into it. The noun for human outcome (v.46) is kolasis, not basanismos — a category word, not a mechanism word.

6. **Wailing/gnashing passages describe judgment-response, not eternal state:** The emotional vocabulary (klauthmos, brygmos) describes responses at condemnation; the diverse settings (outer darkness, furnace of fire) suggest parabolic rather than literal spatial descriptions.

## Connections Between Passages

**Rev 19:20 → Rev 20:10:** The "where the beast and the false prophet are" of v.10 references v.19:20's prior casting of the beast and false prophet alive into the lake. Rev 20:10 adds the devil and appends the torment formula to all three. The two verses form a sequential unit with Rev 19:20 providing the established presence of the first two entities.

**Rev 20:10 ↔ Rev 14:10-11:** The highest NT parallel for Rev 20:10 is Rev 14:11 (score 0.498). Both share beast-mark-worship vocabulary. IB009 (Strong) resolves the smoke-for-ever formula toward literary-formula/desolation, established through the Rev 19:3 within-book parallel.

**Rev 20:10 ↔ Rev 19:3:** The identical formula (eis tous aionas ton aionon) appears in Rev 19:3 for Babylon's smoke — applied to a city explicitly described as "found no more at all." This within-book demonstration (IB009 STRONG) means the formula cannot necessarily be read as implying ongoing conscious perpetual experience in every application. Whether the same conclusion applies to Rev 20:10's different formulation (torment verb rather than smoke noun) is the new I-B question (IB015).

**Heb 2:14 ↔ Rev 20:10:** The devil's ultimate fate is described differently by different authors in different genres — katargeō (Heb 2:14, purpose clause in didactic letter) and basanisthesontai (Rev 20:10, future passive in apocalyptic vision). Both describe aspects of the devil's judgment; their relationship is not a contradiction but requires interpretive harmonization.

## Word Study Insights

**G928 (basanizō):** Derives from G931 (basanos = touchstone for testing metals). Etymology moves from "testing" to "torture/torment" through intertestamental usage (Maccabees). Not derived from any Hebrew destruction term; no LXX overlap with H6 (abad), H8045 (shamad), or related words (E171).

**G929 (basanismos):** Appears only in Revelation in all of NT. Three uses for Babylon's one-hour completed judgment; one for five-month bounded torment; one for beast-worshippers' smoke (IB009 Strong = literary-formula). The Babylon uses show the noun can describe a completed judicial event described elsewhere as sudden and total.

**G2851 (kolasis):** 2 NT occurrences only. The 1 Jn 4:18 use (fear hath torment/kolasis = present psychological dread) and Mat 25:46 use (everlasting punishment). The word's root (kolazo = to prune/curtail/punish) focuses on punitive restriction, not the mechanism of pain.

**εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων:** Uses G165 (noun, aion) not G166 (adjective, aionios). Established as E213 (Neutral). The formula's distribution in Revelation (11 applications to God/Christ/redeemed; 3 in judgment contexts) is E256 (Neutral).

## Difficult Passages

### Does Rev 20:10's torment verb (not merely the smoke noun) change the IB009 analysis?

IB009 (Strong) applies to the smoke-for-ever formula in Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3. Rev 20:10 uses a different construction: the verb basanisthesontai (shall be tormented) directly as the action, modified by the duration formula. The Rev 19:3 within-book demonstration showed the formula can describe completed destruction when attached to a smoke noun. Whether the same formula attached to an active torment VERB carries a different implication is a question IB009 does not directly address. The new IB015 in the CONCLUSION.md addresses this specifically.

### Do the wailing/gnashing passages describe an ongoing state?

The passages use aorist verbs for the casting (completed action) and describe emotional responses. The language does not assert eternal duration for the weeping/gnashing. However, ECT readers may argue that since the individual is in the lake of fire (eternal), their experience (including weeping/gnashing) is eternal. The text does not specify the duration of the weeping and gnashing; it describes the response to condemnation.

### Does Heb 2:14 require the devil's ultimate annihilation?

G2673 (katargeō) covers a range from "render ineffective" (Rom 3:3,31 — the Jews' unbelief does not katargeō God's faithfulness) to "destroy/abolish" (1 Cor 15:24 — Christ delivers the kingdom after having destroyed all rule/authority/power; 1 Cor 15:26 — the last enemy death shall be katargeō'd/destroyed). The verb admits both a weaker (rendering inoperative) and a stronger (abolishing) reading. 1 Cor 15:26 uses it for the destruction of death — suggesting the stronger reading is within its range. The purpose clause in Heb 2:14 does not specify whether the devil's existence or only his power is ultimately abolished.
