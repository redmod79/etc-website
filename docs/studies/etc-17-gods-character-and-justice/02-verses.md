## CLUSTER 1: God's Self-Declaration — His Character Named

### Exodus 34:6-7 (The LORD's Own Declaration of His Character)
34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful [rachum — H7349] and gracious [channun — H2587], longsuffering [erek appayim — H750 + H639], and abundant in goodness [hesed — H2617] and truth [emet — H571],
34:7 Keeping mercy [hesed] for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear [the guilty]; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.

*Key: The LORD's own self-declaration of character (the formula repeated throughout the OT): rachum (compassionate), channun (gracious), erek appayim (slow to anger, lit. "long of nostrils"), hesed (lovingkindness), emet (truth/faithfulness). God's character is simultaneously: deeply merciful AND committed to justice (not clearing the guilty). Both attributes coexist in the same declaration.*

### Deuteronomy 32:4 (God of Truth, Just and Right)
32:4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment [mishpat — H4941]: a God of truth [emet — H571] and without iniquity, just [tsaddiq — H6662] and right [yashar — H3477] is he.

*Key: The song of Moses ascribes perfect justice and truth to God's character as foundational. "His work is perfect" — God's actions, including judgment, are without defect. "Without iniquity" — no wrongdoing attaches to what God does.*

---

## CLUSTER 2: God as Judge of All the Earth

### Genesis 18:20-25 (Shall Not the Judge of All the Earth Do Right?)
18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
18:21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
18:24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right [mishpat — H4941]?

*Key: Abraham's question in v.25 is the definitive biblical assertion that God's judgment is necessarily right/just. The term mishpat establishes that God's judicial acts must conform to the standard of what is right. Both the protection of the innocent AND the punishment of the guilty are components of doing "right."*

## CLUSTER 3: God's Character in Relation to the Wicked — No Pleasure in Their Death

### Ezekiel 18:23, 30-32 (God Takes No Pleasure in the Death of the Wicked)
18:23 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not rather that he should return from his ways, and live?
18:24 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
18:25 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
18:26 When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.
18:27 Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
18:28 Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
18:29 Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
18:30 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
18:31 Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
18:32 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.

*Key: v.23 and v.32 bracket the chapter's conclusion. God explicitly states he takes "no pleasure" in the death of the wicked. The chapter also establishes proportional individual accountability (vv.24-29) — each person judged "according to his ways" (v.30). God prefers that the wicked live by repenting, not that they die.*

---

### Ezekiel 33:11 (I Have No Pleasure in the Death of the Wicked)
33:11 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?

*Key: God swears by his own life ("As I live") as the most solemn OT oath formula. His stated will is that the wicked LIVE by turning, not that they die. His lack of pleasure in the wicked's death is a sworn declaration.*

---

### Hosea 11:8-9 (God's Heart Turned; Not Executing Fierce Anger; "I Am God and Not Man")
11:8 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.
11:9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger [charon — H2740 + aph — H639], I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man [lo ish]; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

*Key: This is the most direct OT statement linking God's restraint from perpetual fierce anger to his divine nature — "I am God and not man." The contrast: a man might sustain fierce anger indefinitely; God does not. God's holiness does NOT mean he executes "the fierceness of his anger" without end. Note: This applies to Israel specifically; but the character revealed is God's character.*

---

## CLUSTER 4: God's Holiness and the Limits of Wrath

### Isaiah 57:15-16 (The Holy One; "I Will Not Contend for Ever")
57:15 For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
57:16 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.

*Key: God is declared "the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy" — the maximum OT statement of God's transcendence and holiness. Yet in the very same declaration, he immediately states: "I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth." God's holiness does not require perpetual ongoing wrath. The reason given: "the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made" — if God contended forever, the souls he created would be destroyed. This verse specifically connects God's identity as Creator ("souls which I have made") to the limit of his active wrath.*

---

### Habakkuk 1:12-13 (God of Purer Eyes than to Behold Evil)
1:12 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.
1:13 Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth him that is more righteous than he?

*Key: Habakkuk establishes God's holiness as the ground for his complaint — God's eyes are too pure to look at evil, yet he apparently does nothing. The prophetic tension: God's holiness demands action, yet God appears to delay. The answer (chapters 2-3) is that God will judge decisively. God's holiness demands that evil be addressed and removed — not that it be preserved in an ongoing state.*

---

### Nahum 1:2-7 (Jealous and Avenging God; Slow to Anger; Will Not Acquit the Guilty)
1:2 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.
1:3 The LORD is slow to anger [erek appayim], and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: and the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
1:4 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
1:5 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
1:6 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.
1:7 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.

*Key: Nahum holds together multiple divine attributes simultaneously: jealous AND avenging (v.2); slow to anger AND will not acquit the wicked (v.3). His wrath is described as "poured out like fire" — not as a sustained ongoing state but as a consuming event. V.7: "The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble" — the same God who executes judgment is also "good." Both are true simultaneously.*

---

## CLUSTER 5: God's Mercy in Relation to Judgment

### Lamentations 3:22-33 (Mercies Never Cease; Does Not Willingly Afflict)
3:22 It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
3:23 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
3:24 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
3:25 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.
3:26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
3:27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
3:28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.
3:29 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
3:30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.
3:31 For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
3:32 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
3:33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.

*Key: v.33 — "he doth not afflict willingly [lo milib-bo — lit. 'not from his heart/will']" — God's affliction of the children of men is not what he desires or takes pleasure in. This is the Lamentations parallel to Ezk 18:23,32 and 33:11. God's mercy "fails not" (v.22); he "will not cast off for ever" (v.31 — for Israel); but the character revealed is one whose compassions are unfailing and whose heart is not oriented toward affliction.*

---

### 2 Samuel 14:14 (God Devises Means; Not Willing that His Banished Be Expelled)
14:14 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.

*Key: The wise woman of Tekoah's speech to David contains a theological observation: God "devises means" to keep even the banished from permanent expulsion. The statement is: God is not looking for excuses to permanently cut off; he is actively finding ways to restore. The phrase "his banished be not expelled from him" is significant for Study 17: it describes God's character as one oriented toward inclusion rather than permanent exclusion.*

---

### Micah 7:18-19 (Who Is a God Like Thee; Delighteth in Mercy)
7:18 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.
7:19 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.

*Key: v.18 — "he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy." God's character is such that his anger is not perpetual — the reason given is precisely his character: "he delighteth in mercy." This is not universalism; God judges and punishes. But his anger is not his perpetual settled state. The Micah declaration explicitly states God does NOT retain anger forever because his deeper character (delight) is oriented toward mercy.*

## CLUSTER 6: NT Judgment — Righteous, True, and According to Deeds

### Romans 2:2-16 (Judgment According to Truth; No Partiality; According to Deeds)
2:2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
2:3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
2:4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
2:5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
2:6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
2:7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
2:8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
2:9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
2:10 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
2:11 For there is no respect of persons with God.
2:12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish [apollumi] without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
2:13 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
2:16 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.

*Key: v.6 — "render to every man according to his deeds" — the judgment principle is proportionality. v.12 — those who "sinned without law shall perish [apollumi] without law" — destruction vocabulary applied to the outcome. v.4 — "the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance" — God's goodness is oriented toward enabling repentance, not eagerly proceeding to judgment.*

---

### Romans 3:4-6 (God Must Be Just)
3:4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
3:5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
3:6 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

*Key: Paul's argument establishes that God's justice in judgment is necessary for him to judge the world at all. If God were unjust in his judgment, the entire concept of divine judgment would collapse. God's righteousness is the precondition of his role as judge. This means the form of the final judgment must be consistent with God's righteousness.*

---

### 2 Thessalonians 1:4-9 (Righteous Judgment; Repayment; Everlasting Destruction)
1:4 So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:
1:5 Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
1:6 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
1:7 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
1:8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
1:9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction [olethron aionion — G3639 + G166] from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power;

*Key: vv.5-6 — Paul calls the future judgment a "righteous judgment" and a "righteous thing" — an act consistent with God's character of justice. The outcome (v.9) is "everlasting destruction [olethron aionion]" — the noun Paul chooses is olethros (destruction/ruin), not basanismos (torment). The destruction comes "from the presence of the Lord" — God's presence is the source/agent of the destruction (see OT parallels: Ps 9:3; Ps 68:2, established in etc5-06).*

---

### Hebrews 10:30-31 (Vengeance Is Mine; Fearful to Fall into Living God's Hands)
10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
10:31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

*Key: The warning of v.31 underscores the seriousness of God's judgment. "The living God" — judgment belongs to a God who lives and acts. The description is "fearful" — the judgment is to be taken with utmost seriousness. This text supports the gravity of final judgment without specifying its form (destruction vs. torment).*

---

### Revelation 15:3; 16:5-7; 19:2 (True and Righteous Are Thy Judgments)
15:3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.

16:5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.
16:6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
16:7 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

19:2 For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.

*Key: The Revelation judgment doxologies consistently affirm God's judgments as "righteous" (dikaios) and "true" (alethinos). These are the theological evaluation criteria that the redeemed and the angels apply to God's judgments. The form of the judgment is declared consistent with God's character of justice and truth. Notably, Rev 16:5-7 connects the judgment explicitly to proportionality ("thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy") — the punishment fits the crime.*

---

## CLUSTER 7: God's Will Regarding Salvation — Not Willing Any Should Perish

### 1 Timothy 2:3-4 (God Will Have All Men to Be Saved)
2:3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
2:4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

*Key: God's declared will is for all men to be saved. This statement describes God's character of desire and intention — not a guarantee of universal salvation (Scripture elsewhere teaches that not all will be saved), but a statement of what God's character wills. The God who wills all to be saved is the same God who judges those who reject that salvation.*

---

### 2 Peter 3:9 (Not Willing that Any Should Perish)
3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

*Key: "Not willing [ou boulomai] that any should perish" — the verb boulomai describes God's deliberate will/desire. Peter uses "perish" (apollumi) — the destruction vocabulary. God's longsuffering (makrothumia) explains his delay in judgment: he desires that people repent and not perish. When judgment finally comes, it is not because God changed his desire — it is because the opportunity for repentance has been exhausted.*

---

### Matthew 18:14 (Not the Will of Your Father that One Little One Should Perish)
18:14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish [apollumi].

*Key: Jesus states the Father's will: not that "little ones" (those vulnerable, those young in faith) should perish (apollumi). Again the destruction vocabulary: what God does NOT will is their perishing. God's character is defined by the parables that follow (lost sheep, 18:12-13) — he seeks the one who is lost. His will is NOT to lose them.*

---

### Ezekiel 18:23, 32; 33:11 (Repeated Summary)
Already given in Cluster 3. Note: These three verses all use the same Hebrew construction: "Have I any pleasure [hechapots achapots — H2654]" — the root chaphets (H2654) means to take pleasure/delight in. God declares he does NOT take delight in the death of the wicked. The parallel Greek equivalent in the NT is ou thelei (does not will/desire) in 2 Pet 3:9 and Mat 18:14.

---

## CLUSTER 8: Revelation's New Creation — Purposes of Judgment

### Revelation 21:4, 8, 27 (No More Death; Wicked in Lake of Fire; Nothing Defiling)
21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
21:27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.

*Key: The stated purposes of final judgment visible in Rev 21: (1) The new creation has "no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain" (v.4) — these are ABSENT from the new creation, suggesting they have ceased rather than been relocated. (2) The wicked have their part in "the second death" (v.8) — the outcome is named "death," not "torment." (3) "There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth" (v.27) — the purpose of judgment is to secure the holy character of the new creation, not to preserve the wicked in perpetual consciousness.*

---

## CLUSTER 9: Proportionality in Divine Judgment

### Luke 12:47-48 (Many Stripes / Few Stripes — Graduated Punishment)
12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
12:48 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.

*Key: Jesus himself uses graduated punishment language. Greater knowledge = greater responsibility = greater punishment. Smaller knowledge = smaller punishment. ECT requires every lost person to suffer the same eternal fate regardless of degree of knowledge or guilt — this creates tension with the Luke 12:47-48 principle of proportional punishment. The graduated punishment principle appears in both OT and NT (LUK 20:47 — greater damnation; MAT 11:22 — more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon).*

---

### Psalm 103:6-14 (God's Mercy and Justice; He Knows Our Frame)
103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness [tsedaqah — H6666] and judgment [mishpat — H4941] for all that are oppressed.
103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious [rachum v'channun], slow to anger [erek appayim], and plenteous in mercy [hesed].
103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy [hesed] toward them that fear him.
103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

*Key: Psalm 103 holds God's justice (v.6) and mercy (v.8) together within the same poem. v.10 — God has NOT dealt with us "after our sins" or "according to our iniquities" — strict retributive justice would produce a worse outcome than what God actually does, even in judgment. v.14 — "he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust" — God's knowledge of human frailty and mortality is a factor in his merciful judgment. This connects to etc5-01's findings about human mortality.*

---

### Isaiah 61:8 (I the LORD Love Judgment)
61:8 For I the LORD love judgment [mishpat — H4941], I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.

*Key: God identifies himself as one who "loves judgment" — mishpat (right verdict, justice). God's love of judgment is in the context of righting wrongs and establishing equity. This affirms that judgment itself is consistent with God's character — but it is judgment in the sense of establishing what is right, not in the sense of cruelty or excess.*

---

## CLUSTER 10: God's Holiness as Background to Judgment

### Isaiah 6:1-5 (Holy, Holy, Holy)
6:1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
6:2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
6:3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
6:4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
6:5 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

*Key: The triple "holy" (qadosh — H6918) is the pinnacle OT statement of God's holiness. Isaiah's response (v.5) illustrates what holiness demands: awareness of uncleanness and the impossibility of mere sinful humanity standing before it. God's holiness is not arbitrary — it is the absolute ethical purity that cannot coexist with sin. The judgment question: does holiness demand perpetual conscious torment of the wicked, or their complete removal/destruction?*

---

### Revelation 4:8 (Holy, Holy, Holy — NT Echo)
4:8 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.

*Key: The Isaiah 6 trisagion is echoed in Revelation's throne vision. God's holiness is declared in the final book of the canon as consistently as in the first great prophetic vision. The "Lord God Almighty" who is holy is also the one whose judgments are declared "righteous" (Rev 16:5,7) and "true" (Rev 15:3; 19:2).*

---

## CLUSTER 11: NT Summary — God's Love and Final Judgment Together

### John 3:16-19 (God So Loved; That He Might Be Saved; The World Judged)
3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish [apollumi], but have everlasting life.
3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
3:19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

*Key: v.16 — God's love motivates the provision of salvation from perishing (apollumi). v.17 — God's purpose was salvation, not condemnation. v.18-19 — condemnation comes upon those who reject the light. The pattern: God's love provides salvation from perishing; those who reject it remain under judgment. God does not condemn eagerly; condemnation is the result of rejection of the offered light.*

---

### 1 John 4:8, 16 (God Is Love)
4:8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
4:16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

*Key: The NT's most concentrated statement of God's essential character: "God is love" (twice in same chapter). This is not merely that God has love as an attribute, but that love is constitutive of his being. Any account of God's final judgment of the wicked must be evaluated against this fundamental character statement. Does ECT or does annihilation better fit a God whose essential being is love?*

---

### Romans 9:22-23 (Vessels of Wrath; Vessels of Mercy — God's Patience)
9:22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction [apoleia — G684]:
9:23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory.

*Key: v.22 — even toward "vessels of wrath fitted to destruction," God exercised "much longsuffering." God's patience even toward those destined for judgment reflects his character. The outcome named is "destruction [apoleia]" not "torment." The contrast (v.23) is "riches of glory" for the vessels of mercy — two different outcomes for two groups.*
