## EZK 18:23 — Concept Context

Result: **"No theological concepts found in EZK 18:23"**

The concept_context.py tool did not identify any of its registered theological concept tags in the verse text. The verse reads: "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?"

Note: The verse's key terms (pleasure/desire toward death of wicked; return/repentance; live) do not match the tool's concept-tag vocabulary. The theological content is captured instead in the Nave's entry (GOD, MERCY OF: includes EZK 18:23,31,32) and in the cross-testament parallel data above.

## 2PE 3:9 — Concept Context

Source verse: "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."

Concepts identified: PROMISE (G1860), REPENTANCE (G3341)

### Same Chapter (2 Peter 3) — Matches
1. 2 Peter 3:13 [PROMISE] — "Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."

Note: The tool's concept-context for 2 Pet 3:9 did not find any book-level verses combining both PROMISE and REPENTANCE. The verse's most distinctive concept (God NOT willing that ANY should perish) is not matched — the tool does not have a concept tag for "perish" (apollumi) in this context.

## PSA 145:20 — Concept Context

Source verse: "The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy."

Concepts identified: LOVE (H157 — "them that love him")

### Same Chapter (Psalm 145) — Match
1. Psalms 145:8 [LOVE] — "The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy."

### Same Book (Psalm) — Top Matches (via LOVE concept)
1. Psalms 100:5 [LOVE] — "For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations."
2. Psalms 101:1 [LOVE] — "I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing."
3. Psalms 103:11 [LOVE] — "For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him."
4. Psalms 103:13 [LOVE] — "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him."
5. Psalms 103:17 [LOVE] — "But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children."
6. Psalms 103:4 [LOVE] — "Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies."
7. Psalms 103:8 [LOVE] — "The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy."

Note: Psalm 145:20's antithesis (love → preservation vs. wicked → destruction) connects to the broader Psalms context of love/mercy vs. judgment. Psalm 101:1 is particularly notable: "I will sing of mercy and judgment" — the two attributes held together. Psalm 103:4 connects directly to the study question: God "redeemeth thy life from destruction."
