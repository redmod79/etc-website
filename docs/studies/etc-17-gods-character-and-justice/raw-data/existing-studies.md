# Prior ETC5 Study Summaries — etc5-17: God's Character and Justice

## Purpose: Carry forward key findings from CONCLUSION.md files read during research

## etc5-01: What Is Man (Human Constitution)

**Key Findings:**
- Man is mortal by nature; God alone possesses immortality (athanasia) as an inherent attribute (E29, N5; 1 Tim 6:16)
- The soul (nephesh/psyche) can die — Ezk 18:4; Rev 16:3 (E24, N7)
- God can destroy both soul and body in gehenna (Mat 10:28; E26, N8)
- The creation formula (dust + breath = living soul) is reversible; at death it IS reversed (N4)
- The soul that sinneth, it SHALL die (Ezk 18:4, 20; E24) — direct statement
- I15 (inherent immortal soul) classified I-D: contradicts E/N evidence; held only by adding concepts not in any E/N statement
- Evidence total after etc5-01: 88 items (60 E + 12 N + 16 I)

**Relevance to Study 17:** These facts constrain what any final-fate doctrine may claim about God's action in judgment. ECT requires God to actively sustain human consciousness indefinitely in a state of torment — this is an act God performs, not something inherent to human nature. Annihilation requires God to complete what death began (or simply permit the wages of sin to take full effect without superimposing artificial preservation).

## etc5-06: Destruction Vocabulary

**Key Findings:**
- OT destruction vocabulary (abad, shamad, kalah, karat, ain) consistently denotes cessation, non-existence, and complete ruin throughout Hebrew Bible
- LXX bridge: abad → apollumi (PMI 6.14, 141x); shamad → apollumi (PMI 4.53, 23x) — the NT uses the LXX's established vocabulary for OT destruction concepts
- NT destruction vocabulary (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora) structurally placed as direct antithesis of life (zoe) in every eschatological text where they appear together (N030)
- Torment vocabulary (basanismos, basanizo) is lexically distinct from destruction vocabulary — the two sets never appear together in the same judgment description for the same subject (N033)
- Basanismos (G929) appears exclusively in Revelation (6 occurrences); eschatological basanizo confined to Revelation
- Paul's consistent eschatological noun = olethros (destruction), never basanismos (E210)
- Nave's labels eschatological fire under "DESTRUCTION of the wicked" (not "TORMENT of the wicked") (E286)
- Evidence total after etc5-06: 252 items (184 E + 33 N + 35 I)

**Key Evidence Items:**
- E116: "Everlasting destruction [olethron aionion] from the presence of the Lord" (2 Th 1:9)
- E164: "Whose end [telos] is destruction [apoleia]" (Phil 3:19)
- E165: "Wide is the gate... that leadeth to destruction [apoleia]... narrow... unto life [zoe]" (Mat 7:13-14)
- N030: Apollumi/apoleia structurally paired as antithesis of life (zoe) in four independent NT texts
- N033: Torment and destruction vocabulary are lexically distinct, never co-applied to same subject
- IA020: "Everlasting destruction" (2 Th 1:9) — aionion modifies permanence of result, not duration of process

## etc5-15: The Strongest ECT Case

**Key Findings:**
- Three ECT texts contain E-tier ECT-direction facts:
  - Rev 14:9-11 (E150 — human beast-worshippers explicitly tormented; smoke for ever)
  - Rev 20:10 (E149 — three named supernatural entities explicitly tormented for ever)
  - Luke 16:23-24 (E123 — rich man explicitly in torments in Hades)
- Zero ECT arguments reach the N tier for the doctrine that ALL human wicked suffer ongoing conscious torment forever
- All 8 strongest ECT arguments assessed at I-B; resolutions:
  - IB009 (STRONG — toward permanent desolation): governs Rev 14:9-11 smoke formula and Mark 9/Isa 66:24
  - IB015 (Moderate — toward permanent/irrevocable judgment): governs Rev 20:10 for three supernatural entities
  - IB016 (Moderate — AGAINST universal extension): governs Mat 25:41 same-fire argument
  - IB012 (Moderate — toward referent-nature): governs Mat 25:46 same-adjective argument
  - IB011 (Moderate — toward referent-nature): governs Dan 12:2 grammatical symmetry
  - IB014 (Moderate — toward judgment-process): governs "no rest day nor night" in Rev 14:11
  - IB008 (Moderate — AGAINST universal extension): governs scope of Rev 14/20 torment language
  - IB006 (Moderate — toward parabolic): governs Luke 16
- New E items: E282 (present-tense morphology of Mrk 9:48 verbs; source text = pigrê = corpses); E283 (dir'on in Isa 66:24 = attitude of observers toward corpses, not experience of the condemned)
- Evidence total after etc5-15: 376 items (283 E + 46 N + 47 I)
- ECT evidence count: E: 7 items; N: 0 items; I-A: 0 items

**Relevance to Study 17:** Study 17 focuses on God's character as the criterion for evaluating ECT vs. annihilation. The zero-N-tier finding is critical: no ECT argument produces a necessary implication. Every ECT argument requires an interpretation step. This means the biblical evidence for ECT is entirely at the inference level when applied to the doctrine that ALL human wicked suffer perpetual conscious torment.

## etc5-16: Origins of ECT

**Key Findings:**
- G5020 (tartaroo) = 1 NT occurrence (2 Pet 2:4), applied ONLY to fallen angels, pre-judgment, characterized by "chains of darkness" — not the final eschatological fate of human persons
- G2851 (kolasis = "everlasting punishment" in Matt 25:46) derives from kolazo = to prune/curtail — root etymology emphasizes curtailment/restriction, not ongoing torture (E288)
- G929 (basanismos = torment noun) appears exclusively in Revelation (6 occurrences, E172)
- G622 (apollumi = destroy fully/perish) = 92 NT occurrences throughout NT
- Nave's TORMENTS entry cites only 2 passage clusters: Luke 16:23-28 and Rev 14:10-11 (E285)
- Nave's FIRE entry places eschatological fire under "DESTRUCTION of the wicked" (E286)
- IA026: Torment vocabulary (G929 basanismos, G928 basanizo = 18 NT occurrences) confined to Revelation; destruction vocabulary (G622 apollumi + G3639 olethros = 96+ NT occurrences) appears throughout NT didactic teaching
- IC003: Peter's single use of tartaroo (mythological underworld term) is restricted to pre-judgment fallen angel confinement — not applied to human eschatological fate
- Evidence total after etc5-16: 383 items (288 E + 46 N + 49 I)
  - Distribution: Conditionalist 171, ECT 10, Neutral 185 (not a vote count; reflects textual emphasis patterns)
- I-B items: 2 RESOLVED STRONG (IB009, IB013); 14 Moderate; 1 Unresolved (IB004)

**Next Evidence IDs entering Study 17:** E289+, N047+, IA027+, IB018+, IC004+, ID004+

**Relevance to Study 17:** The vocabulary patterns documented in etc5-06 and confirmed in etc5-16 show that wherever the NT writers address the fate of the wicked in didactic (non-apocalyptic) teaching — epistles, Gospels, Synoptic parables — they use destruction vocabulary (apollumi, olethros, apoleia) not torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos). This distributional fact is directly relevant to whether God's character as revealed in the epistles and Gospels points toward ECT or annihilation.

## Evidence Item Cross-Reference for Study 17

These existing items are directly relevant to the God's-character question:

| Master ID | Statement | Relevance to Study 17 |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| E26 | God can destroy [apolesai] both soul and body in gehenna | God's power to destroy completely — ECT requires active sustaining of life, not destruction |
| E116 | "Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord" (2 Th 1:9) | God's judgment described as destruction, not ongoing torment |
| N5 | God alone possesses immortality (athanasia) as inherent attribute | ECT requires God to grant/maintain immortality in the condemned |
| N8 | God can destroy both soul and body (Mat 10:28) | Capability of complete destruction is stated, not just punishment |
| N029 *(reclassified to IB009-resolved after Study 5)* | "Eternal fire" = permanent result (Sodom → ashes per Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6) | Aionios fire produces permanent results, not necessarily eternal process |
| N030 | Apollumi/apoleia paired as antithesis of life (zoe) in four independent texts | The biblical contrast is life vs. destruction, not life vs. torment |
| N033 | Torment and destruction vocabulary lexically distinct, never co-applied | The two categories describe different outcomes |
| N034 | Duration of olam/aionios determined by referent's nature | "Everlasting punishment" duration determined by referent (kolasis) |
| IA026 | Torment vocabulary confined to Revelation; destruction vocabulary throughout NT didactic | Genre distribution correlates with the two vocabulary sets |
| IB009 | Smoke-for-ever formula = permanent desolation idiom (RESOLVED STRONG) | The key ECT smoke-formula has Strong resolution against literal perpetual conscious experience |
| E149 | Devil/beast/false prophet tormented for ever (Rev 20:10) | ECT E-tier fact limited to three named supernatural entities |
| E150 | Beast-worshippers tormented; smoke ascending for ever (Rev 14:10-11) | ECT E-tier fact limited to those with the mark of the beast |
| E123 | Rich man in Hades explicitly in torments (Luk 16:23-24) | ECT E-tier fact in intermediate-state (pre-judgment) context |
