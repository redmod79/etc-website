# God's Character and Justice — Final Fate of the Wicked
## CONCLUSION — etc5-17
## Series: ETC5 — The Final Fate of the Wicked (Study 17 of 18)
## Date: 2026-02-19

## Question

What does Scripture reveal about God's character — his love, justice, holiness, mercy, and wrath — and how does that character bear on the question of the final fate of the wicked? Is eternal conscious torment (ECT) or annihilation/destruction more consistent with who God is revealed to be? What biblical passages speak to God's purposes in judgment?

---

## Summary Answer

Scripture describes God's character through multiple named attributes that bear directly on the final fate question. Five independent passages explicitly state that God does NOT will, take pleasure in, or desire the death/perishing (apollumi) of the wicked — using the vocabulary the conditionalist position associates with the final fate (Ezk 18:23,32; 33:11; 2 Pet 3:9; Mat 18:14). Multiple passages explicitly state that God's anger is not perpetual: the Holy One who inhabits eternity "will not contend for ever" (Isa 57:16); God "retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy" (Mic 7:18); God "doth not afflict willingly" (Lam 3:33). God's holiness is a genuine datum that demands sin be addressed, but every biblical judgment doxology declares God's judgments "righteous" and "true" in the context of destruction events, not perpetual torment. The character evidence produces a Moderate I-B resolution in favor of the conditionalist position (IB018), while the ECT position's character arguments from holiness establish that sin must be addressed without specifying that its form must be eternal conscious torment.

## Key Biblical Evidence

### Established Evidence Referenced (from prior studies)

The following master evidence items are referenced by this study:

**Core destruction vocabulary (from etc5-06):**
- E114 (Conditionalist): Jhn 3:16 — "should not perish [apollumi], but have everlasting life"
- E116 (Conditionalist): 2 Th 1:9 — "everlasting destruction [olethron aionion] from the presence of the Lord"
- E275 (Conditionalist): Rom 2:12 — Paul's summary word for fate of sinners = apollumi (perish)
- N032 (Conditionalist): Destruction vocabulary consistently describes cessation, not torment, across both testaments
- IA026 (Conditionalist): Torment vocabulary confined to Revelation apocalyptic; destruction vocabulary throughout NT didactic teaching

**ECT explicit evidence (from etc5-05; all reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit):**
- E149 (Neutral, reclassified etc5-18): Rev 20:10 — devil/beast/false prophet tormented day and night for ever and ever
- E150 (Neutral, reclassified etc5-18): Rev 14:10-11 — beast-worshippers tormented; smoke ascending for ever and ever
- E123 (Neutral, reclassified etc5-18): Luk 16:23-24 — rich man in torment in hades

**Judgment vocabulary (from etc5-08 and etc5-14):**
- E208 (Neutral): Mat 25:46 — same adjective aionion for both punishment and life
- E209 (Neutral): Kolasis (G2851) in Mat 25:46 = "penal infliction," NOT basanismos (torment)
- E210 (Neutral): Paul's consistent eschatological noun is olethros (destruction), never basanismos
- N034 (Neutral): Olam/aionios duration determined by nature of referent

**Prior character-related evidence (from etc5-03):**
- E106 (Neutral): Ezk 18:23 — "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?"
- E107 (Neutral): Ezk 18:32 — "I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth"
  [Both now also in: etc5-17]

**IB resolutions established from prior studies:**

First Appeared: etc5-17

**E292** | Neutral | Isa 61:8
"For I the LORD love judgment [mishpat]." God identifies loving judgment (right verdict) as an attribute of his character.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E293** | Neutral | Rev 15:3; 16:5-7; 19:2
The Revelation judgment doxologies: redeemed and angels declare God's judgments "righteous" (dikaios) and "true" (alethinos). Rev 16:6 adds explicit proportionality rationale: "thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy."
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E294** | Neutral | Rom 2:2
"The judgment of God is according to truth [aletheia] against them which commit such things." God's judgment is characterized as "according to truth."
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E295** | Neutral | Rom 2:4
"The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance." God's goodness is oriented toward enabling repentance rather than proceeding eagerly to judgment.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**God's Love and Mercy:**

**E296** | Neutral | Exo 34:6-7
"The LORD, The LORD God, merciful [rachum] and gracious [channun], longsuffering [erek appayim], and abundant in goodness [hesed] and truth [emet]... Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity... and that will by no means clear the guilty." God's own self-declaration of character — simultaneously merciful and just. The foundational OT character formula, echoed throughout the OT.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E297** | Conditionalist | Ezk 33:11
"As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live." God swears by his own life (most solemn OT oath formula) that he has no pleasure in the death of the wicked; his stated will is that the wicked live by turning.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E298** | Conditionalist | Hos 11:8-9
"I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger [charon], I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man [lo ish]; the Holy One in the midst of thee." God explicitly restrains fierce perpetual anger, invoking his divine nature ("I am God and not man") and his holiness as the reason for restraint.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E299** | Conditionalist | Isa 57:15-16
"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy... For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made." The Holy One who inhabits eternity explicitly states he will not contend perpetually; the reason given is that perpetual divine contention would destroy the souls he made.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E300** | Conditionalist | Lam 3:33
"For he doth not afflict willingly [lo milib-bo — not from his heart/inner being] nor grieve the children of men." God's affliction of humanity is explicitly stated as not arising from his inner will or desire.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E301** | Conditionalist | Mic 7:18
"He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy." God explicitly does not retain his anger perpetually; the reason given is his character — he delights in mercy.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E302** | Conditionalist | 2 Pet 3:9
"The Lord is not slack... but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing [ou boulomai] that any should perish [apollumi], but that all should come to repentance." God's deliberate will/desire (boulomai) is explicitly stated: he does not will the apollumi (perishing/destruction) of any. The destruction vocabulary (apollumi) appears as the outcome God does not desire.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E303** | Conditionalist | Mat 18:14
"Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish [apollumi]." The Father's will is explicitly stated: not that the little ones perish (apollumi).
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E304** | Neutral | 1 Jn 4:8, 16
"God is love" — stated twice. The predicate nominative statement that love (agape) is constitutive of God's being.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E305** | Neutral | Jhn 3:17
"For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved." God's stated purpose in the Incarnation is salvation, not condemnation.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**God's Holiness:**

**E306** | Neutral | Isa 6:3, 5
"Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory." Isaiah's response: "I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips." The supreme OT triple-holiness declaration with its associated human response of awe and awareness of uncleanness.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E307** | Neutral | Hab 1:12-13
"Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity." God's holiness is described as absolute ethical purity that cannot tolerate sin — it demands that sin be addressed.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E308** | Neutral | Nah 1:2-7
God is simultaneously jealous and avenging (v.2), slow to anger (v.3), will not acquit the wicked (v.3), fury poured out like fire (v.6), and good (v.7). Multiple character attributes — including wrath and goodness — held together in the same passage.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E309** | Neutral | Rev 4:8
"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come." NT echo of the Isaiah 6 trisagion, confirming God's holiness in the final canonical witness.

---

**God's Longsuffering and Wrath:**

**E310** | Conditionalist | Rom 9:22
"What if God, willing to shew his wrath... endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction [apoleia]." Longsuffering is specifically extended toward those whose outcome is named as apoleia (destruction), not basanismos (torment). The destruction vocabulary is used for the final fate of those who were objects of God's longsuffering.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**God's Justice — Proportionality:**

**E311** | Conditionalist | Luk 12:47-48
"That servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself... shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not... shall be beaten with few stripes." Jesus explicitly teaches graduated punishment — severity is proportional to degree of knowledge and responsibility.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**E312** | Conditionalist | Psa 103:10, 14
"He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities... he remembereth that we are dust." God's character includes a restraint relative to strict retributive punishment; he knowingly does not apply the full weight of what sins deserve.
First Appeared: etc5-17

#### N-Tier (Necessary Implication) — New Items

After applying the stricter three-test N-tier methodology, no new N items are added from this study. The reason: the key observations of this study (God does not take pleasure in death of wicked; God will not contend forever; God's anger is not perpetual; God's goodness leads to repentance) are all E-tier explicit statements about God's character. The implication that "therefore the final punishment is annihilation rather than ECT" requires an interpretive step — what the character attribute "demands" or "allows" — which fails the universal-agreement test (ECT scholars dispute these inferences). Necessary implications from this study would require all three N-tier tests to pass; none of the character-to-outcome inferences pass the universal agreement test.

---

#### I-Tier (Inferences) — New Items

**I-A (Evidence-Extending):**

**IA027** | Conditionalist | Luk 12:47-48; Ezk 18:20-30; Rom 2:6
The proportional punishment principle — explicitly taught by Jesus (E311: many vs. few stripes based on knowledge) and embedded in the Ezk 18 proportional accountability framework — is extended to eschatological final punishment. If punishment is graduated based on degree of knowledge and responsibility, a doctrine of uniform infinite eternal torment for every unsaved person regardless of degree of guilt is not consistent with the stated proportionality principle. The conditionalist position — that destruction is the outcome, with varying degrees of experience possible before the final destruction — is more compatible with proportional punishment than ECT's uniform infinite torment.
**Basis:** E311 (Luk 12:47-48: many/few stripes explicitly graduated); E293 (Rev 16:6: "worthy" = proportional judgment vocabulary in Rev); E290 (Deut 32:4: "his work is perfect" — no excess); Rom 2:6 (render to every man according to his deeds = proportionality principle, established in prior studies); the extension to eschatological final punishment is the inference step (criterion #5 systematizing + #4a SIS: Jesus's own teaching on graduated punishment governs the inference).
First Appeared: etc5-17

**IA028** | Conditionalist | Ezk 18:23, 32; 33:11; 2 Pet 3:9; Mat 18:14; Lam 3:33; Mic 7:18; Hos 11:8-9; Isa 57:15-16
The pattern of statements about what God does NOT will/take pleasure in (death/apollumi of the wicked), combined with the pattern of statements about the non-perpetuity of his anger, constitutes a coherent biblical portrait of God's character that is more consistent with annihilation (a finite destruction that God does not delight in but executes in judgment) than with ECT (an infinite perpetual torment that God actively maintains forever, with anger never relenting). The individual statements are E-tier; the systematic inference from the pattern is I-A.
**Basis:** E297, E106, E107 (no pleasure in death of wicked); E302, E303 (not willing apollumi); E300, E301, E298, E299 (anger non-perpetual); the systematization into a "more consistent with" claim is criterion #5.
First Appeared: etc5-17

**I-B (Competing-Evidence):**

**IB018** | Neutral | Multiple character passages
**Claim:** The character of God as revealed in Scripture — his love, justice, holiness, mercy, wrath, and longsuffering — is more consistent with annihilation/destruction as the final fate of the wicked than with ECT.

**What the Bible actually says:**
- FOR (conditionalist direction): E297 (Ezk 33:11 — sworn: no pleasure in wicked's death); E106 (Ezk 18:23 — no pleasure in death); E107 (Ezk 18:32 — no pleasure in death); E302 (2 Pet 3:9 — not willing apollumi of any); E303 (Mat 18:14 — not Father's will that little ones perish/apollumi); E298 (Hos 11:8-9 — God restrains fierce anger; "I am God not man"); E299 (Isa 57:15-16 — Holy One will not contend forever; souls would fail); E301 (Mic 7:18 — retaineth not anger forever; delighteth in mercy); E300 (Lam 3:33 — does not afflict willingly); E311 (Luk 12:47-48 — graduated punishment principle from Jesus); E310 (Rom 9:22 — longsuffering even toward vessels of wrath/apoleia); N032 (destruction vocabulary = cessation); IA026 (destruction vocabulary throughout didactic NT teaching)
- AGAINST / FOR ECT direction: E306 (Isa 6:3,5 — absolute holiness); E307 (Hab 1:12-13 — purer eyes than to behold evil; holiness demands sin be addressed); E149 (Rev 20:10 — three entities tormented forever; reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit); E150 (Rev 14:10-11 — beast-worshippers tormented; reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit); E123 (Luk 16:23-24 — rich man in torment; reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit); E277 (Heb 10:31 — fearful to fall into God's hands); IB015 (for-ever formula on active torment verb for three named entities)

**Why this is an inference:** No verse states "God's character requires the final punishment to be annihilation" or "God's character requires the final punishment to be ECT." Both claims require the additional step of inferring what God's character "demands" for the form of final punishment. Competent scholars on both sides dispute these inferences.

**Criteria:** #2 (choosing between two interpretive frameworks for what character attributes require/allow); #5 (systematizing character evidence into a positional claim)

**I-B SIS Resolution Protocol:**

*Step 1 — Tension:* Stated above. Nine conditionalist-direction character items (Plain or Contextually Clear) vs. two holiness items that establish sin must be addressed (Plain) plus ECT explicit items for specific subjects.

*Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:*
- E297 (Ezk 33:11): Plain — God swears by his own life using the most solemn OT formula; content directly states no pleasure in wicked's death
- E106, E107 (Ezk 18:23,32): Plain — direct declarative statements, unambiguous
- E302 (2 Pet 3:9): Plain — deliberate will vocabulary (boulomai) + apollumi
- E303 (Mat 18:14): Plain — didactic statement of the Father's will
- E300 (Lam 3:33): Plain — direct statement of internal orientation
- E301 (Mic 7:18): Plain — explicit character statement with explicit reason
- E311 (Luk 12:47-48): Plain — didactic teaching from Jesus, graduated punishment principle
- E298 (Hos 11:8-9): Contextually Clear — direct statement but Israel-specific context
- E299 (Isa 57:15-16): Contextually Clear — direct statement; character is fully stated
- E306 (Isa 6:3,5): Plain — establishes holiness demands that sin be addressed
- E307 (Hab 1:12-13): Plain — establishes holiness as absolute ethical intolerance of evil
- E277 (Heb 10:31): Contextually Clear — establishes severity without specifying form
- E149 (Rev 20:10): Plain — explicitly names three entities as tormented for ever
- E150 (Rev 14:10-11): Contextually Clear — torment language + smoke formula; formula resolved as permanent-desolation by IB009 (STRONG)

*Step 3 — Weight:*
FOR conditionalist: 7 Plain + 2 Contextually Clear items directly addressing what God does NOT will/desire and the non-perpetuity of his anger. These items directly address the form-question: they say God does not delight in the "death" (Ezk) and "apollumi" (2 Pet; Mat) of the wicked — the conditionalist vocabulary for the final fate.
FOR ECT: 2 Plain holiness items (establish that sin must be addressed, but compatible with complete destruction); 1 Contextually Clear item (E150, reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit, addressed by IB009 Strong); 1 Plain item (E149, reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit, for three named supernatural entities — scope extension to all humans requires IB008 Moderate AGAINST).

*Step 4 — SIS Application:*
The clearest items directly addressing the form-question are the conditionalist-direction items: they state explicitly what God does NOT will (apollumi) and that his wrath is not perpetual. The holiness items (E306, E307) establish that sin must be addressed but are equally compatible with complete destruction as with ongoing torment — they do not discriminate between the two forms. The ECT explicit items (E149, E150) apply to specific named entities; extension to all humans fails IB008 (Moderate AGAINST). The clear items (Plain conditionalist character statements) interpret the ambiguous question (which form of punishment does holiness demand?) by showing that holiness is satisfied by complete removal of evil, which is what the OT destruction vocabulary consistently describes (N032).

*Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate — weight toward conditionalist character argument.*
Not Strong because: (a) God's holiness (E306, E307) is a genuinely weighty datum that prevents a strong resolution — both positions must account for it; (b) ECT proponents make a valid argument that infinite holiness warrants infinite punishment, and the conditionalist response (complete destruction satisfies holiness) is itself an I-A inference; (c) the specific ECT entities (E149 for three supernatural beings) remain Plain at the E tier. The Moderate resolution reflects that the preponderance of explicit character evidence (7+ Plain items) lines up with the conditionalist direction, while the ECT character argument has genuine weight but rests on character-to-outcome inferences that the clearest texts do not make explicit.

## Positional Assessment

The character-of-God evidence from Study 17 contributes the following to the series:

**New conditionalist explicit items (10):** Five passages state God does NOT will/take pleasure in the wicked's death (using "death" vocabulary) or their apollumi (using destruction vocabulary). Four passages state God's wrath is non-perpetual as a character attribute. One passage (Jesus himself) teaches graduated proportional punishment.

**New neutral explicit items (14):** Fourteen items establish God's character attributes (righteousness of all his ways, love of judgment, holiness, his self-declaration) as facts both sides must acknowledge.

**New conditionalist inferences (2 I-A):** IA027 extends the proportionality principle to eschatological punishment (consistent with conditionalism, creates tension with ECT's uniform infinite torment). IA028 systematizes the non-desire and non-perpetual-wrath pattern into a coherent character portrait.

**New I-B tension (IB018):** The God's-character-and-final-fate inference is classified as I-B with a Moderate conditionalist resolution. Neither position's character inference reaches the N tier.

The character evidence does not stand alone — it must be read alongside the vocabulary evidence (destruction vs. torment vocabulary across both testaments, established in etc5-06), the immortality evidence (God alone has immortality; mortals must put on immortality at resurrection, established in etc5-01 and etc5-02), and the strongest-ECT-case assessment (zero ECT arguments reach N tier for the universal claim about all human wicked, established in etc5-15).

---

## Series Coverage

Studies 1–17 of 18 complete.

## Connection to Prior Studies

- **etc5-01 (What Is Man):** Man is mortal; God alone has immortality (E29, N5). What "death" means for humans provides the interpretive context for the "wages of sin is death" (E072) and the destruction vocabulary.
- **etc5-06 (Destruction Vocabulary):** The OT and NT destruction vocabulary (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, abad, shamad, kalah) consistently denotes cessation/ruin — not torment. The conditionalist character evidence (God does not will apollumi; does not take pleasure in death) uses the same destruction vocabulary as the established final-fate language.
- **etc5-15 (Strongest ECT Case):** Zero ECT arguments reach N tier for the universal claim about all human wicked. All 8 ECT text arguments remain I-B. This baseline means the ECT character inference (holiness demands infinite punishment) has no E or N tier support for the universal ECT claim.
- **etc5-16 (Origins of ECT):** Nave's organizes punishment of the wicked under "PUNISHMENT OF" not "TORMENT OF"; eschatological fire under "DESTRUCTION of the wicked" (E286). Kolasis derives from root meaning curtailment/pruning, not torture (E288).

- God's holiness is absolute — "holy, holy, holy" — and demands that sin be addressed (Isa 6:3,5 — E306; Hab 1:12-13 — E307)

## What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied)

- "God's love requires that punishment be remedial/finite" — this is I-B, not stated
- "God's holiness requires infinite eternal conscious torment" — this is I-B, not stated
- "The graduated punishment principle (Luk 12:47-48) proves ECT is impossible" — this is I-A, not N
- "God's non-desire for apollumi proves the wicked will not perish" — this is self-contradictory; God does not desire it but it follows from rejection of repentance
- "God's character requires universalism" — Scripture explicitly states judgment falls on the impenitent
- "The character argument decides the ECT vs. annihilation question definitively" — this is I-B (competing evidence on both sides), not E or N
