2. **Biblical proportionality principle** -- Luke 12:47-48 (degrees of punishment); Matt 10:15, 11:22 (more tolerable); Heb 2:2-3 (just recompense)
3. **Historical punishment patterns** -- Every recorded divine judgment: result = death/destruction, NOT eternal torment (flood, Sodom, Korah, Nadab/Abihu)
4. **"According to deeds" passages** -- Rom 2:5-6; 2 Cor 5:10; Col 3:25; Ezek 7:3,27; Job 34:11; Ps 62:12
5. **God's stated desire** -- Not willing any perish (2 Pet 3:9); no pleasure in death of wicked (Ezek 18:23,32; 33:11)
6. **Death as the stated penalty** -- Rom 6:23; Ezek 18:4,20; Gen 2:17; James 1:15
7. **Consistency test** -- Does infinite torment for finite sin match the "according to deeds" principle? Does destruction?
