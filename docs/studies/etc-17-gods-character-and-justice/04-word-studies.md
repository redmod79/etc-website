# Word Studies: God's Character and Justice

## 1. G2851 -- kolasis (punishment)
- **Definition:** penal infliction; punishment, torment
- **NT occurrences:** 2 (Matt 25:46; 1 John 4:18)
- **LXX occurrence:** Ezekiel 14:3 (obstacle/stumbling block -- slightly different nuance)
- **Note:** Aristotle distinguished kolasis (corrective punishment aimed at the sufferer's benefit) from timoria (retributive punishment aimed at the satisfaction of the punisher). Matt 25:46 uses kolasis, not timoria. If Aristotle's distinction holds, the word choice suggests corrective/remedial intent -- but the eschatological context may override the classical distinction.

## 2. G5098 -- timoria (punishment, penalty)
- **Definition:** vindication, penalty; punishment
- **NT occurrences:** 1 (Heb 10:29 -- "sorer punishment")
- **Note:** The word in Heb 10:29 is timoria, not kolasis. The author of Hebrews uses the retributive punishment word in the context of a "how much more" (proportionality) argument. The comparison is between dying without mercy (Mosaic law) and "sorer punishment" -- establishing degrees.

## 3. H4941 -- mishpat (judgment, justice, ordinance)
- **Definition:** verdict (favorable or unfavorable), sentence, right, ordinance, manner
- **OT occurrences:** ~448
- **Translation patterns:** judgment (69x), my judgments (23x), of judgment (21x), right (7x), manner (12x)
- **Key verses:** Deut 32:4 ("all his ways are judgment"); Ps 89:14 ("justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne"); Isa 28:17 ("judgment also will I lay to the line")
- **Significance:** God's character IS mishpat. His actions are defined by this word. Every judgment He executes is subject to this standard.

## 4. G1656 -- eleos (mercy, compassion)
- **Definition:** compassion, mercy (human or divine)
- **NT occurrences:** 24 (mercy 20x, have mercy 1x)
- **Key verses:** James 2:13 ("mercy rejoiceth against judgment"); Luke 1:50 ("his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation"); Rom 9:23 ("vessels of mercy")
- **LXX connection:** Translates H2617 (chesed) regularly

## 5. H2617 -- chesed (lovingkindness, mercy, steadfast love)
- **Definition:** goodness, kindness, faithfulness, mercy
- **OT occurrences:** ~252
- **Translation patterns:** mercy (45x "his mercy"), kindness (24x), lovingkindness (11x)
- **Key verses:** Exo 34:6 ("abundant in goodness/chesed"); Ps 103:8 ("plenteous in mercy/chesed"); Ps 136 (26 times: "his mercy endureth for ever"); Mic 7:18 ("delighteth in mercy/chesed")
- **Significance:** This is the most frequent word used to describe God's character in the OT. It appears 252 times. The ratio of chesed to any torment vocabulary applied to human wicked is overwhelming.

## 6. G3405 -- misthapodosia (recompense of reward)
- **Definition:** requital (good or bad); recompense
- **NT occurrences:** 3 (Heb 2:2; 10:35; 11:26)
- **Key verse:** Heb 2:2 -- "every transgression and disobedience received a just [endikos] recompence of reward [misthapodosia]"
- **Significance:** The word "just" (endikos, G1738) modifies the recompense. Biblical punishment is explicitly described as "just" -- proportionate to the offense.

## 7. G3408 -- misthos (wages, reward, hire)
- **Definition:** pay for service; reward
- **NT occurrences:** 26 (reward 19x, hire 2x, wages 1x)
- **Key connection:** The concept of "wages" (opsonia G3800 in Rom 6:23; misthos here) implies proportional compensation -- you receive what your work merits. The wages of sin = death, not infinite torment.

## 8. G1341 -- dikaiokrasia (righteous judgment)
- **Definition:** a just sentence; righteous judgment
- **NT occurrence:** 1 (Rom 2:5 -- "revelation of the righteous judgment of God")
- **Significance:** God's judgment is not arbitrary but dikaiokrasia -- righteous judgment. This is a hapax legomenon (unique word) coined to describe God's eschatological judgment as inherently just.
