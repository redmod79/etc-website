## Hebrew Terms — Divine Character Vocabulary

### H4941 — mishpat (judgment/justice/ordinance)

**Translation Frequency:** 421 total occurrences; top translations: judgment (70, 16.6%), manner (79), cause (50), ordinance (49), right (48)

**Lexicon Definition:** from H8199; properly, a verdict (favorable or unfavorable) pronounced judicially, especially a sentence or formal decree (human or divine law, individual or collectively), including the act, the place, the suit, the crime, and the penalty; abstractly, justice, including a participant's right or privilege (statutory or customary) — judgment, justice, right, ordinance, cause.

**Key occurrence for "judgment" (69 times):** Deu 32:4; 2Sa 8:15; 1Ki 3:11; Job 8:3; Job 34:12; Psa 37:28; Psa 99:4; Isa 42:1; Isa 61:8; Jer 9:24; Eze 18:8; Amo 5:7; Amo 5:24; Hab 1:4 (x2); Zec 7:9 (selected)

**Study relevance:** mishpat is the primary Hebrew term for God's judicial acts and standards of justice. Appears in key texts: "A God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he" (Deu 32:4); "I the LORD love judgment" (Isa 61:8); "God executeth the judgment of the afflicted" (Psa 9:4 — context); "The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed" (Psa 103:6). The term encompasses both the process (the verdict-making) and the standard (what justice requires).

### H6664 — tsedeq (righteousness — masculine noun, the quality itself)

**Translation Frequency:** 119 total occurrences; top: righteousness (27, 22.7%), in righteousness (10), of righteousness (9), just (7)

**Lexicon Definition:** from H6663; the right (natural, moral or legal); also (abstractly) equity or (figuratively) prosperity — just(-ice), right(-eous).

**Study relevance:** tsedeq is the abstract quality of rightness/equity. Used in key judgment texts: "Judge of all the earth" context (Gen 18:25 uses tsaddiq/tsedaqah); "righteous in all his ways" (Psa 145:17 uses tsaddiq); "true and righteous are thy judgments" (Rev 19:2 uses dikaios in Greek). The OT witness to God's rightness/equity spans 119 occurrences.

---

### H6666 — tsedaqah (righteousness/justice — feminine noun, the act or manifestation)

**Translation Frequency:** 157 total occurrences; top: righteousness (79, 50.3%), justice (21, 13.4%), right (16)

**Lexicon Definition:** from H6663; rightness (abstractly), subjectively rectitude, objectively justice, morally virtue or concretely a right act — justice, right(-eous) act, righteousness.

**Study relevance:** tsedaqah is the expressed/applied form of righteousness — righteousness in action. "The LORD executeth righteousness [tsedaqah] and judgment for all that are oppressed" (Psa 103:6). "I the LORD love judgment; I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them" (Isa 61:8). God's tsedaqah is consistently paired with mishpat (judgment) as the two pillars of divine governance.

---

### H2617 — hesed (lovingkindness/steadfast love/mercy)

**Translation Frequency:** 248 total occurrences; top: lovingkindness (98, 39.5%), mercy (30), kindness (18), goodness (17)

**Lexicon Definition:** from H2616; kindness; by implication piety; rarely (by opposition) reproof, or (subject) beauty — favour, good deed(-liness, -ness), kindly, (loving-) kindness, merciful (kindness), mercy, pity.

**Study relevance:** hesed is the covenant-loyalty term — the unfailing love that holds to its commitments. The famous recurring phrase "his mercy endureth for ever" (Psa 136) uses hesed throughout. The Exo 34:6 divine self-disclosure formula includes: "keeping mercy [hesed] for thousands." Hesed is specifically covenant-relational — God's love as expressed in keeping faith with those in relationship with him. The question for Study 17: does God's hesed create any constraint on how he may treat those who ultimately have no covenant relationship with him (the finally wicked)?

### H7349 — rachum (compassionate — adjective form)

**Translation Frequency:** 13 total occurrences; all four translations = merciful / compassionate / full of compassion

**Lexicon Definition:** from H7355; compassionate — full of compassion, merciful.

**All 13 occurrences:** Exo 34:6; Deu 4:31; 2Ch 30:9; Neh 9:17; 9:31; Psa 78:38; 86:15; 103:8; 111:4; 112:4; 145:8; Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2

**Study relevance:** rachum appears in the Exo 34:6 divine self-disclosure formula as one of God's own named attributes: "The LORD, The LORD God, merciful [rachum] and gracious..." This is the foundational OT statement of God's character given by God himself. Appears repeatedly in Psalms (78:38; 86:15; 103:8; 111:4; 145:8) and in prophetic contexts where it explains God's willingness to relent from judgment (Joel 2:13; Jon 4:2).

---

### H2534 — chemah (fury/wrath/heat — divine and human anger)

**Translation Frequency:** 133 total occurrences; top: my fury (20, 15.0%), fury (8), wrath (8), in fury (5), my wrath (5); also includes poison/heat uses

**Lexicon Definition:** from H3179; heat; figuratively, anger, poison (from its fever) — anger, bottles, hot displeasure, furious(-ly, -ry), heat, indignation, poison, rage, wrath(-ful).

**Study relevance:** chemah is the intense, fierce-heat form of divine anger. Often appears as "my fury" (God speaking in first person). Key judgment texts: "I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes" (Ezk 25:17); "Pour out thy fury upon the heathen" (Jer 10:25). Chemah captures the seriousness and intensity of divine wrath — not a mild displeasure but a consuming fire-heat of anger directed at wickedness and rebellion. Important contrast: Isa 57:16 uses charah (H2734) and the divine declaration that God will NOT contend forever.

---

### H5678 — evrah (outburst of passion/wrath — the eruption of anger)

**Translation Frequency:** 37 total occurrences; top: of my wrath (5), wrath (4), of wrath (3), thy wrath (3)

**Lexicon Definition:** feminine of H5676; an outburst of passion — anger, rage, wrath.

**Study relevance:** evrah is specifically an "outburst" — a sudden eruption of passionate anger. Key texts: "a day of wrath [evrah] is that day" (Zep 1:15); "Through the wrath [evrah] of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire" (Isa 9:18). The outburst character of evrah is relevant to Study 17: God's wrath in judgment is presented as a decisive event (an outburst/eruption) rather than as an ongoing sustained state. This lexical quality is relevant to whether God's wrath demands a perpetual process or a decisive, complete act.

## Greek Terms — NT Divine Character and Judgment Vocabulary

### G3709 — orge (wrath/anger)

**Translation Frequency:** 33 total occurrences; top: wrath (21, 63.6%), anger (3), the wrath (3), of wrath (3)

**Lexicon Definition:** from G3713; properly, desire (as a reaching forth or excitement of the mind), i.e. (by analogy), violent passion (ire, or justifiably abhorrence); by implication punishment — anger, indignation, vengeance, wrath.

**Verses for "wrath" (21 of 33 occurrences):** Luk 21:23; Rom 2:5; Rom 2:8; Rom 4:15; Rom 5:9; Rom 9:22; Rom 13:4; Rom 13:5; Eph 5:6; Col 3:6; 1Th 1:10; 1Th 2:16; 1Th 5:9; 1Ti 2:8; Heb 3:11; Heb 4:3; Rev 6:16; Rev 6:17; Rev 11:18; Rev 16:19; Rev 19:15

**Key eschatological texts:** John 3:36 ("the wrath of God abideth on him"); Rom 1:18 ("the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness"); Rom 2:5 ("treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath"); 1Th 1:10 ("Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come"); Rev 19:15 ("winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God").

**Study relevance:** orge is the dominant NT term for divine wrath. Its 33 occurrences span epistles, Gospels, and Revelation. Crucially, orge is paired in key texts with the action of BEING DELIVERED from wrath (1Th 1:10; Rom 5:9) — suggesting wrath terminates (those who are saved escape it) rather than functions as a perpetual state for the condemned.

### G1342 — dikaios (righteous/just — adjective)

**Translation Frequency:** 68 total occurrences; top: righteous (17, 25.0%), just (12), the righteous (5), right (4)

**Lexicon Definition:** from G1349; equitable (in character or act); by implication, innocent, holy (absolutely or relatively) — just, meet, right(-eous).

**Key eschatological occurrences:** 2Th 1:5,6 ("righteous judgment of God... a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you"); Rev 15:3 ("just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints"); Rev 16:5 ("Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus"); Rev 16:7 ("Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments"); Rev 19:2 ("true and righteous are his judgments").

**Study relevance:** The Revelation judgment doxologies (Rev 15:3; 16:5,7; 19:2) all affirm God's judgments as dikaios — equitable, just, right. This is the criterion by which the judgments are evaluated and praised. Study 17 must assess whether ECT or annihilation better satisfies the dikaios criterion as Scripture applies it.

---

### G1343 — dikaiosyne (righteousness/equity — noun)

**Translation Frequency:** 80 total occurrences; top: righteousness (42, 52.5%), of righteousness (18), the righteousness (9)

**Lexicon Definition:** from G1342; equity (of character or act); specially (Christian) justification — righteousness.

**Key texts:** Rom 3:4-6 ("God forbid: yea, let God be true... that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings... Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? God forbid"); Rom 3:21-26 ("the righteousness of God... that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus"); 2Th 1:5 ("the righteous judgment of God").

**Study relevance:** God's dikaiosyne is the standard against which his judgment is measured — he cannot be unjust (Rom 3:5; 9:14). The NT affirms both God's righteousness and his right to judge as expressions of the same character. The question for Study 17: does dikaiosyne (God's righteousness/equity) require or forbid ECT? Does it require or forbid complete destruction?

### G1656 — eleos (mercy/compassion — noun)

**Translation Frequency:** 24 total occurrences; top: mercy (20, 83.3%)

**Lexicon Definition:** of uncertain affinity; compassion (human or divine, especially active) — (+ tender) mercy.

**Key texts:** Luke 1:50 ("his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation"); Luke 1:72,78 ("to perform the mercy promised to our fathers"; "through the tender mercy of our God"); Ephesians 2:4 ("God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us"); Titus 3:5 ("according to his mercy he saved us"); James 2:13 ("mercy rejoiceth against judgment"); Hebrews 4:16 ("obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need").

**Study relevance:** James 2:13 is critical: "mercy rejoiceth against judgment" — mercy is not eliminated by judgment but is proclaimed as triumphant over (or alongside) judgment. The character of God as "rich in mercy" (Eph 2:4) is the background against which his judgment operates. 1 John 4:8 ("God is love") and Jas 2:13 are the NT anchors for the theological argument that God's love/mercy constrains or shapes the form of his judgment.

---

### G684 — apoleia (destruction/perdition — noun)

**Translation Frequency:** 17 total occurrences; top: perdition (5, 29.4%), destruction (4)

**Lexicon Definition:** from a presumed derivative of G622; ruin or loss (physical, spiritual or eternal) — damnable(-nation), destruction, die, perdition, perish.

**Key eschatological texts:** Mat 7:13 ("broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction"); Phil 3:19 ("whose end is destruction"); 2Th 2:3 ("the son of perdition"); Rev 17:8,11 (beast "goeth into perdition" — twice).

**Study relevance:** apoleia is the noun form of the eschatological outcome for the wicked. Established in etc5-06: it stands in structural antithesis to zoe (life) throughout the NT (N030). For Study 17: apoleia is what God's judgment produces — it names the outcome. Whether the outcome is consistent with God's character of justice and mercy is the study's central question.

---

### G622 — apollumi (to destroy fully / perish — verb)

**Translation Frequency:** 84 total occurrences; top: perish (10, 11.9%), to destroy (7), shall lose (7), destroy (5)

**Lexicon Definition:** from G575 and base of G3639; to destroy fully (reflexively, to perish, or lose), literally or figuratively — destroy, die, lose, mar, perish.

**Study relevance:** The verb form of the eschatological outcome. God "is able to destroy [apolesai — aorist active infinitive of apollumi] both soul and body in gehenna" (Mat 10:28, E26). The range of apollumi (92 NT occurrences) includes: John 3:16 (not perish/have life), John 10:28 (shall never perish), 2 Pet 3:9 (not willing that any should perish). God's character as revealed in John 3:16 and 2 Pet 3:9 is the character of one who desires that people NOT perish — which makes his eventual judgment of those who do perish an act that he does not take pleasure in, consistent with Ezk 18:23,32 and 33:11.
