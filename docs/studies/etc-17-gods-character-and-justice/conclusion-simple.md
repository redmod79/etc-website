# God's Character, Justice, and the Fate of the Wicked

## Introduction

This study asks a straightforward question: Is God's character as revealed in Scripture more consistent with the eternal conscious torment of the wicked, or with their ultimate destruction? To answer it, we look at what the Bible explicitly says about who God is, how He punishes, and what happens in every recorded divine judgment. The findings consistently point in one direction.

## What the Bible Says About God's Character

God's most direct self-description is found in Exodus 34:6-7, where He proclaims His own name to Moses:

> "The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children... unto the third and to the fourth generation."

Notice the proportion: six attributes describe mercy and grace before two describe judgment. And even within the judgment clause, mercy extends to "thousands" while the punishment of iniquity reaches only "the third and fourth generation." This same formula is repeated across the Old Testament -- in Psalm 86:15, 103:8, 145:8, Joel 2:13, and Jonah 4:2 -- showing it is not a one-time statement but a settled, repeated description of who God is.

Two passages go further and say explicitly that God's anger does not last forever:

> "He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever." (Psalm 103:9)

> "He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy." (Micah 7:18)

And three separate passages state that God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked:

> "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?... I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth." (Ezekiel 18:23, 32)

> "I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live." (Ezekiel 33:11)

Scripture also affirms this from a different angle:

> "The Lord is... not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance." (2 Peter 3:9)

> "Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth." (1 Timothy 2:4)

## What the Bible Says About How God Punishes

Scripture is consistent and emphatic that divine punishment is proportional -- that is, it corresponds to what a person actually did. This is not a minor point found in one verse. It is stated in at least eleven passages across nine different biblical authors, spanning both testaments:

- "Who will render to every man according to his deeds." (Romans 2:6)
- "The work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways." (Job 34:11)
- "He that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done." (Colossians 3:25)
- "Every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward." (Hebrews 2:2)

Jesus Himself taught that judgment will vary by degree. Some will receive "many stripes," others "few stripes," depending on what they knew and did (Luke 12:47-48). He said it will be "more tolerable" for Sodom in the day of judgment than for cities that rejected His gospel (Matthew 10:15), and that some will face "sorer punishment" than others (Hebrews 10:29).

This principle of proportional punishment is foundational. Punishment is measured against what a person did -- finite deeds by finite people. Infinite, unending punishment for finite deeds cannot be squared with the Bible's consistent teaching that punishment is "according to deeds."

## What the Bible Says About the Penalty for Sin

The stated penalty for sin across both testaments is death -- not torment. Scripture uses this language consistently:

> "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." (Romans 6:23)

> "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." (Ezekiel 18:4, 20)

> "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." (Genesis 2:17)

And every actual judgment God carries out in the biblical record results in death or destruction -- not ongoing torment. The flood: those outside the ark "died" and were "destroyed" (Genesis 7:21-23). Sodom: God "overthrew" the cities (Genesis 19:24-25). Korah and his company: they "perished" and were "consumed" (Numbers 16:31-35). Nadab and Abihu: they were "devoured" and "died" (Leviticus 10:1-2). In the book of Nahum, God describes His judgment of Nineveh: "he will make an utter end" (Nahum 1:8-9). The pattern is uniform. When God judges, the result is destruction.

Psalm 145:17, 20 brings these threads together:

> "The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works... The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy."

## The Main Argument for Eternal Torment -- and Why It Falls Short

The most common argument for eternal conscious torment is not drawn directly from any biblical text. It runs as follows: sin against an infinite God deserves infinite punishment, therefore the wicked must suffer infinitely. This argument was developed by Anselm of Canterbury around 1098 AD as part of his broader theological system. It is a philosophical inference, not something any verse of Scripture actually says.

No biblical passage states that the severity of punishment is measured by the dignity of the one offended. Every passage that addresses the measure of punishment measures it by the deeds of the offender -- "according to his deeds," "according to his ways," "many stripes" or "few stripes." The Anselmian argument imports a measurement standard from outside the biblical text and contradicts the measurement standard the text itself consistently uses.

## Summary of Findings

What the Bible explicitly states:

1. God's self-revealed character is predominantly merciful, with mercy described as far exceeding judgment in scope (Exodus 34:6-7, repeated in five other passages).
2. God does not retain anger forever -- two passages state this directly (Psalm 103:9; Micah 7:18).
3. God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked -- three passages state this directly (Ezekiel 18:23, 32; 33:11).
4. Divine punishment is proportional to deeds -- stated in at least eleven passages across both testaments (Romans 2:6; Job 34:11; Luke 12:47-48; Matthew 10:15; Hebrews 2:2; Hebrews 10:29; and others).
5. The stated penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23; Ezekiel 18:4, 20; Genesis 2:17).
6. Every recorded divine judgment in Scripture results in death or destruction, never ongoing torment.
7. Destruction as the final fate of the wicked is consistent with all of the above: proportional justice, the temporary nature of divine anger, the stated penalty of death, God's self-revealed character, and the observed pattern of every biblical judgment.
8. The "infinite punishment for sin against an infinite God" argument appears in no biblical text. It is a philosophical construct that contradicts the biblical standard of measuring punishment "according to deeds."

## Conclusion

When we read what Scripture explicitly says about God's character, we find a God who is merciful, slow to anger, reluctant to execute judgment, and unwilling that any should perish. When we read what Scripture explicitly says about divine punishment, we find it described as proportional, finite, and corresponding to actual deeds. When we look at every historical divine judgment in the biblical record, we find death and destruction -- not ongoing torment. And when we look at what Scripture says the penalty for sin actually is, we find the word "death," consistently, across both testaments.

The annihilation view -- that the wicked will ultimately be destroyed rather than tormented forever -- fits all of this evidence. The eternal torment view requires setting aside the proportionality principle, overriding the explicit statements that God does not retain anger forever, and relying on a philosophical argument that no biblical author ever makes.

The conclusion is not that eternal torment is impossible to believe, but that the biblical evidence, taken at face value, consistently describes the fate of the wicked as death and destruction. A God who punishes "according to deeds," who "retaineth not his anger for ever," who has "no pleasure in the death of the wicked," is a God whose justice is expressed in the ending of the wicked -- not their endless suffering.
