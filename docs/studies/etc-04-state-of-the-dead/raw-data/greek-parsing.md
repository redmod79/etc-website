### Grammatical Notes
- **σήμερον** (sēmeron, G4594): adverb "today" — no ambiguity in the Greek word itself; the punctuation debate is about whether "today" goes with "I say" or with "you will be with me." The Greek text (N1904) has no punctuation. The KJV (and most translations) connect "today" with "you will be in paradise." A minority reading: "Verily I say to you today, you will be with me in paradise" (comma after "today").
- **ἔσῃ** (esesth, future middle indicative): "you will be" — states a future reality; the question is whether it is immediate future or eschatological future.
- **Παραδείσῳ** (G3857): paradise — a Persian loanword. Used 3 times in NT: Luke 23:43; 2 Cor 12:4; Rev 2:7. In 2 Cor 12:4 Paul describes visiting it in a vision (possibly the third heaven). In Rev 2:7 it is the eschatological garden where the tree of life is.
- **μετ' ἐμοῦ** (with me): the promise is personal presence with Christ.

### Grammatical Notes
- **ἀναλῦσαι** (G360, aor act inf): "to depart" or "to dissolve/break up." The word is used in Phil 1:23 and Luke 12:36 (returning from the feast). Figuratively = to break camp; to depart from life = to die. The aorist infinitive simply designates the action without aspect indicating timing or duration.
- **σὺν Χριστῷ εἶναι** (with Christ to be): infinitive phrase — "to be with Christ." The present infinitive εἶναι suggests continuous state; the phrase is the desired result of departing.
- **κρεῖσσον** (G2908): "better" (comparative) — Paul is comparing alternatives. The comparison is: remaining in flesh (vv.21-22) vs. departing and being with Christ (v.23).
- **Structure**: There is no explicit temporal connector between "depart" and "be with Christ" — the grammar does not resolve whether the presence with Christ is immediate upon death or eschatological (at resurrection). The IC001 interpretation (subjective time-collapse) is grammatically compatible; neither is demanded by the grammar alone.

```

### Grammatical Notes
- **ἐκδημέω** (G1553) / **ἐνδημέω** (G1736): "to be away from home" / "to be at home." These are travel/residence metaphors — being "away from" vs. "dwelling with." In v.6, Paul says we are currently "at home in the body" (endēmountes) and "absent from the Lord" (ekdēmoumen). V.8 reverses this.
- **Context (2 Cor 5:4)**: Paul explicitly states "not for that we would be unclothed [naked, gumnos], but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life." Paul does NOT want the disembodied state; he wants the resurrection clothing. V.8 expresses a preference between being "at home in the body" (away from the Lord) vs. being "away from the body" (at home with the Lord). The preference is for the latter even though it involves the nakedness he doesn't want — or, alternatively, he is thinking of the resurrection-clothed state as the "at home with the Lord" outcome.
- **Aorist infinitives**: Both ἐκδημῆσαι and ἐνδημῆσαι are aorist active infinitives. The aorist does not necessarily indicate punctiliar/immediate action; it simply presents the action as a whole.

### Grammatical Notes
- **κοιμηθέντας** (G2837, koimao): aorist passive participle — "the ones having been put to sleep." The participle form explicitly identifies the group as those who died. This is the third use of koimao in the 1 Thess 4 passage (vv.13,14,15).
- **ἄξει σὺν αὐτῷ**: "will bring with him" — God will bring the sleeping ones WITH Jesus. This is the resurrection event described in vv.16-17: "the dead in Christ shall rise first" and then be caught up. The "bringing" = the resurrection bringing forth, not a prior transit from an intermediate location.

## Acts 7:60 — Stephen "fell asleep"

```
Greek Text: θεὶς δὲ τὰ γόνατα ἔκραξεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Κύριε, μὴ στήσῃς αὐτοῖς ταύτην τὴν ἁμαρτίαν. καὶ τοῦτο εἰπὼν ἐκοιμήθη.

```

### Grammatical Notes
- **ἐκοιμήθη** (G2837): aorist passive indicative, 3rd singular — "he fell asleep." Luke uses this as the description of Stephen's death. The same passage (v.59) has Stephen committing his spirit to the Lord: "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." Luke saw no contradiction between committing one's spirit (a present action at the moment of death) and sleep being the state that follows. The spirit-commendation formula (v.59) does not imply consciousness continues after death — it is a prayer at the moment of dying.

## 1 Corinthians 15:18 — "Fallen asleep in Christ are perished"

```

### Grammatical Notes
- **ἀπώλοντο** (G622, apollumi): aorist middle indicative — "have perished." This is the same word used in John 3:16 ("should not perish") and Matt 10:28 ("destroy both soul and body"). Paul's conditional argument (vv.14-19): IF there is no resurrection, THEN those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. This is a reductio ad absurdum: Paul uses the consequent (they have perished) as obviously unacceptable, meaning he affirms the resurrection IS true. But the logical structure reveals Paul's framework: without resurrection, those who died = perished (not: "they are with Christ in a conscious state anyway"). If the conscious intermediate state were assumed, the reductio would fail — one could say "they are already with Christ whether or not there's a resurrection." Paul's argument requires that without resurrection, they have truly perished.
