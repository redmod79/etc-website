G2518 (katheudo) is the general word for sleep and appears in literal night-sleep contexts more often; G2837 (koimao) is the specifically euphemistic/technical term Paul uses for the death of believers (never for simple rest/night-sleep in Paul).

### Descriptive vocabulary associated with Sheol in context:
- "land of forgetfulness" (Ps 88:12)
- "darkness" (Job 17:13; Ps 88:6,12; Isa 38:18)
- "silence" (Ps 115:17 — "go down into silence")
- "pit" (Job 17:16; 33:18; Ps 30:9; Isa 38:18)
- "no return" (Job 7:9-10; 16:22)
- Dead "cut off from thy hand" (Ps 88:5)
- Sheol cannot praise (Isa 38:18)
- Worms under; worms cover (Isa 14:11)
- Prisoners rest (Job 3:17-18)
- No activity: "no work, device, knowledge, wisdom" (Ecc 9:10)

### Note on Sheol etymology
Sheol's etymology is disputed. The definition "subterranean retreat" comes from the rendering "as if." The word appears 65 times and consistently describes the place of the dead — all the dead, both righteous and wicked, are in sheol (Ps 49:14-15; Isa 14:9-11).

## G86 — ᾅδης (hades)

### Lexicon
```
G86: ᾅδης
Transliteration: háidēs
Pronunciation:   hah
Part of Speech:  proper locative noun (n-pr)
BLB Count:       11

Definition:
  from (as negative particle) and; properly, unseen, i.e. "Hades"
  or the place (state) of departed souls: grave, hell

Outline of Biblical Usage (11 NT occurrences):
  Matthew 11:23; 16:18 Luke 10:15; 16:23 Acts 2:24,27,31
  1 Corinthians 15:55 Revelation 1:18; 6:8; 20:13
```

### LXX Background
The LXX (Greek OT) uses hades to translate the Hebrew sheol in the majority of cases. The two terms are therefore functionally equivalent in their domains: the realm of the dead.

### Translation Distribution (KJV)
```
G86 - 11 total occurrences, 4 unique translations:
     7 ( 63.6%) hell
     2 ( 18.2%) of hell
     1 (  9.1%) O grave
     1 (  9.1%) Hell
```

### Key Occurrences
- Matt 11:23: "Capernaum...shalt be brought down to hell [hades]"
- Matt 16:18: "gates of hell [hades] shall not prevail against it"
- Luke 16:23: "in hell [hades] he lift up his eyes, being in torments"
- Acts 2:27: "thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [hades]" (Ps 16:10 LXX)
- Acts 2:31: "his soul was not left in hell [hades], neither his flesh did see corruption"
- Rev 1:18: "I have the keys of hell [hades] and of death"
- Rev 6:8: "Death, and Hell [hades] followed with him"
- Rev 20:13: "death and hell [hades] delivered up the dead which were in them"
- Rev 20:14: "death and hell [hades] were cast into the lake of fire"

### Key Observation
Rev 20:13-14: Hades is a temporary state. At the final resurrection, hades delivers up the dead and is itself cast into the lake of fire. This indicates hades = holding state before judgment, not final destination.

```

### Key Uses
- Literal physical death: 1 Thess 4:16 ("the dead in Christ shall rise first")
- Metaphorical spiritual death: Eph 2:1 ("dead in trespasses and sins"); Eph 5:14 ("thou that sleepest...arise from the dead")

## G5590 — ψυχή (psyche)

### Lexicon
```
G5590: ψυχή
Transliteration: psychḗ
Pronunciation:   psoo-khay
Part of Speech:  feminine noun (n-f)
BLB Count:       105

Definition:
  from; breath, i.e. (by implication) spirit, abstractly or
  concretely (the animal sentient principle only; thus distinguished
  from pneuma, which is the rational and immortal soul); the soul,
  life, the living soul

Outline of Biblical Usage (extensive — 105 occurrences):
  [Covers OT instances through LXX, and full NT]
  Key: Genesis 1:20; 2:7; 9:4; 35:18 / Rev 6:9; 8:9; 20:4

### Translation Distribution (KJV)

    32 ( 36.8%) soul
    25 ( 28.7%) life
    18 ( 20.7%) souls
     4 (  4.6%) lives
[+ 8 rare translations]
```

### Key Death-State Occurrences
- Rev 6:9: "the souls (psychas) of them that were slain" — under altar in vision
- Rev 20:4: "I saw the souls (psychas) of them that were beheaded" — lived and reigned
- Rev 16:3: "every living soul (psyche) died" — souls can die
- Matt 10:28: "fear him which is able to destroy both soul (psychen) and body"
- Gen 35:18 (LXX basis): "as her soul was in departing, (for she died)" — soul departure = death

### Note on Psyche Range
Psyche in NT ranges from "breath/life-force" (biologically = alive) to "whole person" to "inner self." Rev 6:9 uses psyche for martyrs "under the altar" — the most direct NT text using psyche in an intermediate-state context.

## H7496 — רָפָא (rapha/rephaim)

### Lexicon
```
H7496: רָפָא
Transliteration: râphâʼ
Pronunciation:   raw-faw
Part of Speech:  masculine plural noun (n)
BLB Count:       8

Definition:
  from in the sense of; properly, lax, i.e. (figuratively) a
  ghost (as dead; in plural only): dead, deceased

Outline of Biblical Usage (8 occurrences):
  Job 26:5 Psalms 88:11 Proverbs 2:18; 9:18; 21:16 Isaiah 14:9; 26:14; 26:19
```

### Translation Distribution (KJV)
```
H7496 - 8 total occurrences, 4 unique translations:
     5 ( 62.5%) the dead
     1 ( 12.5%) Dead
     1 ( 12.5%) of the dead
     1 ( 12.5%) deceased
```

### Root Meaning
Root: rapha — "to be slack, lax, weak" — the rephaim are the "limp/slack ones" — denoting the powerless, inert state of the dead.

### Key Occurrences
- Job 26:5: "Dead things [rephaim] are formed from under the waters" — rephaim in sheol below the deep
- Ps 88:10-11: "Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead [rephaim]? shall the dead [rephaim] arise and praise thee? Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave?" — rephaim = those who do NOT arise and praise
- Prov 2:18: "her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead [rephaim]"
- Prov 9:18: "he knoweth not that the dead [rephaim] are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell"
- Prov 21:16: "The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead [rephaim]"
- Isa 14:9: "Hell from beneath is moved for thee...it stirreth up the dead [rephaim] for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth"
- Isa 26:14: "They are dead [rephaim], they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise"
- Isa 26:19: "the earth shall cast out the dead [rephaim]" — in contrast to v.14, the righteous dead will rise

### Key Observation
The root meaning "lax/slack" defines rephaim as the "flaccid ones" — emphasizing the inert, inactive character of the dead in sheol. Isa 26:14 uses rephaim in the clearest statement that the wicked dead "shall not live...shall not rise," directly contrasted with the righteous dead rising in v.19.
