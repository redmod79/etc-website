# Concept Context -- Raw Data for etc-04

## 2 Corinthians 5:8
- **Result:** "No theological concepts found in 2 Corinthians 5:8"

This is because the verse uses general language ("absent from the body," "present with the Lord") rather than tagged theological terms. The verse must be analyzed in its literary context (2 Cor 5:1-10) and compared with Paul's other death-state passages manually.

### Key Observation
The concept_context tool confirms that 1 Thess 4:14 links three central theological concepts: FAITH, DEATH, and RESURRECTION. Paul's other uses of these three concepts together consistently tie "being with the Lord" to the resurrection event, not to an intermediate state. Notably, Rom 13:11 uses "awake out of sleep" (resurrection language) and connects it to salvation timing, reinforcing the sleep-death-resurrection pattern.
