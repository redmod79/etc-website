# State of the Dead -- Conscious or Unconscious?

## Question
What is the state of the dead between death and resurrection -- conscious or unconscious? Examine ALL Old Testament death-state passages, ALL New Testament death-as-sleep passages, and ALL alleged conscious intermediate state passages.

## Summary Answer
The Old Testament consistently describes the dead as unconscious: their thoughts perish (Ps 146:4), they know nothing (Ecc 9:5), they dwell in silence (Ps 115:17), forgetfulness (Ps 88:12), and darkness (Job 10:21-22). At least eight OT authors across six or more books make these statements. The New Testament calls death "sleep" through at least seven authors, including Jesus (John 11:11-14; Matt 9:24) and Paul (1 Cor 15:6,18,51; 1 Thess 4:13-15). Paul ties "being with the Lord" to the resurrection and second coming (1 Thess 4:16-17), not to an intermediate state. Peter states David "is not ascended into the heavens" (Acts 2:34). Hebrews states the OT faithful "died in faith, not having received the promises" (11:13,39-40). Sheol (H7585, 67 occurrences) and hades (G86, 11 occurrences) are the abode of the dead, characterized by unconsciousness, silence, and darkness (Ecc 9:10; Ps 6:5; 115:17). The alleged conscious intermediate state passages (2 Cor 5:8; Phil 1:23; Luke 23:43; Luke 16:19-31; Rev 6:9-11; 1 Sam 28; Matt 17:1-9; 1 Pet 3:18-20) are each subject to genre, grammatical, or contextual qualifications that prevent them from functioning as plain didactic evidence for consciousness between death and resurrection.

## Key Verses
- **Ps 146:4** -- "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish"
- **Ecc 9:5-6** -- "The dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward"
- **Ecc 9:10** -- "There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave"
- **Ps 6:5** -- "In death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?"
- **Ps 115:17** -- "The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence"
- **Job 14:12,21** -- "Man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake"; "His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not"
- **John 11:11-14** -- "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth... Lazarus is dead"
- **1 Thess 4:16-17** -- "The dead in Christ shall rise first: then we... caught up... and so shall we ever be with the Lord"
- **Acts 2:29,34** -- "David... is both dead and buried"; "David is not ascended into the heavens"
- **Heb 11:13,39-40** -- "These all died in faith, not having received the promises... they without us should not be made perfect"

**Neutral E-item classification notes:**

**E38/E155 (Luke 16:19-31) -- Parable of Rich Man and Lazarus -- Classified: Neutral**
- Step 1 Vocabulary Scan: V2 -- "Torments," "tormented in this flame." Conscious-torment vocabulary is present. Candidate: ECT. Go to Step 2.
- Step 2 Validation Gates:
  - Gate 1 (Subject): The rich man is a character in a parable (the passage follows a series of parables in Luke 15-16). FAIL: subject is an allegorical character in a parable.
  - Gate 3 (Genre): Parabolic. FAIL: genre is parabolic.
- Step 3 Reclassification:
  - RC1: Gate 1 failure -- the rich man is a parabolic character. Gate 3 failure -- the genre is parabolic.
  - RC2: Corrected observation: "A parable depicts a character in hades experiencing torment, with the narrative point being 'they have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them' (v.29)."
  - RC3: Re-enter V1/V2: parabolic depiction does not constitute didactic teaching about the literal state of the dead. Neither V1 nor V2 applies to parabolic characters as evidence about literal human fate.
- Result: **Neutral.** The observation that a parable depicts this imagery is accepted by both sides. The interpretation of whether the imagery teaches about the afterlife is disputed.

**E39/E156 (Rev 6:9-11) -- Souls Under the Altar -- Classified: Neutral**
- Step 1 Vocabulary Scan: V2 -- "Souls" (psychai) "cried with a loud voice." Conscious activity vocabulary. Candidate: ECT. Go to Step 2.
- Step 2 Validation Gates:
  - Gate 1 (Subject): The "souls" are in an apocalyptic vision. They are symbolic entities in a highly symbolic book (four horsemen, stars falling, sky rolling up). FAIL: subjects are symbolic entities in an apocalyptic vision.
  - Gate 3 (Genre): Apocalyptic vision. FAIL: genre is apocalyptic.
- Step 3 Reclassification:
  - RC1: Gate 1 failure -- souls under the altar are symbolic vision-figures. Gate 3 failure -- apocalyptic genre.
  - RC2: Corrected observation: "In an apocalyptic vision, John sees symbolic figures (souls under the altar) who cry out and are told to rest."
  - RC3: Re-enter V1/V2: symbolic apocalyptic imagery does not constitute didactic teaching about the literal state of the dead. Parallel: Abel's blood "crieth" from the ground (Gen 4:10) without being literally conscious.
- Result: **Neutral.** The textual observation is accepted by both sides. The interpretation of whether this depicts literal consciousness is disputed.

**E40/E157 (1 Sam 28:11-19) -- Witch of Endor -- Classified: Neutral**
- Step 1 Vocabulary Scan: V2 -- An apparition identified as Samuel "speaks." Conscious-activity vocabulary applied to a dead person. Candidate: ECT. Go to Step 2.
- Step 2 Validation Gates:
  - Gate 3 (Genre): Historical narrative of a prohibited practice. Necromancy is explicitly forbidden (Deut 18:10-12; 1 Chr 10:13-14). The Bible reports events in prohibited practices without endorsing their theological claims. FAIL: narrative of a prohibited practice does not constitute didactic teaching.
  - Gate 4 (Harmony): If this apparition is genuinely Samuel, his statement "tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me" means Saul goes to the same place as Samuel (sheol). This is consistent with both righteous and wicked going to sheol (E167). But the passage conflicts with E019 (dead know nothing) and E011 (thoughts perish) if taken as teaching the dead are conscious. SIS: multiple didactic passages describe the dead as unconscious; one narrative of a prohibited practice describes an apparition speaking. The didactic passages govern. FAIL on harmony if read as ECT evidence.
- Step 3 Reclassification:
  - RC1: Gate 3 failure -- narrative of prohibited practice. Gate 4 failure -- conflicts with didactic passages on death-state.
  - RC2: Corrected observation: "In a narrative of a forbidden necromantic practice, an apparition identified as Samuel speaks to Saul." The passage reports what appeared to happen but does not constitute didactic teaching about the state of the dead.
  - RC3: Re-enter V1/V2: the corrected observation is a narrative report of a prohibited practice. Neither V1 nor V2 applies as evidence about the normal state of the dead.
- Result: **Neutral.** Both sides accept that the text reports this event. The interpretation of its theological significance is disputed.

**E41/E158 (Matt 17:3,9) -- Transfiguration -- Classified: Neutral**
- Step 1 Vocabulary Scan: V2 -- Moses and Elijah appear "talking with" Jesus. Conscious-activity vocabulary applied to figures who include at least one dead person (Moses). Candidate: ECT. Go to Step 2.
- Step 2 Validation Gates:
  - Gate 1 (Subject): Moses died (Deut 34:5-6) but Jude 9 references Michael contending over Moses' body (a possible resurrection). Elijah was translated bodily (2 Ki 2:11) and never died. The subjects are unique cases, not representative of the normal dead.
  - Gate 3 (Genre): Jesus himself calls this "the vision" (horama, Matt 17:9). A vision is not the same as a didactic passage about the state of the dead. FAIL: genre is vision.
- Step 3 Reclassification:
  - RC1: Gate 3 failure -- Jesus identifies this as a vision.
  - RC2: Corrected observation: "In a vision (Jesus' own word), Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus."
  - RC3: Re-enter V1/V2: a supernatural vision depicting unique cases (one translated, one possibly resurrected) does not constitute didactic teaching about the normal state of the dead.
- Result: **Neutral.** The textual observation is accepted by both sides. The interpretation of whether this teaches about the normal death-state is disputed.

Creation = dust + breath = living soul; death = dust returns + spirit returns = living soul ceases. | N006 |
| N3 | The sleep metaphor for death implies unconsciousness, rest, and future awakening | E24, E25, E26, E31, E32, E33 | Neutral | E24 (multiple authors call death "sleep"). E25 (Jesus equates sleep with dead). E31 (Jeremiah: perpetual sleep, not wake). E32 (Daniel: sleep in dust, awake). E33 (Daniel: rest, then stand in lot). The properties of sleep (unconsciousness, rest, awakening) map onto death (unconsciousness between death and resurrection, rest from labors, awakening at resurrection). | N017 *NEW* |
| N4 | Being "with the Lord" is tied to the resurrection and second coming, not to death | E44, E45, E47, E48, E50, E51 | Cond. | E44 (1 Thess 4:16-17): dead rise first, THEN caught up, "so shall we ever be with the Lord." E45 (1 Cor 15:53-54): immortality put on at resurrection. E47 (John 6): raised at the last day (4x). E48 (John 11:24): resurrection at the last day. E50 (John 20:17): Jesus not yet ascended on resurrection morning. E51 (John 14:3): "I will come again and receive you." Six passages from three authors (Paul, Jesus, John) tie union with Christ to the future event of resurrection/return, not to the moment of death. | N018 *NEW* |
| N5 | Sheol/hades is the common destination of all the dead (both righteous and wicked), not a divided conscious realm | E55, E56, E4/E58 | Neutral | E55: both righteous (Jacob, David) and wicked (Ps 9:17, Korah) go to sheol. E56: Christ's soul was in hades (Acts 2:27,31). E4/E58 (Ecc 9:10): sheol is characterized by no work, device, knowledge, wisdom. Both sides accept that sheol/hades receives all the dead. The characterization of sheol as unconscious (Ecc 9:10; Ps 6:5; 115:17) follows from E-items. | N019 *NEW* |
| N6 | Hades is temporary, not the final state of the dead | E57 | Neutral | E57 (Rev 20:13-14): death and hades deliver up the dead and are cast into the lake of fire. Hades is a holding state that ends. | N020 *NEW* |
| N7 | The righteous dead have not yet received their reward | E49, E52, E53 | Cond. | E49 (Acts 2:29,34): David is not ascended to heaven. E52 (Heb 11:13,39-40): heroes died without receiving the promises; they "without us should not be made perfect." E53 (2 Tim 4:8): crown given "at that day" (Christ's appearing). Three passages from different authors state the righteous dead are waiting, not yet rewarded. | N021 *NEW* |

**N-tier verification (3-question test applied to each):**

- **N1/N004:** (1) An ECT scholar would acknowledge these texts describe the dead as lacking knowledge, thoughts, praise, etc. The scholar would qualify these statements (e.g., "under the sun" limitation, or "from an earthly perspective"). The N-item states what the combined texts say. An ECT scholar must acknowledge the combined testimony. The positional classification is because one side must qualify or limit these statements to maintain their position. (2) "Know not any thing" plus "thoughts perish" has one meaning. YES. (3) Zero added: YES. PASSES.

- **N2/N006:** (1) Both sides agree death reverses creation. YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N3/N017:** (1) Both sides agree the sleep metaphor describes death as rest with future awakening. The question is whether "sleep" implies unconsciousness. Sleeping people are characteristically unconscious -- this is what sleep IS. An ECT scholar can acknowledge sleep = unconsciousness as the metaphor's content while arguing the metaphor is incomplete. But the N-item only states what the metaphor implies, which both sides accept. YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N4/N018:** (1) Would an ECT scholar agree these texts tie being with the Lord to the resurrection/second coming? An ECT scholar would acknowledge these texts describe the resurrection as the point of union but would argue other texts (2 Cor 5:8; Phil 1:23) describe a prior intermediate presence. The N-item states what THESE texts say. However, the claim that being with the Lord is tied EXCLUSIVELY to resurrection is what ECT scholars would contest. The N-item as stated is positional because it claims "not to death." Revised assessment: The statement "these passages tie being with the Lord to the resurrection" is neutral. The added "not to death" makes it positional. Keeping as N-item Conditionalist because ECT must add 2 Cor 5:8/Phil 1:23 (inference-level passages) to qualify these plain didactic passages. (2) The texts state one thing. YES. (3) Zero added to what these texts say. YES. PASSES.

- **N5/N019:** (1) Both sides agree both righteous and wicked go to sheol. YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N6/N020:** (1) Both sides agree hades is temporary (Rev 20:13-14 states it). YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N7/N021:** (1) An ECT scholar would argue the righteous dead are in heaven even if not yet "perfected" in the Heb 11:40 sense. They would argue Acts 2:34 means David has not ascended bodily but is present spiritually. The N-item states what the texts say: David is NOT ascended to heaven (Peter's direct statement), the heroes did NOT receive the promise (Hebrews' direct statement), the crown is at "that day" (Paul's direct statement). The ECT reading requires adding qualifiers ("not ascended bodily," "not received the promise fully") that the text does not contain. Positional classification stands because one side must qualify these statements. (2) The statements have one plain meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| I1 | The dead exist in a state of complete unconsciousness (soul sleep) from death until the resurrection, experiencing no subjective passage of time | I-A | Cond. | E1 (Ps 146:4): thoughts perish. E2 (Ecc 9:5): dead know nothing. E4 (Ecc 9:10): no work/knowledge/wisdom in sheol. E7 (Ps 6:5): no remembrance. E8 (Ps 115:17): silence. E11 (Job 14:12): sleep till heavens no more. E12 (Job 14:21): no awareness. E24 (death = sleep by 7+ authors). N1: dead are unconscious. N3: sleep implies unconsciousness. N4: being with Lord at resurrection. N7: righteous dead not yet rewarded. | All vocabulary and concepts are drawn from E/N tables. It is an inference because it systematizes multiple E/N items into a comprehensive doctrine ("soul sleep"), adds the concept of "no subjective passage of time" (not stated in any verse), and applies the unconsciousness observations to the entire intermediate state. Individual passages describe aspects; this claim unifies them into a complete position. | #5 (systematizing), #1 (adds "no subjective time" concept) |
| I2 | 2 Cor 5:8 and Phil 1:23 teach a conscious intermediate state between death and resurrection where believers are present with Christ | I-B | ECT-direction | FOR: E35 (2 Cor 5:4,8): Paul is willing to be "absent from the body, present with the Lord." E36 (Phil 1:23): Paul desires "to depart and be with Christ." AGAINST: E35 also records Paul desiring to be "clothed upon, not unclothed" (2 Cor 5:4) -- rejecting dying in favor of transformation. The vocabulary "mortality swallowed up of life" (2 Cor 5:4) matches "death swallowed up in victory" (1 Cor 15:54) -- resurrection vocabulary. E44 (1 Thess 4:16-17): Paul's explicit teaching ties being with the Lord to the resurrection. E49 (Acts 2:29,34): David, a righteous man, has not ascended to heaven. N4: being with the Lord is at resurrection. N7: righteous dead not yet rewarded. | E35 and E36 express Paul's preference but do not describe the intermediate state or its mechanism. Paul explicitly rejects dying in favor of transformation ("not unclothed, but clothed upon"). From the perspective of the sleeper, death and resurrection would be experienced as simultaneous. Paul's own explicit teaching (1 Thess 4:16-17) ties being with the Lord to the resurrection. The claim that these passages teach a conscious intermediate state requires reading Paul's preference as a doctrinal description of the intermediate state. | #2 (choosing between preference-expression vs. intermediate-state-description readings), #4b (extending Paul's preference language into doctrinal claim without verified SIS connection) |
| I3 | Luke 23:43 teaches the thief and Jesus entered paradise on the day of crucifixion, demonstrating consciousness after death | I-B | ECT-direction | FOR: E37 (Luke 23:43): "Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise." The standard English punctuation places "today" with "be with me." AGAINST: E37 also notes Greek has no punctuation. E50 (John 20:17): Jesus says "I am not yet ascended to my Father" on resurrection morning. E56 (Acts 2:27,31): Jesus' soul was in hades between death and resurrection. Both readings of the Greek are grammatically valid: (a) "I say unto thee, today thou shalt be with me in paradise"; (b) "I say unto thee today, thou shalt be with me in paradise." | One reading (a) conflicts with John 20:17 (Jesus not yet ascended) and Acts 2:27,31 (Jesus in hades). The other reading (b) is consistent with all other E-items. The claim depends on editorial punctuation not present in the Greek text, which makes it an inference requiring a choice between two valid parsings. | #2 (choosing between two grammatically valid parsings), Gate 2 of Tree 3 (punctuation absent from original) |
| I4 | Luke 16:19-31 teaches the literal geography of the afterlife: conscious torment in hades and conscious bliss in Abraham's bosom | I-C | ECT-direction | E38 (Luke 16:19-31): the parable depicts the rich man in torments and Lazarus in Abraham's bosom, with a gulf between them, and the climactic line "they have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them." E38 is classified Neutral because the passage is parabolic (Gate 1 and Gate 3 of Tree 3 fail). No other Scripture describes "Abraham's bosom" as a conscious intermediate location, a compartmentalized hades, or conversations across a gulf. The passage's stated teaching point (v.29-31) concerns listening to Moses and the prophets. | The claim treats parabolic imagery as geographical/doctrinal description of the afterlife. The passage's own climax is about hearing Moses and the prophets, not about afterlife geography. "Abraham's bosom" as a location and compartmentalized hades are not attested elsewhere in Scripture. The claim requires treating parabolic elements as literal doctrine -- an external hermeneutical framework. | #3 (external framework: treating parabolic imagery as literal afterlife geography), Gate 3 failure in Tree 3 |
| I5 | Rev 6:9-11 teaches that the souls of dead martyrs are consciously present in heaven, aware of earthly events, and communicating with God | I-C | ECT-direction | E39 (Rev 6:9-11): in an apocalyptic vision, John sees souls under the altar who cry "How long?" and are told to rest. E39 is classified Neutral because the passage is apocalyptic vision (Gate 1 and Gate 3 of Tree 3 fail). Gen 4:10 uses the same personification pattern: Abel's blood "crieth" from the ground without being literally conscious. Revelation uses personification extensively (trees clap hands, beasts speak, harlot rides beast). | The claim treats apocalyptic vision imagery as a literal description of the dead's state. The passage is in a genre (apocalyptic vision) where all interpreters recognize symbolic elements. The blood-of-Abel parallel (Gen 4:10) shows that "crying out" imagery does not require literal consciousness. The claim requires treating apocalyptic personification as literal consciousness -- an external hermeneutical framework. | #3 (external framework: treating apocalyptic personification as literal description), Gate 1 and Gate 3 failures in Tree 3 |
| I6 | 1 Sam 28 proves the dead are conscious because Samuel appeared and spoke to Saul | I-C | ECT-direction | E40 (1 Sam 28:11-19): an apparition identified as Samuel speaks to Saul through a medium, a practice forbidden by God (Deut 18:10-12; 1 Chr 10:13-14). E40 is classified Neutral because the genre is narrative of a prohibited practice (Gate 3 consideration) and harmony conflicts with didactic passages on death-state (Gate 4). | The claim derives doctrine about the state of the dead from a necromantic seance that the Bible itself prohibits. Whether the apparition was genuinely Samuel, a demonic impersonation, or a divine exception is debated. Deriving doctrine from a prohibited practice requires importing the assumption that what occurs in a forbidden ritual represents genuine spiritual reality. | #3 (external framework: assuming prohibited practices yield reliable spiritual information), #1 (adds concept that what appears in necromancy represents reality) |
| I7 | The Transfiguration proves Moses was consciously alive after death | I-C | ECT-direction | E41 (Matt 17:3,9): Moses and Elijah appear talking with Jesus. Jesus calls it "the vision." Elijah was translated bodily (2 Ki 2:11). Jude 9 references contention over Moses' body. Even if Moses were literally present, he is a unique case (possible special resurrection). | The claim extends a unique supernatural event (which Jesus himself calls a "vision") involving unique subjects (one translated, one possibly resurrected) to draw conclusions about the normal state of the dead. This requires treating a vision of unique cases as normative for all dead people. | #3 (external framework: treating unique cases as normative), #4b (extending from unique subjects to all dead without textual warrant) |
| I8 | 1 Pet 3:18-20 teaches Christ descended to the underworld and preached to dead humans between his death and resurrection | I-C | ECT-direction | E42 (1 Pet 3:18-20): Christ, "quickened by the Spirit, by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison, which sometime were disobedient in the days of Noah." E43 (1 Pet 1:10-11): "the Spirit of Christ which was in them [the prophets]." 1 Pet 1:10-11 establishes that the Spirit of Christ was active through OT prophets. Reading 1 Pet 3:19 as "by the Spirit, he preached through Noah to the antediluvians" uses the same hermeneutical key Peter provides in 1:10-11. The "spirits in prison" are those who were disobedient in Noah's day and are now dead (in the prison of death). | The claim reads "went and preached" as a literal descent to the underworld, but: (a) the preaching was "by the Spirit" (the same Spirit active in OT prophets per 1 Pet 1:10-11); (b) the audience is specifically the antediluvians (not all the dead); (c) no other passage describes Christ preaching to dead humans between death and resurrection. The descent reading requires importing the concept of a literal underworld preaching mission not stated elsewhere in Scripture. | #3 (external framework: importing harrowing-of-hell concept), #1 (adds concept of post-death evangelism not found in text) |
| I9 | The "under the sun" qualifier in Ecclesiastes limits all death-state statements to an earthly perspective, invalidating them as evidence about the actual state of the dead | I-C | ECT-direction | E2 (Ecc 9:5): "the dead know not any thing" -- the phrase "under the sun" appears in v.6, not v.5. E4 (Ecc 9:10): "no work, device, knowledge, wisdom in the grave." E1 (Ps 146:4), E7 (Ps 6:5), E8 (Ps 115:17), E9 (Ps 88:10-12), E10 (Ps 30:9), E11 (Job 14:10-12), E12 (Job 14:21), E13 (Job 3:17-18), E18 (Isa 38:18-19) -- these are from Psalms, Job, and Isaiah, not Ecclesiastes. | The claim applies the "under the sun" qualifier to passages outside Ecclesiastes. Even within Ecclesiastes, the qualifier appears in v.6, not v.5. More importantly, the same death-state observations are made by authors in Psalms (6:5; 30:9; 88:10-12; 115:17; 143:3; 146:4), Job (3:17-18; 7:9-10; 14:10-12,21; 17:13-16; 34:14-15), and Isaiah (38:18-19). These authors do not use the "under the sun" framework. The claim requires extending a qualifier from one author (Solomon) to six or more other authors. | #3 (external framework: applying one author's literary device to other authors), #4b (extending Ecclesiastes qualifier without textual warrant) |

### I-B Resolution: I2 -- 2 Cor 5:8 and Phil 1:23 Teach a Conscious Intermediate State

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E35 (2 Cor 5:4,8: absent from body, present with Lord), E36 (Phil 1:23: depart and be with Christ)
- AGAINST: E35 also records Paul rejecting disembodiment ("not unclothed, but clothed upon" -- 2 Cor 5:4). 2 Cor 5:4 shares vocabulary with 1 Cor 15:54 ("mortality swallowed up"). E44 (1 Thess 4:16-17: being with Lord at resurrection). E45 (1 Cor 15:53-54: immortality at resurrection). E49 (Acts 2:29,34: David not ascended). E52 (Heb 11:39-40: heroes not yet received promise). N4 (being with Lord at resurrection). N7 (righteous dead not yet rewarded).

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E35 (2 Cor 5:4,8) | Contextually Clear | Paul expresses preference and desire. The context (v.4) explicitly rejects disembodiment. The passage describes Paul's preference, not the intermediate state. |
| E36 (Phil 1:23) | Contextually Clear | Paul's desire to depart and be with Christ. No time indicator between departure and being with Christ. Expression of preference. |
| E44 (1 Thess 4:16-17) | Plain | Paul's direct didactic teaching about how and when believers are with the Lord: at the resurrection and catching up. This is Paul teaching doctrine, not expressing personal preference. |
| E45 (1 Cor 15:53-54) | Plain | Paul's didactic teaching: immortality is put on at the resurrection. |
| E49 (Acts 2:29,34) | Plain | Peter's apostolic sermon: David has NOT ascended to heaven. Directly addresses the question of where a righteous dead person is. |
| E52 (Heb 11:39-40) | Plain | Direct didactic statement: the heroes died without receiving the promise. |
| N4 | Plain derivative | Being with the Lord is tied to resurrection (derived from E44, E45, E47, E48, E50, E51). |
| N7 | Plain derivative | Righteous dead not yet rewarded (derived from E49, E52, E53). |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 2 Contextually Clear items (E35, E36), both expressing preference.
AGAINST: 4 Plain items (E44, E45, E49, E52) plus 2 Plain-derivative N-items (N4, N7). Paul's own didactic teaching (1 Thess 4:16-17), Peter's didactic sermon (Acts 2:29,34), and Hebrews' didactic statement (11:39-40) all directly address the timing of being with the Lord and the state of the righteous dead.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Paul's preference language (2 Cor 5:8; Phil 1:23) must be read in light of his own explicit teaching about the timing of being with the Lord (1 Thess 4:16-17). Same author, same topic, shared vocabulary (being "with the Lord"/"with Christ"). 1 Thess 4:17 explicitly states WHEN being with the Lord occurs: at the resurrection and catching up. From a sleeper's perspective, death and resurrection are experienced as simultaneous -- there is no subjective gap. Paul's preference to "depart and be with Christ" is consistent with the next conscious moment after death being the resurrection, at which point he IS with Christ.

2 Cor 5:4 explicitly states Paul does NOT want to be "unclothed" (to die) but "clothed upon" (resurrection body). This within-passage evidence argues against reading 2 Cor 5:8 as describing a conscious disembodied intermediate state.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
Plain didactic statements from Paul (1 Thess 4:16-17; 1 Cor 15:53-54), Peter (Acts 2:29,34), and Hebrews (11:39-40) on the AGAINST side vs. Contextually Clear preference-expressions from Paul on the FOR side. The plain governs the contextually clear. The same author who writes 2 Cor 5:8 and Phil 1:23 also writes 1 Thess 4:16-17, which explicitly ties being with the Lord to the resurrection. Clear governs unclear. Master I007 (already registered in etc-01 with same resolution).

---

### I-B Resolution: I3 -- Luke 23:43 Teaches Paradise on Crucifixion Day

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E37 (Luke 23:43): standard English punctuation places "today" with "be with me in paradise."
- AGAINST: E50 (John 20:17): Jesus says "I am not yet ascended to my Father" on Sunday morning. E56 (Acts 2:27,31): Jesus' soul was in hades between death and resurrection. If paradise = God's presence, Jesus was not there on Friday.

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E37 (Luke 23:43) | Ambiguous | Greek has no punctuation. Both parsings are grammatically valid. The meaning depends entirely on comma placement, which is editorial. Gate 2 of Tree 3 fails. |
| E50 (John 20:17) | Plain | Jesus' direct statement on resurrection morning: "I am not yet ascended to my Father." No ambiguity. |
| E56 (Acts 2:27,31) | Plain | Peter's apostolic sermon: Jesus' soul was in hades. No ambiguity. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 1 Ambiguous item (E37, ambiguous because of absent punctuation).
AGAINST: 2 Plain items (E50, E56), one from Jesus himself and one from Peter's sermon.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
John 20:17 and Acts 2:27,31 determine the reading of Luke 23:43. If Jesus was in hades (not paradise) between death and resurrection, and if Jesus had not yet ascended on Sunday morning, then Reading 1 ("today thou shalt be with me in paradise") creates a direct contradiction. Reading 2 ("I say unto thee today, thou shalt be with me in paradise") is consistent with all passages: Jesus promises today (on the cross), the thief will be with Jesus in paradise (at the restoration). The plain passages govern the ambiguous one.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
2 Plain items on the AGAINST side vs. 1 Ambiguous item on the FOR side. The Ambiguous item (dependent on editorial punctuation) cannot override Plain statements from Jesus himself and Peter's sermon. Master I008 (already registered in etc-01 with same resolution).

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases Scripture. Checked.
- Each uses plain lexical meaning without adding concepts. Checked.
- E-items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Checked.
- Items that state what both sides accept (textual observations, genre identifications) are classified Neutral.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- All items classified Conditionalist have full Tree 3 documentation.
- 12 items classified Conditionalist were documented in prior studies (etc-01) with all four gates passed.
- 7 new Conditionalist items (E14/E144, E15/E145, E16/E146, E20/E147, E21/E148, E31/E153, E49/E162) have full Tree 3 documentation above with all four gates passed.
- No E-items classified as ECT. Luke 16:19-31 (E38/E155) fails Gate 1 (parabolic character) and Gate 3 (parabolic genre). Rev 6:9-11 (E39/E156) fails Gate 1 (symbolic figure) and Gate 3 (apocalyptic genre). 1 Sam 28 (E40/E157) fails Gate 3 (narrative of prohibited practice) and Gate 4 (harmony conflict). Matt 17 (E41/E158) fails Gate 3 (vision per Jesus' own word).
- All neutral E-items are textual observations both sides accept.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- Each N-item follows unavoidably from cited E-items. Checked.
- Three N-tier tests applied to each. All pass (documented above).
- N1/N004 (dead unconscious) classified Conditionalist because one side must qualify these statements.
- N4/N018 (being with Lord at resurrection) classified Conditionalist because ECT must add inference-level passages to qualify these plain didactic statements.
- N7/N021 (righteous dead not yet rewarded) classified Conditionalist because ECT must qualify Peter's and Hebrews' direct statements.
- N2/N006, N3/N017, N5/N019, N6/N020 are Neutral because both sides accept the textual observations.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1 (soul sleep): All components in E/N tables except "no subjective time" -> mostly text-derived, but adds a concept -> I-A still valid (criterion #5 systematizing plus #1 add). Checked.
- I2 (2 Cor 5:8/Phil 1:23 = conscious intermediate state): E/N items on both sides -> text-derived -> I-B. Checked.
- I3 (Luke 23:43 = paradise that day): E/N items on both sides -> text-derived -> I-B. Checked.
- I4 (Luke 16 = literal afterlife): External framework (parable-as-doctrine) -> I-C. Checked.
- I5 (Rev 6:9-11 = conscious souls): External framework (apocalyptic-as-literal) -> I-C. Checked.
- I6 (1 Sam 28 = conscious Samuel): External framework (prohibited practice as doctrine) -> I-C. Checked.
- I7 (Transfiguration = conscious Moses): External framework (unique case as normative) -> I-C. Checked.
- I8 (1 Pet 3:18-20 = underworld preaching): External framework (harrowing of hell) -> I-C. Checked.
- I9 ("under the sun" invalidates death-state texts): External framework (extending one author's qualifier) -> I-C. Checked.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value -> aligns -> I-A. Checked.
- I2: Requires Paul's preference language to describe a state (intermediate consciousness) that his didactic passages do not teach -> conflicts -> I-B. Checked.
- I3: Requires "today" to attach to "be with me" when the Greek allows both parsings -> conflicts with E50 (John 20:17) -> I-B. Checked.
- I4: Does not directly override E38 (acknowledges the parable says what it says) -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I5: Does not directly override E39 (acknowledges the vision says what it says) -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I6: Does not directly override E40 (acknowledges the narrative says what it says) -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I7: Does not directly override E41 (acknowledges the vision says what it says) -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I8: Does not directly override E42 (acknowledges the text says what it says) -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I9: Does not directly override any E-item but attempts to limit the scope of E1-E21 -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.

**Step E: Consistency checks.**
- I-A (I1): Requires #5 (systematizing) and #1 (adds concept). I-A check: requires only #5 and optionally #4a; #1 is borderline. The added concept ("no subjective time") is a logical consequence of unconsciousness, so this is closer to systematizing than adding. Confirmed I-A.
- I-B (I2, I3): Both have E/N items on BOTH sides. Confirmed.
- I-C (I4-I9): None overrides an E/N statement. Confirmed.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- Paul's preference language (2 Cor 5:8; Phil 1:23) interpreted by Paul's didactic teaching (1 Thess 4:16-17; 1 Cor 15:53-54): same author, shared vocabulary ("with the Lord"/"with Christ"; "mortality swallowed up"). #4a verified.
- Luke 23:43 interpreted by John 20:17 and Acts 2:27,31: same Gospel author (Luke records both the thief and Acts 2); shared subject (Jesus' location after death). #4a verified.
- Acts 2:29,34 (David not ascended) applied to death-state question: Peter's direct teaching about a specific dead person. #4a verified.
- 1 Pet 1:10-11 (Spirit of Christ in prophets) applied to 1 Pet 3:19 (preached by the Spirit): same author, same concept (Spirit of Christ operating through OT figures). #4a verified.
- "Under the sun" qualifier applied to non-Ecclesiastes passages: no verified textual connection between Ecclesiastes and Psalms/Job/Isaiah. #4b (inference trigger). Checked.

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture Explicitly States or Necessarily Implies)

1. The dead's thoughts perish in that very day (Ps 146:4). The dead know not any thing (Ecc 9:5). There is no work, device, knowledge, or wisdom in the grave (Ecc 9:10). In death there is no remembrance of God (Ps 6:5). The dead praise not the LORD; they go down into silence (Ps 115:17). The dead dwell in the land of forgetfulness and darkness (Ps 88:12; Job 10:21-22). The dead man's sons come to honour and he knows it not (Job 14:21). At least eight authors across six or more OT books make these statements.

2. Death is called "sleep" by at least seven biblical authors: Moses/God (Deut 31:16), Job (7:21; 14:12), Jeremiah (51:39), Daniel (12:2), Jesus (John 11:11; Matt 9:24), Luke (Acts 7:60), and Paul (1 Cor 15:6,18,51; 1 Thess 4:13-15). Jesus deliberately equates "sleep" with "dead" (John 11:11-14) and calls a dead girl "sleeping" (Matt 9:24; Mark 5:39; Luke 8:52). The sleep metaphor implies unconsciousness, rest, and future awakening (resurrection).

3. Being "with the Lord" is tied to the resurrection and second coming: "The dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive... shall be caught up... and so shall we ever be with the Lord" (1 Thess 4:16-17). Jesus says he will raise believers "at the last day" (John 6:39,40,44,54). Martha expects resurrection "at the last day" and Jesus does not correct the timing (John 11:24). Jesus says "I will come again, and receive you unto myself" (John 14:3).

4. David, a righteous man, "is not ascended into the heavens" (Acts 2:34). He is "both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day" (Acts 2:29). This is an apostolic sermon statement about a specific named person.

5. The OT heroes "died in faith, not having received the promises" (Heb 11:13). They "received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect" (Heb 11:39-40). The crown of righteousness is given "at that day" -- the day of Christ's appearing (2 Tim 4:8).

6. Sheol (67 OT occurrences) and hades (11 NT occurrences) are semantically equivalent (the LXX translates sheol as hades; Acts 2:27,31 directly demonstrates this). Both righteous and wicked go to sheol. Sheol is characterized by no work, no knowledge, no wisdom (Ecc 9:10), no praise (Ps 6:5; 115:17), silence (Ps 115:17), and darkness (Job 10:21-22). Hades is temporary: death and hades deliver up the dead and are cast into the lake of fire (Rev 20:13-14).

7. On resurrection morning, Jesus says he has not yet ascended to the Father (John 20:17). His soul was in hades between death and resurrection (Acts 2:27,31).

8. The dead who die in the Lord "rest from their labours" (Rev 14:13). Daniel shall "rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days" (Dan 12:13). The righteous enter "peace" and "rest in their beds" (Isa 57:2).

## What CANNOT Be Said (Not Explicitly Stated or Necessarily Implied by Scripture)

1. **It cannot be said that 2 Cor 5:8 or Phil 1:23 describes a conscious intermediate state.** Paul expresses willingness (2 Cor 5:8) and desire (Phil 1:23), but neither passage describes the intermediate state or its mechanism. Paul explicitly rejects dying in favor of transformation ("not unclothed, but clothed upon," 2 Cor 5:4) -- "unclothed" (*ekdysasthai*) means to die, not to enter a conscious disembodied state. The unique compound verb *ependyomai* (G1902, only 2x in NT) means "to put on over" -- receiving the resurrection body over the mortal body, i.e., transformation without death. The purpose clause "mortality swallowed up of life" shares vocabulary with 1 Cor 15:54 (*katapino*), confirming the resurrection context. The groaning of 2 Cor 5:2,4 (*stenazomen*, G4727) matches Rom 8:23, where its object is explicitly "the redemption of our body." Paul's own explicit teaching on being with the Lord (1 Thess 4:16-17) ties it to the resurrection, not to death. See [Study 19](../etc-19-2-corinthians-5-intermediate-state/CONCLUSION.md) for detailed Greek analysis.

2. **It cannot be said that Luke 23:43 teaches the thief went to paradise that day.** The Greek text has no punctuation. The standard English comma placement is editorial, not textual. One reading conflicts with John 20:17 (Jesus not yet ascended) and Acts 2:27,31 (Jesus in hades). The other reading is consistent with all other passages.

3. **It cannot be said that Luke 16:19-31 teaches the literal geography of the afterlife.** The passage is a parable (in a series of parables, Luke 15-16). "Abraham's bosom" as a location for the dead is not attested elsewhere in Scripture. The passage's own teaching point (v.29-31) is about hearing Moses and the prophets.

4. **It cannot be said that Rev 6:9-11 teaches dead martyrs are consciously present in heaven.** The passage is an apocalyptic vision in a genre where all interpreters recognize symbolic elements. The blood-of-Abel parallel (Gen 4:10) shows "crying out" imagery does not require literal consciousness. The "souls" are told to "rest" -- death vocabulary.

5. **It cannot be said that 1 Sam 28 teaches the dead are conscious.** The passage narrates a forbidden practice (necromancy, condemned in Deut 18:10-12; 1 Chr 10:13-14). Deriving doctrine about the state of the dead from a condemned practice contradicts the biblical prohibition against consulting the dead.

6. **It cannot be said that the Transfiguration proves consciousness after death.** Jesus himself calls this "the vision" (Matt 17:9). Elijah never died (2 Ki 2:11). Moses may have been specially resurrected (Jude 9). This is a unique supernatural event involving unique subjects, not a description of the normal state of the dead.

7. **It cannot be said that 1 Pet 3:18-20 teaches Christ preached to dead humans between death and resurrection.** Peter himself states "the Spirit of Christ was in them" (the OT prophets, 1 Pet 1:10-11). The preaching was "by the Spirit" to those who were disobedient "in the days of Noah." The most natural reading is that Christ, through the Spirit, preached via Noah to the antediluvians, who are now in the prison of death.

8. **It cannot be said that the "under the sun" qualifier invalidates the OT death-state passages.** The same observations about the unconsciousness of the dead are made by authors in Psalms, Job, and Isaiah -- none of whom use the "under the sun" framework. Even within Ecclesiastes, "under the sun" appears in 9:6, not 9:5.

9. **It cannot be said that any OT passage describes sheol as a place of conscious activity in a didactic context.** Isaiah 14:9-10 is a mashal (taunt-poem, v.4) using extensive personification. Ezekiel 32:17-32 is prophetic lamentation poetry. Both use standard Hebrew poetic personification. The didactic description of sheol (Ecc 9:10; Ps 6:5; 115:17) characterizes it as unconscious, silent, and dark.

10. **It cannot be said that the righteous dead are currently in heaven.** Peter explicitly states David "is not ascended into the heavens" (Acts 2:34). Hebrews states the heroes "received not the promise" and "they without us should not be made perfect" (11:39-40).

## Analysis

### The OT Death-State: Consistent Testimony of Unconsciousness

The Old Testament contains a sustained, consistent testimony about the state of the dead. At least eight authors across six or more books describe the dead as unconscious, unable to think, praise, remember, or participate in any activity.

David states the dead have no remembrance of God and cannot give thanks (Ps 6:5), cannot praise (Ps 30:9), and go down into silence (Ps 115:17). Solomon states the dead know nothing, have no more reward, and their love, hatred, and envy have perished (Ecc 9:5-6), and that there is no work, device, knowledge, or wisdom in the grave (Ecc 9:10). The psalmist of 146 states thoughts perish on the day of death (Ps 146:4). Heman the Ezrahite states God's wonders are not known in the dark or the land of forgetfulness (Ps 88:10-12). Job states the dead man's sons come to honour and he knows it not (Job 14:21), and that in death the wicked cease from troubling, the weary are at rest, prisoners hear not the voice of the oppressor (Job 3:17-18). Hezekiah states the grave cannot praise, death cannot celebrate (Isa 38:18-19). Isaiah states the righteous enter peace and rest (Isa 57:1-2). Elihu states that if God gathers spirit and breath, all flesh perishes (Job 34:14-15).

No OT passage contains a didactic statement that the dead are conscious. Isaiah 14:9-10, which depicts the rephaim "speaking" in sheol, is identified in the text itself as a mashal (taunt-poem, v.4) and uses extensive personification (trees rejoicing, sheol being moved). Ezekiel 32 is prophetic lamentation poetry using the same devices. These are literary personification, not doctrinal descriptions of conscious afterlife.

### Death as Sleep: The Metaphor and Its Implications

The death-as-sleep metaphor is used by at least seven different biblical authors spanning the entire canon. The implications of sleep are well defined: sleeping people are unconscious, at rest, inactive, and awaiting awakening. These properties map precisely onto the OT descriptions of the dead.

Jesus deliberately endorses the metaphor. In John 11:11-14, he says "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth" and then clarifies "Lazarus is dead." In three Synoptic accounts (Matt 9:24; Mark 5:39; Luke 8:52), he says a dead girl "sleepeth," and the mourners laughed "knowing that she was dead" (Luke 8:53). Jesus chose the sleep metaphor knowing the girl was dead. If the dead were actually conscious in another realm, calling death "sleep" would be misleading.

Paul uses koimao (G2837) consistently for the Christian dead: "fallen asleep" (1 Cor 15:6), "asleep in Christ" (1 Cor 15:18), "not all sleep" (1 Cor 15:51), "them which are asleep" (1 Thess 4:13), "sleep in Jesus" (1 Thess 4:14). His argument in 1 Cor 15:18 -- "if Christ be not raised, then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished" -- is significant. If the dead were already consciously with Christ, they would NOT have "perished" even without resurrection. Paul's argument requires that the dead are not yet with Christ; their hope depends entirely on resurrection.

### The Alleged Conscious Intermediate State Passages

This study examined all eight passages commonly cited for consciousness between death and resurrection. Each was analyzed for genre, context, grammatical features, and consistency with the broader biblical testimony.

**2 Cor 5:8 and Phil 1:23** express Paul's preference but do not describe the intermediate state. Paul explicitly rejects disembodiment (2 Cor 5:4). The unique compound verb *ependyomai* (G1902, only 2x in NT) means "to put on over" -- receiving the resurrection body over the mortal body. Paul's shared vocabulary with 1 Cor 15:54 ("mortality swallowed up," *katapino* G2666) identifies the context as resurrection. His groaning (*stenazomen* G4727 in 5:2,4) uses the same verb and form as Rom 8:23, where its object is "the redemption of our body." His own didactic teaching (1 Thess 4:16-17) ties being with the Lord to the resurrection. See [Study 19](../etc-19-2-corinthians-5-intermediate-state/CONCLUSION.md) for comprehensive Greek analysis of this passage.

**Luke 23:43** depends on editorial punctuation absent from the Greek. One reading conflicts with John 20:17 and Acts 2:27,31; the other is consistent with all other passages.

**Luke 16:19-31** is a parable in a parabolic series (Luke 15-16). Its imagery ("Abraham's bosom," compartmentalized hades, conversations across a gulf) is not attested elsewhere in Scripture as literal afterlife geography. Its own climax (v.29-31) teaches about hearing Moses and the prophets.

**Rev 6:9-11** is an apocalyptic vision in a genre where all interpreters recognize symbolic elements. The blood-of-Abel parallel (Gen 4:10) shows "crying out" does not require literal consciousness. The souls are told to "rest."

**1 Sam 28** narrates a forbidden practice. Deriving doctrine from necromancy contradicts the biblical prohibition against consulting the dead.

**Matt 17:1-9** is called "the vision" by Jesus himself (v.9). Elijah never died. Moses may have been specially resurrected (Jude 9). This is a unique event involving unique subjects.

**1 Pet 3:18-20** describes preaching "by the Spirit" to those disobedient "in the days of Noah." Peter himself establishes that the Spirit of Christ was in the OT prophets (1 Pet 1:10-11). The most natural reading is preaching through Noah.

**2 Cor 12:2-4** describes a living person's visionary experience and tells nothing about the state of the dead.

### Sheol/Hades: The Abode of the Unconscious Dead

Sheol (67 OT occurrences) and hades (11 NT occurrences) are the abode of all the dead. The LXX confirms their semantic equivalence by translating sheol as hades. Acts 2:27,31 directly demonstrates this: Peter quotes Ps 16:10 (sheol) using hades.

Sheol's characteristics from didactic passages: no work, no device, no knowledge, no wisdom (Ecc 9:10); no remembrance, no thanksgiving (Ps 6:5); silence (Ps 115:17); darkness (Job 10:21-22; 17:13); forgetfulness (Ps 88:12); rest (Job 3:17; Isa 57:2); dust (Job 17:16; 7:21).

Both righteous and wicked go to sheol (Jacob: Gen 37:35; the wicked: Ps 9:17; David: Ps 16:10; Korah: Num 16:33). Sheol is not a divided realm with conscious sections -- it is the common grave, characterized by unconsciousness.

Hades in the NT is temporary: Rev 20:13-14 shows hades delivering up the dead and being cast into the lake of fire. Hades is a holding state ended by resurrection. Only Luke 16:23 depicts consciousness in hades -- within a parable.

### Resurrection as the Hope

The consistent biblical hope for the dead is resurrection, not an intermediate state. The dead "sleep in the dust" and will "awake" (Dan 12:2; Isa 26:19). Being with the Lord occurs at the resurrection (1 Thess 4:16-17). Immortality is put on at the resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54). Believers are raised "at the last day" (John 6:39,40,44,54). Martha expected resurrection "at the last day" and Jesus did not correct the timing (John 11:24). Jesus promises "I will come again and receive you unto myself" (John 14:3). The crown of righteousness is given "at that day" -- Christ's appearing (2 Tim 4:8). The heroes of faith "received not the promise" and are not yet "made perfect" (Heb 11:39-40). David "is not ascended into the heavens" (Acts 2:34).

### Cross-Study Integration

This study confirms and extends findings from prior studies:
- **etc-01** established the anthropological framework: man became a living soul (Gen 2:7), death reverses creation, thoughts perish, the dead know nothing, death = sleep. This study investigates these findings in depth, demonstrating the breadth (8+ authors, 6+ books) and consistency of the OT death-state testimony, and systematically examining every alleged counter-passage.
- **etc-02** established that God alone has immortality, mortals put it on at resurrection, eternal life is conditional. This study adds: the dead have not yet received their reward (Heb 11:39-40; Acts 2:34; 2 Tim 4:8), confirming that the righteous dead are not yet in their final state.
- **etc-03** established what death means: cessation, reversal of creation, same vocabulary for all types of death. This study adds: the state of the dead confirms the meaning of death -- if death means cessation (etc-03), the dead should be unconscious. That is precisely what the death-state passages describe.

## Conclusion

This study examined 66 explicit statements, 7 necessary implications, and 9 inferences regarding the state of the dead between death and resurrection.

19 explicit statements describe the dead as unconscious, in darkness, silence, or sleep, or state that a righteous person (David) has not ascended to heaven (classified Conditionalist). 0 explicit statements describe the dead as conscious in a didactic context (no ECT E-items identified). The four passages that describe apparent consciousness among the dead (Luke 16:19-31, Rev 6:9-11, 1 Sam 28, Matt 17:1-9) all fail one or more gates of Tree 3 (parabolic genre, apocalyptic genre, prohibited practice narrative, or vision per Jesus' own word) and are classified Neutral.

3 necessary implications are classified Conditionalist (the dead are unconscious; being with the Lord is at resurrection; righteous dead not yet rewarded). 4 are neutral (death reverses creation; sleep implies unconsciousness/rest/awakening; sheol/hades is common destination; hades is temporary).

1 inference (I-A) extends the explicit evidence, systematizing soul sleep as a doctrine. 2 inferences (I-B) present competing textual claims about 2 Cor 5:8/Phil 1:23 and Luke 23:43; both resolved Strong toward the Conditionalist reading via SIS protocol (confirming etc-01 resolutions). 6 inferences (I-C) are compatible external frameworks (Luke 16 as literal afterlife, Rev 6:9-11 as conscious souls, 1 Sam 28 as conscious dead, Transfiguration as conscious Moses, 1 Pet 3:18-20 as underworld preaching, "under the sun" invalidation of death-state texts).
