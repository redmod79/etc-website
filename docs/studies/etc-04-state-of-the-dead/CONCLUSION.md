## 1. EXPLICIT STATEMENTS (E Tier)

### Items Already in Master Evidence File

The following E items from the master file are directly cited in this study. "Also In" fields updated in master.

| Master ID | Explicit Statement | Reference | Classification |

| E015 | "For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?" | Psa 6:5 | Conditionalist |
| E016 | The grave is called "the land of forgetfulness"; the dead do not arise and praise, lovingkindness not declared in the grave, faithfulness not in destruction, wonders not known in the dark. | Psa 88:10-12 | Conditionalist |
| E017 | "The dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten." | Ecc 9:5 | Conditionalist |

| E038 | Paul describes being "absent from the body" as being "present with the Lord" and calls this preferable. | 2 Cor 5:8 | Neutral |
| E039 | Paul expresses "a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better." | Phil 1:23 | Neutral |
| E047 | Jesus said "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth" and the narrator clarifies "Howbeit Jesus spake of his death" and "Lazarus is dead." Jesus equates sleep with death. | Jhn 11:11-14 | Neutral |
| E049 | "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." (Stephen at death.) | Acts 7:59 | Neutral |
| E050 | "Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise." (Jesus to the thief.) | Luk 23:43 | Neutral |

| E052 | "The spirits of just men made perfect" are listed among the assembly of the heavenly Jerusalem. | Heb 12:23 | Neutral |
| E094 | "O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave...all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee." Job expresses a waiting posture in the grave until a future call. | Job 14:13-15 | Conditionalist |
| E095 | "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?" Qohelet treats the ultimate destination of the human and animal spirit as an open/uncertain question. | Ecc 3:21 | Neutral |
| E096 | Daniel is told: "thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days." The personal address frames Daniel's death as rest (sleep) until "the end of the days." | Dan 12:13 | Conditionalist |
| E097 | God told Moses: "thou shalt sleep with thy fathers." God himself uses sleep-language for Moses's death. | Deut 31:16 | Neutral |
| E098 | "Some are fallen asleep" (v.6); "they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished" (v.18); "firstfruits of them that slept" (v.20); "we shall not all sleep" (v.51). Paul consistently uses koimao for deceased believers throughout the resurrection chapter. | 1 Cor 15:6,18,20,51 | Neutral |
| E099 | "Them which are asleep" (v.13); "them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him" (v.14); "which are asleep" (v.15); "the dead in Christ shall rise first" (v.16).

| E120 | "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore... and have the keys of hell and of death." Christ was dead and is now permanently alive; he holds authority over death and Hades. | Rev 1:18 | Conditionalist |
| E123 | The rich man in Hades "lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom." He cried: "I am tormented in this flame." Abraham confirms: "thou art tormented." | Luk 16:23-25 | Neutral |
| E124 | "The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished." Those outside the first resurrection are described as "not living" during the millennium. | Rev 20:5 | Conditionalist |
| E082 | "They which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead... Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of the resurrection." The deathless state is explicitly post-resurrection, not the present state. | Luk 20:35-36 | Conditionalist |

### New Explicit Statements (this study — E128 onward)

| Study ID | Explicit Statement | Reference | Classification |
|----------|--------------------|-----------|----------------|
| E128 | "They also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished [apolonto]." Without resurrection, the dead in Christ have perished completely (apollumi, G622). | 1 Cor 15:18 | Conditionalist |
| E129 | "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them." The blessedness of the righteous dead is described as rest. | Rev 14:13 | Conditionalist |
| E130 | "The patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day." Peter's explicit statement that David remained dead and in his tomb (i.e., in hades) as of Pentecost. | Acts 2:29 | Conditionalist |
| E131 | "His soul was not left in hell [hades], neither his flesh did see corruption." Peter explicitly states Christ's soul was in hades between death and resurrection; the resurrection = the soul leaving hades. | Acts 2:31 | Conditionalist |
| E132 | "They shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts." | Jer 51:39 | Conditionalist |
| E133 | "There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor." In sheol, the dead do not hear. | Job 3:18 | Conditionalist |
| E134 | "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them; and they were judged every man according to their works." Hades holds the dead until the resurrection-judgment; they are then delivered up (from their held state) for judgment. | Rev 20:13 | Conditionalist |
| E135 | "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [sheol/hades]; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." The soul is in sheol at death; the hope is that God will not leave it there. | Psa 16:10 | Conditionalist |
| E136 | "David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep [ekoimēthē, G2837], and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption." | Acts 13:36 | Neutral |

## 2. NECESSARY IMPLICATIONS (N Tier)

### Items Already in Master Evidence File

The following N items are directly cited or confirmed in this study. "Also In" fields updated in master.

| Master ID | Necessary Implication | Based on | Classification |
|-----------|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| N004 | At death, the process of Gen 2:7 reverses: the breath/spirit returns to God (Ecc 12:7) and the dust returns to earth (Gen 3:19; Psa 104:29). | E002, E012, E046 | Conditionalist |
| N005 | God currently possesses immortality exclusively; no creature currently possesses it as an inherent attribute, according to 1 Tim 6:16. | E029, E054 | Conditionalist |
| N006 | Immortality (athanasia) is something mortals acquire at the resurrection, not at death or at birth. | E031, E032, E054, E055, E064, E082 | Conditionalist |
| N009 | Death is described as sleep in Jesus' own words and in Paul's consistent teaching across multiple epistles and in OT prophetic literature. | E047, E020, E023 | Neutral |
> **[RECLASSIFIED]** N009 was reclassified from Neutral (N-tier) to I-A Conditionalist, subsumed by IA007, after Study 17. All prose references to N009 should be read as IA007.
| N023 | The dead are explicitly described as lacking consciousness, thought, knowledge, praise, and participation in earthly affairs — consistently across multiple independent biblical authors. | E017, E018, E019, E013, E014, E015, E016, E022, E020, E021 | Conditionalist |
| N024 | Job 14:13-15 frames death as a state of unconscious waiting in the grave until a future call — not as a period of continued active existence. | E094, E020 | Conditionalist |

### New Necessary Implications (this study)

**N025 assessment:** Combining Acts 7:59 ("receive my spirit") with Acts 7:60 ("fell asleep") to conclude that spirit-commendation and sleep are compatible states — this requires inferring a logical connection between two sequential statements. It passes the universal agreement test (both ECT and conditionalist readers must acknowledge that Luke placed v.59 and v.60 in immediate sequence without any described intermediate conscious state) but the claim that this "demonstrates" compatibility of spirit-commendation with sleep as the resulting state requires one inference step. Classified as I-A (below), not N.

**N025 (revised):** The following passes all three N-tier tests:

| Study ID | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Classification |
|----------|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------|----------------|
| N025 | Between death and resurrection, the dead are in a state of "not living" — this is the explicit framework Revelation uses for the period between death and the first resurrection. | E124 (Rev 20:5: "the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished") | Rev 20:5 directly states that the dead "lived not again until" — the temporal frame "not living" covers the entire period between death and the first resurrection. Any reader must acknowledge this is what the text states about the pre-resurrection state of the dead. The only interpretive move that avoids this is redefining "lived" (ezesan) to mean something other than the same word in v.4 — but v.4 and v.5 use the identical word in parallel structure. | Conditionalist |
| N026 | Hades is a temporary holding state that (a) receives the dead at death, (b) holds them until resurrection, and (c) delivers them up at the resurrection and is then itself destroyed. | E131 (Acts 2:31: soul was in hades until resurrection); E134 (Rev 20:13: hades delivers up the dead); E110 (Rev 20:14: death and hades cast into lake of fire) | Three independent statements combine without any added concept: the soul goes to hades (Acts 2:31 via negative: "was not left"), hades holds the dead until judgment (Rev 20:13: "gave up the dead"), hades is abolished at judgment (Rev 20:14). Together these yield the model: hades = temporary holding → resurrection → abolition. All three statements are in E. No additional concept required. | Conditionalist |

## 3. INFERENCES (I Tier)

### I-A (Evidence-Extending) — Items Already in Master

The following I-A items are confirmed/extended by this study:

| Master ID | Claim | Confirmed By |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| IA005 | The state of the dead is one of complete unawareness — no thought, knowledge, or praise — until the resurrection. | Extended by E128 (1 Cor 15:18: without resurrection = perished), E129 (Rev 14:13: rest from labours), E133 (Job 3:18: hear not), N025 (Rev 20:5 framework), N026 (hades as temporary). |
| IA007 | The sleep metaphor for death implies unconsciousness in the intermediate state. | Extended by E132 (Jer 51:39: sleep a perpetual sleep, not wake), E136 (Acts 13:36: David fell on sleep), E129 (Rev 14:13: rest). |

### New I-A Items (this study)

| Study ID | Claim | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|----------|-------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| IA015 | The sequential structure of Acts 7:59-60 — spirit commended to God (v.59), then "fell asleep" (v.60) — demonstrates that within Luke's narrative framework, the act of committing one's spirit to God at the moment of death results in sleep, not in immediate conscious paradise-experience. | Acts 7:59 (E049: "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit") and Acts 7:60 (E100: "he fell asleep") are two consecutive statements at the moment of death. IB005 (the "spirit returns to God" inference that returns means conscious survival) is tested here: Luke, describing the same event, names the resulting state "sleep" (ekoimēthē). | No single verse states "spirit-commendation leads to sleep as the following state." The claim systematizes two consecutive verses and draws a conclusion about the relationship between the two events. | #5 (systematizing sequential verses); #4a (SIS: Acts 7:59-60 are in the same narrative, same moment — the clearer description of the outcome [sleep] governs the interpretation of the preceding [spirit-commendation]) | Conditionalist |

---

### I-B (Competing-Evidence) — Items Already in Master

The following I-B items receive their fullest treatment in this study. Full resolution analysis in Section 4.

| Master ID | Claim | Prior Resolution | This Study's Assessment |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| IB001 | The Bible teaches a conscious intermediate state for the righteous between death and resurrection. | Unresolved (three prior studies) | Full resolution analysis — see I-B Resolution section below |
| IB002 | The "dead know not any thing" language is limited to earthly affairs "under the sun." | Moderate — against qualifier | Confirmed; Hebrew grammar analysis (03-analysis.md) provides additional support: "under the sun" qualifier does not appear in Ecc 9:5 v.5 itself. |
| IB005 | "The spirit returns to God" (Ecc 12:7) means a conscious personal entity goes to God in awareness. | Moderate — toward life-force | Confirmed; Acts 7:59-60 (IA015) adds weight: spirit-commendation followed immediately by sleep in same narrative. |
| IB006 | Luke 16:19-31 is a literal historical account of the intermediate state. | Unresolved | See analysis in 03-analysis.md; genre indicators and stated purpose (v.31) assessed. Resolution unchanged: Unresolved. |
| IB007 | Luke 20:38 "all live unto him" = present conscious state of the dead. | Moderate — toward resurrection-certainty | Confirmed by this study; E082 (Luk 20:36, same discourse) governs via #4a SIS. No change. |

---

### New I-B Items (this study)

No new distinct I-B items are introduced. The 1 Cor 15:18 constraint (E128) is incorporated into the IB001 resolution below as additional AGAINST weight rather than as a separate I-B item.

---

### I-C (Compatible External) — Items Already in Master

| Master ID | Claim | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| IC001 | The "absent from body, present with Lord" language describes an instantaneous subjective experience from the dead person's perspective (no interval in unconscious sleep), not an objectively continuous intermediate conscious state. | Confirmed. Compatible with all E/N. This reading resolves the 2 Cor 5:8/Phil 1:23 texts consistently with the sleep-of-death framework without overriding any E/N statement. |

---

### New I-C Items (this study)

| Study ID | Claim | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria | Classification |
|----------|-------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------------|
| IC002 | The parallel structure of Rev 14:11 (wicked: "no rest day or night") and Rev 14:13 (righteous dead: "rest from their labours") indicates that rest is the definitive characteristic of the dead in the Lord's condition between death and resurrection — in contrast to the wicked's unceasing torment. | Rev 14:11 (E) describes those who worship the beast as having "no rest day nor night." Rev 14:13 (E129) describes the righteous dead as receiving "rest from their labours." | No single verse states "rest is the intermediate state of the righteous." The comparison of the two adjacent verses requires the inference step of reading them as deliberate parallels. Does not contradict any E/N statement. | #3 (applying literary context: parallel structure in adjacent verses); #5 (systematizing two adjacent E items into a doctrinal point) | Conditionalist |

---

### I-D (Counter-Evidence External) — Items Already in Master

| Master ID | Claim | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| ID001 | Humans possess an immortal soul that survives death and continues in conscious existence. | Confirmed as I-D. Conflicts with E029/N005, E031/N006, E024/N007, E026/N008. No new items alter this classification. |
| ID002 | "The soul that sins shall die" refers only to physical death of the body, not any surviving soul. | Confirmed as I-D. Conflicts with E024, E028, E043, N007. |
| ID003 | "God alone has immortality" means pre-eminence, not exclusive possession. | Confirmed as I-D. Conflicts with E029, N005, E030/N012, E031/N006. |

## 4. I-B RESOLUTION SECTIONS

---

### I-B Resolution: IB001 — Conscious Intermediate State (FULL TREATMENT, Study 04)

**Background:** IB001 has been carried through three prior studies as Unresolved. This study provides its fullest examination. The prior Unresolved status was based on Plain statements on both sides.

---

**Step 1 — Tension:**

FOR the conscious intermediate state:
- E039 (Phil 1:23): Paul expresses "a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better." [Plain — direct personal statement connecting death with being with Christ]
- E050 (Luk 23:43): Jesus to the thief: "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise." [Plain in standard reading — direct speech of Jesus with "today" as temporal marker]
- E038 (2 Cor 5:8): "willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord." [Contextually Clear — v.4 tension present]
- E123 (Luk 16:22-25): The rich man in hades conscious in torments; Lazarus in Abraham's bosom. [Contextually Clear — genre uncertain]
- E051 (Rev 6:9-11): Souls under the altar crying out; told to rest. [Ambiguous — apocalyptic genre; OT blood-cry background]
- E052 (Heb 12:23): "Spirits of just men made perfect." [Ambiguous — teleioō timing uncertain; genre is paraenetic]

AGAINST the conscious intermediate state:
- E017 (Ecc 9:5): "The dead know not any thing." [Plain — direct declarative; Hebrew grammar: einam yodeʿim meumah = ongoing condition, no qualifier]
- E013 (Psa 146:4): "In that very day his thoughts perish." [Plain — "that very day" is an explicit timing marker; different author from Qohelet; different genre (poetry of trust); no qualifier]
- E020 (Job 14:12): "They shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep" until the eschatological end. [Plain — direct statement; duration: till the heavens be no more]
- E021 (Job 14:21): "He knoweth it not, he perceiveth it not." The dead person lacks awareness of the living. [Plain — direct present-tense declarative statement about the dead's knowledge; no qualifier]
- E082 (Luk 20:36): "Neither can they die any more... they are the children of the resurrection." The deathless state belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection. [Plain — Jesus's direct statement; didactic; scope = the resurrection state]
- E128 (1 Cor 15:18): "They also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished [apolonto]." Without resurrection, those who died in Christ have perished. [Plain — Paul's own statement within his resurrection argument; same author as E039/Phil 1:23]
- E124 (Rev 20:5): "The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished." [Plain — explicit negative with temporal scope: between death and resurrection = not living]
- N025 (New): Between death and resurrection, the dead are in a state of "not living" per Rev 20:5. [Necessary implication of E124]
- E129 (Rev 14:13): Righteous dead "rest from their labours." Rest = their state. [Plain in content — direct beatitude statement]
- E130 (Acts 2:29): David "is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day." [Plain — Peter's explicit statement that David remained in hades as of Pentecost, not in conscious paradise]
- E131 (Acts 2:31): "His soul was not left in hell [hades]" — fulfilled at the resurrection. [Plain — Peter's interpretation of Ps 16:10; soul was in hades until resurrection]
- E133 (Job 3:18): "They hear not the voice of the oppressor." [Plain — direct declarative]
- N023 (Master): Dead lack consciousness, thought, knowledge, praise — across multiple independent authors. [Necessary implication]
- N026 (New): Hades is a temporary holding state that delivers up the dead at the resurrection and is then abolished.

---

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

FOR items:

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E039 (Phil 1:23) | Plain | Direct personal expression by Paul connecting departing (death) with being with Christ; "far better" = valuative preference |
| E050 (Luk 23:43) | Plain (standard reading) | Direct speech of Jesus; "today" is an adverb in the standard reading; however, Greek text has no punctuation; Acts 2:31 (soul in hades) and Jhn 20:17 (not yet ascended Sunday) create a contextual complication that prevents this from being Plain without qualification |
| E038 (2 Cor 5:8) | Contextually Clear | V.4 explicitly states Paul does NOT want the naked/disembodied state; the v.4/v.8 tension requires contextual awareness; both readings (intermediate state vs. resurrection-state) are compatible with the Greek grammar |
| E123 (Luk 16:22-25) | Contextually Clear | The narrative contains conscious activity in hades; genre question (parable vs. literal) is the interpretive step; stated purpose (v.31: sufficiency of Scripture) is primary |
| E051 (Rev 6:9-11) | Ambiguous | Apocalyptic genre; OT blood-cry background (Gen 4:10: Abel's blood "cries" from the ground = literary figure); same group "lived" at first resurrection (Rev 20:4-5) suggesting they were not "living" before it |
| E052 (Heb 12:23) | Ambiguous | teleioō in Hebrews (11:40) frames "made perfect" as an eschatological completion event ("without us, they would not be made perfect"); paraenetic genre; the assembly described is the present spiritual identity of believers "in Christ," not a description of where dead people currently reside |

AGAINST items:

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E017 (Ecc 9:5) | Plain | Direct declarative; Hebrew grammar: ongoing condition, no qualifier in v.5; Qohelet is the author |
| E013 (Psa 146:4) | Plain | "That very day" = explicit timing; direct declarative; different author from Qohelet; no qualifier |
| E020 (Job 14:12) | Plain | Direct declarative; duration stated explicitly; different author from above two |
| E021 (Job 14:21) | Plain | Direct present-tense declarative; the dead person "knoweth it not, perceiveth it not" — no qualifier |
| E082 (Luk 20:36) | Plain | Jesus's direct didactic statement; deathless state = post-resurrection; same discourse as v.38 (IB007) |
| E128 (1 Cor 15:18) | Plain | Paul's direct statement within a formal theological argument (the resurrection chapter); the logical structure of the reductio requires "perished" to mean genuine destruction, not "still with Christ" |
| E124 (Rev 20:5) | Plain | Direct declarative; explicit temporal scope ("until the thousand years were finished"); same word ezesan in v.4 and v.5 in parallel structure |
| E129 (Rev 14:13) | Plain | Direct heavenly beatitude; "rest" is unambiguous sleep/rest vocabulary consistent with N009 |
| E130 (Acts 2:29) | Plain | Peter's explicit factual statement in a didactic speech; David is "dead and buried" and his sepulchre "is with us" = he remains in hades |
| E131 (Acts 2:31) | Plain | Peter's explicit interpretive statement; "his soul was not left in hades" = it was in hades; Peter identifies the resurrection as the event of leaving hades |
| E133 (Job 3:18) | Plain | Direct declarative; "hear not" = explicit negative of the dead's hearing |

---

**Step 3 — Weight:**

FOR side:
- 1 Plain item that is fully plain without contextual qualification: E039 (Phil 1:23). This is the single strongest FOR item — Paul directly connects departing with being with Christ.
- 1 item classified Plain in standard reading but complicated by contextual factors: E050 (Luk 23:43). The Acts 2:31 (soul in hades) and Jhn 20:17 (not yet ascended) complications mean this item carries less than full "Plain" weight — it is Plain in isolation but contextually complicated.
- 2 Contextually Clear items: E038 (2 Cor 5:8), E123 (Luk 16:22-25)
- 2 Ambiguous items: E051 (Rev 6:9-11), E052 (Heb 12:23)

AGAINST side:
- 11 Plain items: E017, E013, E020, E021, E082, E128, E124, E129, E130, E131, E133
- 2 Necessary implications: N023, N025, N026

The FOR side has effectively 1 unqualified Plain item (E039) and 1 contextually complicated Plain item (E050). The AGAINST side has 11 Plain items from at least eight independent authors (Qohelet, multiple psalmists, Isaiah/Hezekiah, Job, Jesus in Luke 20, Paul in 1 Cor 15, John in Rev 14 and Rev 20, Peter in Acts 2).

The disparity in quantity and independence of Plain items is significant. The FOR side's two strongest items (E039 and E050) face the following SIS constraints:

For E039 (Phil 1:23): Paul's own statement in 1 Cor 15:18 (E128, same author, formal theological argument) states that without resurrection, the dead in Christ have perished. If Paul believed they were already consciously with Christ (Phil 1:23 = immediate conscious paradise), then Paul's reductio in 1 Cor 15:18 loses its logical force. The more internally coherent reading of Phil 1:23: Paul connects death and being-with-Christ as the assured outcome of his death, but the timing of "being with Christ" is governed by the resurrection context of 1 Cor 15. Paul's comfort to the Thessalonians (1 Thess 4:13-18, E099) is the resurrection, not the intermediate state — consistent with this reading.

For E050 (Luk 23:43): Acts 2:31 (E131, same author Luke, same subject Jesus) explicitly states that Christ's soul was in hades between death and resurrection. Jhn 20:17 records Jesus on Sunday morning saying "I am not yet ascended to my Father." If "today in paradise" meant immediate conscious heavenly presence, these Lukan-authored and Johannine statements require explanation. The two possible readings of "today" — (a) temporal marker specifying the day of paradise-entry, or (b) Lukan emphatic "today" for present fulfillment (cf. Lk 4:21; 19:9) — are both grammatically valid. The Acts 2:31 complication weighs against reading (a) as unqualifiedly Plain.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**

**SIS #4a connections (verified):**

1. E128 (1 Cor 15:18) → E039 (Phil 1:23): Same author (Paul), both addressing the condition of deceased believers. 1 Cor 15:18 is in a formal theological argument (the resurrection chapter, the most systematic NT treatment of death and resurrection). Phil 1:23 is a personal expression of preference in a letter. The formal theological argument governs the personal expression when they appear to conflict. Clear passage (1 Cor 15:18: without resurrection = perished) governs the unclear timing implication of Phil 1:23.

2. E131 (Acts 2:31) → E050 (Luk 23:43): Same author (Luke), both addressing Jesus's post-death location. Acts 2:31 is Peter's explicit interpretive statement about where Christ's soul was. Luke 23:43 is a reported saying of Jesus. Luke himself (Acts 2:31, via Peter whom Luke quotes as authoritative) places Christ's soul in hades until resurrection. This governs the reading of "today in paradise": if paradise = Christ's immediate conscious location after death, Acts 2:31 (same Lukan narrative) contradicts it.

3. E082 (Luk 20:36) → E050 (Luk 23:43): Same author (Luke), same subject domain (state after death). Luk 20:36 (Plain, didactic, Jesus's own statement) says the deathless state belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection. Luke 23:43 must be read consistently with Luke 20:36.

4. E124 (Rev 20:5) → E051 (Rev 6:9-11): Same author (John), same subjects (martyrs "beheaded for the witness of Jesus" = same group in Rev 6:9 and Rev 20:4). Rev 20:5 explicitly states the rest of the dead "lived not again" until the end of the millennium. Rev 20:4 explicitly states the martyrs "lived" at the first resurrection. The framework: between death and resurrection = not living. This governs the reading of Rev 6:9-11: the "souls under the altar" are in the state of "not living" and will "live" at the resurrection.

**SIS result:** The clearer, didactic, formally argued, and multi-author Plain passages on the AGAINST side govern the reading of the potentially ambiguous timing in the FOR items. The FOR items describe expected outcomes (E039: Phil 1:23 — the death-to-Christ-connection), divine declarations (E050: Luk 23:43 — paradise promise), or apocalyptic visions (E051: Rev 6:9-11). The AGAINST side has 11 Plain didactic and declarative statements from independent authors across both testaments.

---

**Step 5 — Resolution: MODERATE (weight AGAINST conscious intermediate state)**

**Rationale for Moderate rather than Strong:**

A "Strong" resolution would require only Ambiguous items on the FOR side. The FOR side has E039 (Phil 1:23) which in isolation is a Plain statement connecting death with being with Christ, and E050 (Luk 23:43) which in the standard reading is a plain statement about "today" in paradise. These items prevent the resolution from being "Strong" — they are genuine textual evidence.

A "Moderate" resolution reflects: (a) significant Plain weight on the AGAINST side from multiple independent authors; (b) the SIS #4a connections that determine the reading of the FOR items; (c) the internal Pauline coherence problem (1 Cor 15:18 vs. Phil 1:23 from the same author); (d) the Lukan complication (Acts 2:31 vs. Luk 23:43 in the same author's corpus); (e) the Rev 20:4-5 framework governing Rev 6:9-11 in the same author's work.

**Shift from prior studies:** IB001 was Unresolved across etc5-01, etc5-02, and etc5-03. This study's new evidence adds:
- E128 (1 Cor 15:18: without resurrection = perished — Plain AGAINST, same author as E039)
- E129 (Rev 14:13: rest from labours — Plain AGAINST)
- E130 (Acts 2:29: David dead and buried — Plain AGAINST)
- E131 (Acts 2:31: soul in hades until resurrection — Plain AGAINST, same author as E050)
- IA015 (Acts 7:59-60: spirit-commendation followed by sleep in same narrative)
- N025 (Rev 20:5 framework: not living between death and resurrection)
- N026 (Hades = temporary holding state)

The additional 4 Plain AGAINST items and the 2 SIS #4a connections governing the two strongest FOR items shift the resolution from Unresolved to Moderate toward AGAINST.

**IB001 Resolution: Moderate — weight against conscious intermediate state.**

---

### I-B Resolution: IB002 — "Under the sun" qualifier on Ecc 9:5

**Status: Confirmed from prior studies — Moderate (against the qualifier).**

This study adds: Hebrew morphological analysis (raw-data/hebrew-parsing.md) confirms that "under the sun" in v.6 is grammatically absent from v.5. V.5's "einam yodeʿim meumah" (not knowing anything) has no qualifier. The qualifier in v.6 restricts participation in earthly affairs, not knowledge/consciousness in v.5. The grammatical evidence strengthens the prior Moderate resolution.

**IB002 Resolution: Moderate — weight against the qualifier. Confirmed.**

---

### I-B Resolution: IB005 — "Spirit returns to God" = conscious survival

**Status: Confirmed from prior studies — Moderate (toward life-force reading).**

This study adds: IA015 (Acts 7:59-60: spirit-commendation followed immediately by sleep). Acts 7:59 uses the same commendation-of-spirit language as Luk 23:46 and Ecc 12:7. Acts 7:60 immediately describes the resulting state as sleep (koimao). Luke (the author of Acts) does not describe an intermediate conscious state following the spirit's departure; he describes sleep. This adds weight to the life-force reading of the "spirit returns to God."

**IB005 Resolution: Moderate — toward life-force returning to source. Confirmed and strengthened.**

---

### I-B Resolution: IB006 — Rich Man and Lazarus as literal account

**Status: Unresolved. No new evidence changes this.**

The genre question (parable vs. literal) cannot be resolved by the text itself. The stated purpose (v.31: sufficiency of Moses and the prophets) is the primary message. The physical impossibility elements and parabolic opening formula are noted. The conflict with plain state-of-death passages (E017, E020) remains. IB001's shift to Moderate adds indirect weight to the parabolic reading (if the dead are not conscious in the intermediate state, a literal intermediate-conscious-hades reading requires additional qualification). But the genre question is not resolved by IB001's resolution.

**IB006 Resolution: Unresolved. Unchanged.**

---

### I-B Resolution: IB007 — Luke 20:38 "all live unto him" = present consciousness

**Status: Confirmed from prior studies — Moderate (toward resurrection-certainty reading).**

No new evidence in this study. The governing constraint (E082, same discourse, same chapter, v.36: deathlessness belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection) via SIS #4a remains. Jesus's argument in Luke 20 is FOR resurrection; "all live unto him" is Jesus's summary of why the covenant guarantees resurrection, not a description of the patriarchs' present conscious state.

**IB007 Resolution: Moderate — toward resurrection-certainty. Confirmed.**

---

## 5. VERIFICATION PHASE

### Step A — Verify Explicit Statements

Each new E item (E128–E136) is a direct quote or close paraphrase of actual verse text:
- E128: Direct quote (1 Cor 15:18 "fallen asleep in Christ are perished"). ✓
- E129: Direct quote (Rev 14:13 "rest from their labours"). ✓
- E130: Direct quote (Acts 2:29 "dead and buried, sepulchre with us"). ✓
- E131: Direct quote (Acts 2:31 "his soul was not left in hell"). ✓
- E132: Direct quote (Jer 51:39 "sleep a perpetual sleep, not wake"). ✓
- E133: Direct quote (Job 3:18 "hear not the voice of the oppressor"). ✓
- E134: Direct quote (Rev 20:13 "hades delivered up the dead"). ✓
- E135: Direct quote (Ps 16:10 "not leave my soul in hell"). ✓
- E136: Direct quote (Acts 13:36 "fell on sleep, saw corruption"). ✓

Note on E128 classification: E098 (master) includes 1 Cor 15:18 in the koimao-series and is classified Neutral. E128 is a NEW separate explicit statement about the SAME verse, extracting the "perished" (apollumi) statement as a distinct claim. E098 = "Paul uses koimao in v.18" (Neutral, grammatical observation). E128 = "without resurrection the dead in Christ have perished" (Conditionalist, doctrinal assertion). These are different observations about the same verse — both are E-tier, neither is a duplicate of the other.

### Step B — Verify Necessary Implications

- N025: Based on E124 (Rev 20:5). "Lived not again until" = temporal frame of not-living between death and resurrection. Universal agreement test: both ECT and conditionalist readers must acknowledge this is what Rev 20:5 states about the pre-resurrection state of those outside the first resurrection. No interpretation required: ezesan (lived) in v.4 and v.5 are the same word in parallel structure; the negative in v.5 ("lived not") sets the frame. ✓
- N026: Based on E131 (Acts 2:31), E134 (Rev 20:13), E110 (Rev 20:14, master). The three E statements together yield the hades-model without adding concepts. ✓

### Step C — Verify I Classifications (Source Test)

- IA015: Strip away systematization. Components: Acts 7:59 (E049), Acts 7:60 (E100). Both in E tables. Text-derived. ✓ (I-A, not I-C)
- IC002: Components include Rev 14:11 (E) and E129 (new E item). Both in E tables. But the inference step (reading the two verses as deliberate parallels) adds a literary-context judgment. Classified I-C because the literary parallel is an observation about the text's structure, not the simple combination of two E statements. ✓ (I-C)

### Step D — Verify I Classifications (Direction Test)

- IA015 requires no E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value. ✓ (aligns = I-A)
- IC002 adds the parallel-reading framework. ✓ (compatible external = I-C)

### Step E — Run Consistency Checks

- IA015: Requires #5 (systematizing sequential verses) and #4a (SIS within same narrative). Does not require #1, #2, or #3. ✓ (properly I-A)
- IC002: External framework (literary parallel). Does not override any E/N statement. ✓ (properly I-C)
- IB001 has E/N items on both sides. ✓
- IB002, IB005, IB006, IB007 all have E/N items on both sides. ✓
- All I-D items override at least one E/N statement. ✓

### Step F — Verify SIS Connections

SIS #4a connections used in IB001 resolution:
1. E128 → E039: Same author (Paul), formal argument governs personal expression. Shared vocabulary: koimao, Christ, death. ✓
2. E131 → E050: Same author (Luke), same subject (Christ's post-death location). Direct referent overlap. ✓
3. E082 → E050: Same author (Luke), same subject domain. Same discourse (Luke 20 governs via IB007; Luke 23 via Luk 20's teaching). ✓
4. E124 → E051: Same author (John), same referent group (martyrs). Vocabulary: souls of them beheaded for witness of Jesus. ✓

All #4b cross-references properly treated as inference triggers. ✓

## 8. WHAT CAN BE SAID / WHAT CANNOT BE SAID

### What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

**About the state of the dead:**
1. The dead "know not any thing" — unqualified declarative across multiple independent OT authors (E017, E013, E020, E021, E014, E015, E016, E022, E133; N023).
2. On the day of death, the dead person's thoughts perish (E013).
3. The dead do not praise God, give thanks, declare his lovingkindness, or communicate with the living (E014, E015, E016, E022).
4. The dead person does not know what happens among the living (E021: "he knoweth it not, he perceiveth it not").
5. Death is described as sleep by Jesus, Paul, God (speaking of Moses), Daniel (speaking of himself), and OT authors — across every genre and both testaments (E047, E023, E096, E097, E098, E099, E100, E136, E132; N009, reclassified to IA007 after Study 17).
6. The blessedness of the righteous dead is characterized as "rest from their labours" — rest, not conscious activity (E129).
7. Between death and resurrection, the dead are "not living" (E124; N025).
8. Hades/sheol receives all the dead, holds them until resurrection, and is itself abolished at the final judgment (E131, E134, E110; N026).
9. The soul/spirit is in hades at death; resurrection is the event of leaving hades (E131, E135).
10. David remained dead and buried ("sepulchre is with us") as of Pentecost — he was not in conscious paradise (E130).

**About immortality and resurrection:**
11. God alone currently has immortality (athanasia) — it is not a present human possession (E029, N005).
12. Immortality is something mortals "put on" at the resurrection, not at death (E031, E032, N006).
13. The deathless state belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection, not to those who have merely died (E082).
14. Without resurrection, the dead in Christ have "perished" (apollumi) — the resurrection is essential to their post-death existence (E128).

**About the conscious intermediate state claim:**
15. The "spirit returns to God" who gave it (Ecc 12:7); the act of committing one's spirit to God (Acts 7:59) is followed immediately by "fell asleep" (Acts 7:60) in the same narrative (IA015).
16. The same Pauline author (Paul) who says to depart is to be with Christ (Phil 1:23) also says that without resurrection the dead in Christ have perished (1 Cor 15:18) — these come from the same author.
17. The "today in paradise" promise (Luk 23:43) is in the same Lukan narrative that explicitly places Christ's soul in hades until the resurrection (Acts 2:31).
18. The "souls under the altar" (Rev 6:9-11) are the same group as those who "lived" at the first resurrection (Rev 20:4) — they were "not living" before that resurrection event per Rev 20:5.

---

### What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture)

1. Scripture does not explicitly state that the dead are in conscious paradise between death and resurrection. The texts cited for this (Phil 1:23; 2 Cor 5:8; Luk 23:43) use language that is compatible with multiple readings and must be read alongside competing Plain passages.

2. Scripture does not state that the "under the sun" qualifier in Ecc 9:6 restricts the knowledge-statement in Ecc 9:5. V.5 has no such qualifier.

3. Scripture does not state that "the spirit returns to God" (Ecc 12:7) means the personal conscious individual survives and exists consciously in God's presence. The same ruach is applied to animals (Ecc 3:19-21) and its return to God is described by the same author as an open question ("who knoweth?" — Ecc 3:21).

4. Scripture does not state that sheol or hades is a place of conscious blessed experience for the righteous. All OT descriptions of sheol describe it as dark, silent, inactive, and cut off from God.

5. Scripture does not state that the Rich Man and Lazarus narrative is a literal description of the intermediate state. The text does not self-identify as a literal account; its stated purpose is the sufficiency of Scripture (v.31).

6. Scripture does not state that the Transfiguration demonstrates an ongoing conscious intermediate state. The event is classified as a "vision" (horama) by Matthew 17:9; Elijah did not die; Moses's appearance is most consistently read as a resurrection appearance given Jude 1:9 (Michael contested over Moses's body).

7. Scripture does not state that "all live unto him" (Luk 20:38) means the patriarchs are presently conscious. Within the same discourse, Jesus states that deathlessness belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection (v.36).

8. Scripture does not state that committing one's spirit to God at death initiates an immediately conscious intermediate existence. Luke's own narrative shows spirit-commendation (Acts 7:59) followed by sleep (Acts 7:60).
