# etc-04: State of the Dead -- Topic Organization

## Study Question
What is the state of the dead between death and resurrection -- conscious or unconscious? Examine ALL Old Testament death-state passages, ALL New Testament death-as-sleep passages, and ALL alleged conscious intermediate state passages.

## Series Context
- **etc-01** (72 items): Man became a living soul (Gen 2:7), death reverses creation (Ecc 12:7), thoughts perish at death (Ps 146:4), the dead know nothing (Ecc 9:5), the soul can die (Ezek 18:4) and be destroyed (Matt 10:28), man does not inherently possess immortality. Death described as sleep by 7+ authors. Being with the Lord tied to resurrection (1 Thess 4:16-17).
- **etc-02** (60 items): God alone has immortality (1 Tim 6:16), mortals must put it on at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54), eternal life conditional on Christ, no NT passage applies immortality vocabulary to the human soul.
- **etc-03** (50 items): Death = reversal of creation (dust to dust, spirit to God), cessation of cognitive activity, death entered through Adam, death and life as exhaustive alternatives, same vocabulary for physical/spiritual/second death.

## Topic Areas (A-F)

### A. OT Death-State Passages: The Dead Are Unconscious (19 passages)
The Old Testament consistently describes the dead as unconscious, unable to think, praise, remember, or participate in any activity. Multiple authors (David, Solomon, Job, Isaiah, Hezekiah) across multiple centuries make these statements.

**Key themes:** No remembrance, no praise, no knowledge, silence, darkness, forgetfulness, thoughts perish, dust returns.
