## PART A: UNCONSCIOUSNESS / SILENCE OF THE DEAD

### Ecclesiastes 9:1-12 — Context of the "dead know not any thing" statement

Ecclesiastes 9:1 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, [are] in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred [by] all [that is] before them.
Ecclesiastes 9:2 All [things come] alike to all: [there is] one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as [is] the good, so [is] the sinner; [and] he that sweareth, as [he] that feareth an oath.
Ecclesiastes 9:3 This [is] an evil among all [things] that are done under the sun, that [there is] one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness [is] in their heart while they live, and after that [they go] to the dead.
Ecclesiastes 9:4 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
**Ecclesiastes 9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.**
**Ecclesiastes 9:6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any [thing] that is done under the sun.**
Ecclesiastes 9:7 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.
Ecclesiastes 9:8 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.
Ecclesiastes 9:9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that [is] thy portion in [this] life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.
**Ecclesiastes 9:10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do [it] with thy might; for [there is] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.**
Ecclesiastes 9:11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race [is] not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.
Ecclesiastes 9:12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so [are] the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.

**Cross-testament parallels for Ecc 9:5 — OT:** Samuel_II 19:7 (0.388 — alive, die, know, neg); Isa 26:14 (0.356 — alive, die, mention); Ecc 2:16 (0.356 — die, forget, neg); Ecc 4:2 (0.373 — alive, die)
**Cross-testament parallels for Ecc 9:5 — NT:** MAT 10:39 (0.307 — alive); JAS 4:14 (0.295 — alive, know); 1JN 3:14 (0.294 — alive, know); ROM 6:9 (0.278 — die, know)
**Note:** No NT parallel scores above 0.31; the concept has no direct NT counterpart by semantic matching. The top NT parallels are on "alive/know" from a life-vs-death contrast, not on the specific "dead know nothing" formulation.

### Ecclesiastes 3:17-22 — Man as beast at death; spirit goes where?

Ecclesiastes 3:17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time there for every purpose and for every work.
Ecclesiastes 3:18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
**Ecclesiastes 3:19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity.**
**Ecclesiastes 3:20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.**
**Ecclesiastes 3:21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?**
Ecclesiastes 3:22 Wherefore I perceive that [there is] nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

**Note:** v.21 is a rhetorical question expressed with skepticism — "who knoweth?" — not an affirmation. The Hebrew mi yodea ("who knows?") is the same skeptical form as 2:19; 6:12; 8:1. The contrast with Ecc 12:7 (which definitively states the spirit returns to God) is significant: 3:21 is the earlier hesitation; 12:7 is the resolution.

### Ecclesiastes 12:1-7 — Spirit returns to God; the whole person dissolves

Ecclesiastes 12:1 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
Ecclesiastes 12:2 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:
Ecclesiastes 12:3 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,
Ecclesiastes 12:4 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;
Ecclesiastes 12:5 Also [when] they shall be afraid of [that which is] high, and fears [shall be] in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:
Ecclesiastes 12:6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
**Ecclesiastes 12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.**

**Note:** This is the resolution of Ecc 3:21. The spirit (ruach) "returns to God who gave it" — the return reversal of Gen 2:7 (God breathed the breath of life). The ruach is the divine animating power returned to its source; the dust returns to the ground. Together with Ps 146:4, these two texts form the clearest OT framework of what happens at death: the constituent elements dissociate, returning to their origins.

**Cross-testament parallels for Ecc 12:7 (via Ps 146:4):** Ps 146:4 parallels with Ecc 12:7 at 0.389 hybrid score — "both use return (shub) + ruach language in the context of death."

---

### Psalm 146:1-5 — "His thoughts perish" on the very day of death

Psalm 146:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
Psalm 146:2 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
Psalm 146:3 Put not your trust in princes, [nor] in the son of man, in whom [there is] no help.
**Psalm 146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.**
Psalm 146:5 Happy [is he] that [hath] the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope [is] in the LORD his God:

**Cross-testament parallels for Ps 146:4 — OT top:** Ecc 12:7 (0.389 — return, wind); Ecc 1:6 (0.382 — return, wind); Isa 32:15 (0.373 — wind); Job 7:7 (0.365 — return, wind)
**Cross-testament parallels for Ps 146:4 — NT top:** LUK 8:24 (0.337 — consume, wind); MRK 4:39 (0.327 — wind); JAS 1:11 (0.320 — consume)
**Note:** NT parallels are all below 0.34 and match only on "wind" (literal). The theological content — "thoughts perish at death" — has no NT parallel. The OT coherence is strong (Ecc 12:7; Job 7:7).

---

### Psalm 115:13-18 — "The dead praise not the LORD"

Psalm 115:13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, [both] small and great.
Psalm 115:14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
Psalm 115:15 Ye [are] blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
Psalm 115:16 The heaven, [even] the heavens, [are] the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
**Psalm 115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.**
Psalm 115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.

**Note:** v.17 uses two expressions: "the dead" (hammethim) and "those who go down into silence" (yordei dumah). Silence = the absence of praise, which requires consciousness. The living/dead contrast is stark: "we will bless" (v.18) vs. "the dead praise not" (v.17).

### Psalm 6:1-10 — "In death there is no remembrance of thee"

Psalm 6:1 To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Psalm 6:2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I [am] weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
Psalm 6:3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
Psalm 6:4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
**Psalm 6:5 For in death [there is] no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?**
Psalm 6:6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
Psalm 6:7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
Psalm 6:8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.
Psalm 6:9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
Psalm 6:10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return [and] be ashamed suddenly.

**Note:** "In death there is no remembrance" is the argument: the psalmist appeals to God to save him from death because in sheol there is no praise. The argument loses its force entirely if the dead are consciously praising God in an intermediate state. The logical structure of the petition depends on death = cessation of praise.

### Psalm 88:1-18 — The darkest psalm; the dead are "cut off" and in "forgetfulness"

Psalm 88:1 A Song [or] Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day [and] night before thee:
Psalm 88:2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
Psalm 88:3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
Psalm 88:4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man [that hath] no strength:
**Psalm 88:5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.**
Psalm 88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
Psalm 88:7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted [me] with all thy waves. Selah.
Psalm 88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: [I am] shut up, and I cannot come forth.
Psalm 88:9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
**Psalm 88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise [and] praise thee? Selah.**
**Psalm 88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? [or] thy faithfulness in destruction?**
**Psalm 88:12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?**
Psalm 88:13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
Psalm 88:14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? [why] hidest thou thy face from me?
Psalm 88:15 I [am] afflicted and ready to die from [my] youth up: [while] I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
Psalm 88:16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
Psalm 88:17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
Psalm 88:18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, [and] mine acquaintance into darkness.

**Note:** "The land of forgetfulness" (eretz neshiyah, v.12) is a unique OT phrase for sheol. The rhetorical questions of vv.10-12 all expect the answer "No" — the dead do NOT arise and praise, lovingkindness is NOT declared in the grave, wonders are NOT known in the dark. These are among the most explicit OT denials of post-mortem consciousness.

---

### Psalm 30:7-12 — Deliverance from the pit preserves praise

Psalm 30:7 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, [and] I was troubled.
Psalm 30:8 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
**Psalm 30:9 What profit [is there] in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?**
Psalm 30:10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
Psalm 30:11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
Psalm 30:12 To the end that [my] glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

**Note:** Same argument as Ps 6:5 — the psalmist appeals for deliverance by arguing that death = cessation of praise. "Shall the dust praise thee?" (v.9) — the answer expected is No. This is consistent with Ecc 9:5-10.

---

### Psalm 16:8-11 — "My flesh shall rest in hope... thou wilt not leave my soul in hell"

Psalm 16:8 I have set the LORD always before me: because [he is] at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Psalm 16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
**Psalm 16:10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.**
Psalm 16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence [is] fulness of joy; at thy right hand [there are] pleasures for evermore.

**Note:** Acts 2:25-31 applies this to Jesus's resurrection — "his soul was not left in hell [hades], neither his flesh did see corruption." The verse confirms that without resurrection, the soul IS in hades/sheol — it is only by resurrection (not by immediate transport) that one escapes it. The path of life and fulness of joy are eschatological, not immediate post-mortem experiences.

### Psalm 49:7-20 — "Man that is in honour... is like the beasts that perish"

Psalm 49:7 None [of them] can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
Psalm 49:8 (For the redemption of their soul [is] precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
Psalm 49:9 That he should still live for ever, [and] not see corruption.
Psalm 49:10 For he seeth [that] wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
Psalm 49:11 Their inward thought [is, that] their houses [shall continue] for ever, [and] their dwelling places to all generations; they call [their] lands after their own names.
Psalm 49:12 Nevertheless man [being] in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts [that] perish.
Psalm 49:13 This their way [is] their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
**Psalm 49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.**
**Psalm 49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.**
Psalm 49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
Psalm 49:17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
Psalm 49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and [men] will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
**Psalm 49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.**
Psalm 49:20 Man [that is] in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts [that] perish.

**Note:** v.14 — "like sheep they are laid in the grave" (shakab + sheol); v.15 — the exception for the righteous is divine redemption FROM sheol, not a conscious pleasant existence IN sheol. v.19 — "they shall never see light" describes the fate of the wicked in sheol.

## PART B: ISAIAH'S SHEOL IMAGERY

### Isaiah 38:9-20 — Hezekiah's song: the grave cannot praise

Isaiah 38:9 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:
Isaiah 38:10 I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
Isaiah 38:11 I said, I shall not see the LORD, [even] the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
Isaiah 38:12 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day [even] to night wilt thou make an end of me.
Isaiah 38:13 I reckoned till morning, [that], as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day [even] to night wilt thou make an end of me.
Isaiah 38:14 Like a crane [or] a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail [with looking] upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
Isaiah 38:15 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done [it]: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
Isaiah 38:16 O Lord, by these [things men] live, and in all these [things is] the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
Isaiah 38:17 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul [delivered it] from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
**Isaiah 38:18 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can [not] celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.**
Isaiah 38:19 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I [do] this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
Isaiah 38:20 The LORD [was ready] to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.

**Note:** v.18 is explicit: "the grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee." The contrast of v.19 ("the living, the living, he shall praise thee") reinforces the living/dead consciousness contrast. Hezekiah argues for healing precisely because sheol is a place of no praise.

---

### Isaiah 14:4-20 — Sheol stirs up the dead to mock the king of Babylon

Isaiah 14:4 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!
Isaiah 14:8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, [and] the cedars of Lebanon, [saying], Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.
**Isaiah 14:9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet [thee] at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, [even] all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.**
**Isaiah 14:10 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?**
**Isaiah 14:11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, [and] the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.**
Isaiah 14:15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
Isaiah 14:16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, [and] consider thee, [saying, Is] this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;
Isaiah 14:18 All the kings of the nations, [even] all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.
Isaiah 14:20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, [and] slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.

**Note:** The rephaim "speak" in v.10 — this is the most vivid OT passage depicting apparent post-mortem speech. However: (1) The genre is a taunt-song (mashal, v.4) — highly figurative/poetic; (2) The word rephaim (H7496) means "limp/slack ones" — the passage depicts them as weak, not as conscious blessed souls; (3) The kings "lie in glory" (v.18) = shakab imagery — the sleep of death; (4) Worms cover the king (v.11), not conscious existence. The most natural reading of this passage is that the "speaking" is poetic/personification — the same genre as Abel's blood "crying" in Gen 4:10.

**Isaiah 26:14 and 26:19 — Two contrasting resurrection statements:**
**Isaiah 26:14 [They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.**
**Isaiah 26:19 Thy dead [men] shall live, [together with] my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew [is as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.**

**Note:** v.14 uses rephaim (H7496) for the wicked dead: "they shall not live, they shall not rise." v.19 uses the same root for the righteous dead who WILL rise. The Hebrew contrast is exact: the wicked rephaim shall not arise; the righteous dead WILL arise. This reinforces that the current state of both groups (before resurrection) is the same non-arising state — the difference is in resurrection outcome, not in present conscious activity.

## PART C: JOB'S PERSPECTIVE ON DEATH

### Job 3:11-22 — Job wishes he had died at birth; death as rest

Job 3:11 Why died I not from the womb? [why] did I [not] give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
**Job 3:13 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,**
**Job 3:17 There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary be at rest.**
**Job 3:18 [There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.**
**Job 3:19 The small and great are there; and the servant [is] free from his master.**

**Note:** Death is described as rest (nuach, H5117), sleep (yashen, H3462), quietness — not as consciousness. "They hear not the voice of the oppressor" = non-hearing state. The wicked cease from troubling = cessation of activity.

---

### Job 14:1-22 — Man lies down and rises not; Job waits in sheol

**Job 14:10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where [is] he?**
**Job 14:11 [As] the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:**
**Job 14:12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens [be] no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.**
**Job 14:13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!**
**Job 14:14 If a man die, shall he live [again]? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.**
Job 14:15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
**Job 14:21 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth [it] not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth [it] not of them.**

**Note:** v.12 — "they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep" — the condition of death is called sleep from which there is no natural waking; only divine action raises them. v.13-14 — Job DESIRES to be hidden in sheol and wait there, inactive (sleeping/waiting), until resurrection. v.21 — "he knoweth it not... he perceiveth it not" — explicit statement that the dead lack current knowledge of the living.

---

### Job 17:1-16 — Sheol as Job's house and bed

Job 17:1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves [are ready] for me.
**Job 17:13 If I wait, the grave [is] mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.**
**Job 17:14 I have said to corruption, Thou [art] my father: to the worm, [Thou art] my mother, and my sister.**
**Job 17:16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when [our] rest together [is] in the dust.**

**Note:** Sheol = "mine house" and "bed" — sleep/rest imagery is predominant. The pit has "bars" (v.16) — a place of confinement, not freedom. "Rest together in the dust" = the inactive state.

---

## PART D: NT SLEEP-OF-DEATH PASSAGES

### John 11:1-14 — Jesus uses sleep as a synonym for death; disciples misunderstand

John 11:1 Now a certain [man] was sick, [named] Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
John 11:4 When Jesus heard [that], he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
**John 11:11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.**
**John 11:12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.**
**John 11:13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.**
**John 11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.**

**Note:** The disciples' misunderstanding confirms that koimao (sleep) in the death context was NOT automatically understood — Jesus had to clarify. John 11:13 explicitly glosses v.11: "he spake of his death." This is the NT's own explanation that the sleep-language means death, not literal sleep.

---

### Daniel 12:1-3, 13 — Sleepers in the dust of the earth awake at resurrection

**Daniel 12:1 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation [even] to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.**
**Daniel 12:2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt.**
Daniel 12:3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
**Daniel 12:13 But go thou thy way till the end [be]: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.**

**Cross-testament parallel context:** Dan 12:2 uses H3462 (yashen) — "sleepers of the dust of the earth." The resurrection is described as waking from sleep. Daniel himself is told to "rest" (shakab, H7901) until standing up "at the end of days" — rest throughout the intermediate period, with standing at the end.

**Note:** This is the clearest OT resurrection text. The dead are "sleeping in the dust" — not in a conscious intermediate state — and they AWAKE at resurrection. The sequence is: sleep (death) → awaking (resurrection). No intermediate conscious state is described.

---

### 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 — The dead "asleep in Jesus" rise at the Second Coming

**1 Thessalonians 4:13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.**
**1 Thessalonians 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.**
**1 Thessalonians 4:15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.**
**1 Thessalonians 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:**
**1 Thessalonians 4:17 Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.**
1 Thessalonians 4:18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

**Note:** Paul's comfort for grief over the dead is the resurrection, not a teaching that the dead are already consciously with the Lord. The "bringing with him" (v.14) = God bringing the sleeping ones through the resurrection event of vv.16-17. If they were already consciously with Christ, the resurrection of vv.16-17 would be redundant for their status. See Greek parsing notes on koimetheisas (Aor Pass Ptcp) for v.14.

### Acts 7:54-60 — Stephen "fell asleep" after committing his spirit

Acts 7:54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with [their] teeth.
Acts 7:55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
Acts 7:56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
Acts 7:59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon [God], and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
**Acts 7:60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.**

**Note:** v.59 — Stephen prays "receive my spirit" (a dying prayer, not a description of where he will be). v.60 — "he fell asleep" (ekoimeth, G2837 Aor Pass Ind). Luke uses koimao as the description of Stephen's death. The spirit-commendation (v.59) is a prayer at the moment of dying; the description of his state afterward is "fell asleep."

### Matthew 9:18-26 — "The maid is not dead, but sleepeth"

Matthew 9:23 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
**Matthew 9:24 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.**
Matthew 9:25 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.

**Note:** katheudo (G2518) is used here for literal sleep and for death. The crowd's scorn indicates they knew she was dead — Jesus's use of "sleep" was a deliberate metaphor (parallel Mk 5:39; Lk 8:52).

---

### Acts 13:34-37 — David "fell on sleep" and saw corruption; Christ did not

Acts 13:34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, [now] no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.
Acts 13:35 Wherefore he saith also in another [psalm], Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
**Acts 13:36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:**
Acts 13:37 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.

**Note:** Paul uses koimao (fell on sleep) for David. David's state: laid to his fathers + saw corruption. Christ's state: raised, did not see corruption. The contrast is between the common human fate (sleep + corruption) and resurrection-from-that-state.

## PART E: CONSCIOUS INTERMEDIATE STATE PASSAGES

### 2 Corinthians 5:1-10 — "Absent from the body, present with the Lord"

**2 Corinthians 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.**
**2 Corinthians 5:2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:**
**2 Corinthians 5:3 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.**
**2 Corinthians 5:4 For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.**
2 Corinthians 5:5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
2 Corinthians 5:6 Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
2 Corinthians 5:7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
**2 Corinthians 5:8 We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.**
2 Corinthians 5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
2 Corinthians 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.

**Cross-testament parallels for 2 Cor 5:8 — OT:** All below 0.29, no keyword matches. The concept is absent from OT.
**Cross-testament parallels for 2 Cor 5:8 — NT top:** 2CO 5:6 (0.541 — same passage, absent/body/confident/home); 2CO 5:9 (0.327); 1TH 4:17 (0.296 — "so shall we ever be with the Lord").

**Note:** v.4 is critical: Paul explicitly says he does NOT want to be "unclothed" (naked/disembodied, gymnos). His desire is to be "clothed upon" = resurrection body. The structure of vv.1-10 describes three states: (1) at home in body = away from Lord; (2) away from body = at home with Lord; (3) clothed upon = resurrection. Paul prefers (2) over (1), even though it involves the nakedness he doesn't want. The alternative interpretation: (2) = the resurrection-clothed state = Paul is describing resurrection as the "home with Lord" outcome, not an intermediate naked state. See Greek parsing for the aorist infinitives ekdemesai / endemesai.

### Philippians 1:18-26 — "To depart and be with Christ, which is far better"

Philippians 1:18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
Philippians 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
Philippians 1:20 According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.
**Philippians 1:21 For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.**
Philippians 1:22 But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
**Philippians 1:23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:**
Philippians 1:24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.
Philippians 1:25 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
Philippians 1:26 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.

**Cross-testament parallels for PHP 1:23 — OT:** All below 0.36, only "desire" and "two" match keywords. No OT parallel for the "depart and be with Christ" concept.
**Cross-testament parallels for PHP 1:23 — NT top:** ROM 9:3 (0.382 — christ, myself); PHP 1:21 (0.372 — same passage); 1CO 5:3 (0.285 — absent, body).

**Note:** The grammar does not specify when "being with Christ" follows "departing." See Greek parsing: analusai (depart) + einai sun Christō (to be with Christ) — the infinitives are linked without a temporal connector. IC001 (subjective time-collapse at death) is grammatically compatible; immediate conscious intermediate state is also compatible. The argument must be made from context, not grammar alone.

## PART F: SHEOL / HADES PASSAGES

### Luke 16:14-31 — The Rich Man and Lazarus parable

Luke 16:14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
Luke 16:19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
Luke 16:20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
**Luke 16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;**
**Luke 16:23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.**
**Luke 16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.**
**Luke 16:25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.**
**Luke 16:26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.**
Luke 16:27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
Luke 16:28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
**Luke 16:29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.**
Luke 16:30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
**Luke 16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.**

**Note:** The primary point of the narrative is v.31 — the sufficiency and authority of Scripture. All the narrative details (rich man, Lazarus, Abraham, flame, gulf) are the parabolic vehicle for the point of v.31. Jesus regularly uses parabolic frameworks drawn from contemporary beliefs (including the common Jewish teaching of two-compartment sheol, e.g., 1 Enoch) to make a single point — without necessarily endorsing all details as literal cosmology. The parallel NT passage found via cross-testament parallels: 1 Sam 28:15 top NT parallel is Luk 16:31, connecting the request to communicate across the death barrier (Saul/Samuel) with the refusal in Lk 16.

---

### 1 Samuel 28:3-25 — The witch of Endor; Samuel's apparent appearance

1 Samuel 28:3 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
1 Samuel 28:6 And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
**1 Samuel 28:12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou [art] Saul.**
**1 Samuel 28:14 And he said unto her, What form [is] he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he [is] covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it [was] Samuel, and he stooped with [his] face to the ground, and bowed himself.**
**1 Samuel 28:15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.**
1 Samuel 28:19 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow [shalt] thou and thy sons [be] with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.

**Cross-testament parallels for 1 Sam 28:15 — NT top:** LUK 16:31 (0.353 — even, prophet) — both passages involve attempted communication across death barrier; both result in rebuke/denial.

**Note:** The passage is unique — it cannot be taken as normative for the state of the dead because: (1) Necromancy is strictly forbidden (Deut 18:11; Lev 19:31); (2) The woman herself was terrified at what appeared (v.12), suggesting an extraordinary event; (3) Samuel describes being "disquieted" (disturbed) — not at peace in a blessed conscious state; (4) Whether it was actually Samuel or a demonic impersonation is disputed in the tradition; (5) The law's prohibition of this practice means God does not sanction consulting the dead — this is the strongest counter-argument to using this passage as evidence for conscious intermediate state.

## PART G: REVELATION PASSAGES ON THE DEAD

### Revelation 6:9-11 — "Souls under the altar" cry for vindication

**Revelation 6:9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:**
**Revelation 6:10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?**
**Revelation 6:11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they [were], should be fulfilled.**

**Cross-testament parallels for Rev 6:9 — OT top:** Leviticus 17:11 (0.321 — altar, soul) — "the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar."
**Cross-testament parallels for Rev 6:9 — NT top:** JHN 3:33 (0.410 — seal, testimony); REV 6:7 (0.407 — open, seal); REV 5:9 (0.362 — open, seal, slain).

**Note:** The OT background (Lev 17:11; Gen 4:10 — blood crying from ground) is critical. In the OT, the "life/soul" (nephesh) is in the blood; blood poured out at the altar = the life given. The martyrs' blood crying from under the altar is a direct continuation of Gen 4:10 (Abel's blood). The "souls under the altar" may represent the martyrs' blood crying for vindication (a well-established OT metaphor), not necessarily literal conscious disembodied entities. The response in v.11 is that they should "rest" — the rest language is consistent with sleep-of-death imagery.

---

### Revelation 20:4-6 — "Souls" that "lived and reigned" — first resurrection

**Revelation 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and [I saw] the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.**
**Revelation 20:5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This [is] the first resurrection.**
Revelation 20:6 Blessed and holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

**Note:** "They lived" (ezesan) at the first resurrection — this is explicitly the resurrection event. The "souls" of v.4 become living participants in the thousand-year reign. This is post-resurrection life, not a conscious intermediate state. v.5 — "the rest of the dead lived not again until..." confirms that the default state of the dead is not-living until resurrection.

---

### Revelation 14:11-13 — "Rest from their labours" for the righteous dead

Revelation 14:11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
Revelation 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
**Revelation 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed [are] the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.**

**Note:** The blessed state of the righteous dead is described as "rest from their labours" — not as conscious activity in paradise. The contrast with the wicked (v.11: "no rest day or night") highlights that rest is the promised state.

---

### Revelation 1:17-18 — Christ has keys of death and hades

Revelation 1:17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
**Revelation 1:18 [I am] he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.**

---

## PART H: TRANSFIGURATION AND RELATED PASSAGES

### Luke 9:28-36 — Moses and Elijah appear at the Transfiguration

Luke 9:28 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
**Luke 9:30 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:**
**Luke 9:31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.**
Luke 9:32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
Luke 9:33 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
Luke 9:34 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.

**Note:** Moses appears at the Transfiguration, yet Deut 34:5-6 records his death and burial. Elijah was taken without death (2 Ki 2). Both appeared in "glory" — which may indicate resurrection/transformation rather than a conscious intermediate state. Moses' appearance is difficult to explain regardless of one's view of the intermediate state; Jude 1:9 (the archangel contending for Moses' body) is often read as indicating Moses was resurrected. The Transfiguration appearance may be a unique divine action (a vision), not normative intermediate-state existence.

---

### Hebrews 12:18-24 — "Spirits of just men made perfect"

Hebrews 12:18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
Hebrews 12:22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
**Hebrews 12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,**
Hebrews 12:24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than [that of] Abel.

**Note:** "Spirits of just men made perfect" — pneumasin dikaiōn teteleiōmenōn. This describes the heavenly assembly the believer is constitutively joined to "in Christ." "Made perfect" (teteleiōmenōn, perfect passive participle) may indicate completion/perfection at resurrection, not current intermediate state existence. The context is the believer's present spiritual reality in Christ — access to the heavenly assembly — not a description of the dead's current condition.

---

## PART I: RESURRECTION / LIFE AFTER DEATH PASSAGES

### Luke 20:27-40 — "God is not a God of the dead, but of the living"

Luke 20:27 Then came to [him] certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
Luke 20:35 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
Luke 20:36 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
**Luke 20:37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.**
**Luke 20:38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.**

**Note:** "All live unto him" (v.38) — the present tense "live" is Jesus's argument for resurrection, not for conscious intermediate state. God's covenant relationship with the patriarchs is guarantor of their resurrection. The phrase does not state that they are currently conscious — it states that they are "unto him" (dative — in his reckoning/from his perspective they are alive, because he will raise them). Same logic as God calling things that are not as though they are (Rom 4:17).

---

### John 5:24-29 — "The hour is coming... all that are in the graves shall hear his voice"

**John 5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.**
John 5:25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
**John 5:28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,**
**John 5:29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.**

**Note:** v.28 — "all that are in the graves" (en tois mnēmeiois) shall hear and come forth. This affirms physical resurrection from graves, not from a conscious intermediate location. The "hour is coming" of v.28 is distinct from the "now is" of v.25 (spiritual resurrection) — v.28-29 is the eschatological physical resurrection.

---

### Acts 2:22-32 — Peter's Pentecost sermon: David in sheol until resurrection

Acts 2:24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
**Acts 2:27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.**
Acts 2:29 Men [and] brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
**Acts 2:31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.**
Acts 2:32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.

**Note:** Peter explicitly says David is "both dead and buried" (v.29) — present tense reality, contrasting with Christ who was raised. Ps 16:10 applied to David means David's soul IS in hades (the default state) — unlike Christ who was raised from it. This confirms that hades/sheol is the state of the dead until resurrection.

---

### 1 Corinthians 15:12-28 — If no resurrection, the dead have "perished"

1 Corinthians 15:12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
**1 Corinthians 15:18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.**
1 Corinthians 15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept.
**1 Corinthians 15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.**
**1 Corinthians 15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.**
1 Corinthians 15:26 The last enemy [that] shall be destroyed [is] death.

**Note:** v.18 is the critical logical argument: if no resurrection, then those who died in Christ "have perished" (apolonto). If a conscious blessed intermediate state were assumed, this reductio ad absurdum fails — one could say "they're with Christ anyway." Paul's argument requires that without resurrection, the dead in Christ have truly perished. The resurrection is therefore essential to their existence, not a supplement to an already-existing intermediate blessedness.

---

### Luke 23:39-47 — "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise"

Luke 23:39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
Luke 23:40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
Luke 23:41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
Luke 23:42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
**Luke 23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.**
Luke 23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
Luke 23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
**Luke 23:46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.**

**Cross-testament parallels for Luk 23:43 — OT:** All below 0.33, no keyword matches. No OT concept of "paradise" parallels this.
**Cross-testament parallels for Luk 23:43 — NT top:** JHN 1:51 (0.395 — truly); LUK 19:9 (0.391 — said, today); LUK 19:5 (0.385 — said, today); LUK 4:21 (0.375 — today).
**Note:** The NT parallels match primarily on "today" + "I say" — Jesus's affirmation formula (cf. Lk 4:21; 19:9). The thief's request was "when thou comest into thy kingdom" — a future eschatological request. Jesus's response connects "today" to "I say to you" (one reading) or to "you will be with me in paradise" (standard reading). See Greek parsing for the punctuation issue. See also: Jesus himself went to sheol/hades between death and resurrection (Acts 2:31) — if taken literally with standard punctuation, Jesus and the thief were both in paradise/sheol that same day, which complicates the "paradise = heaven/blessing" reading.

---

### Ezekiel 32:17-32 — Egypt and nations in sheol: all "lie uncircumcised"

Ezekiel 32:19 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
Ezekiel 32:21 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
Ezekiel 32:27 And they shall not lie with the mighty [that are] fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though [they were] the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

**Note:** Like Isa 14:9-10, the nations "speak" in sheol — but shakab (lie down, H7901) is the dominant verb throughout the passage. The speaking is embedded in a taunt/lament genre. The consistent picture is of the nations "lying down" in sheol — the sleep/death imagery predominates.

---

### Genesis 4:8-11 — Abel's blood "crieth" from the ground

Genesis 4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.

**Note:** The blood cries — not Abel as a conscious entity. This is the OT precedent for the "souls crying" language of Rev 6:9-10. In the OT, the blood/life poured out retains a metaphorical "cry" for justice, but this does not imply conscious ongoing existence of the person.
