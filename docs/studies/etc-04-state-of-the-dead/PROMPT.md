## Study Question

Condition of the dead -- conscious or unconscious? What happens between death and resurrection? Examine ALL Old Testament death-state passages (the dead know nothing, thoughts perish, no praise, silence, forgetfulness, sleep), ALL New Testament death-as-sleep passages, and ALL alleged conscious intermediate state passages (2 Cor 5:1-9, Phil 1:23, Luke 23:43, Luke 16:19-31, Rev 6:9-11, 1 Sam 28:3-20, Matt 17:1-9, 1 Pet 3:18-20). Examine the Hebrew and Greek "sleep" vocabulary (shakab H7901, yashen H3462, koimao G2837, katheudo G2518) and "rest/waiting" vocabulary. Investigate sheol (H7585) and hades (G86) as the abode of the dead.

## Series Context

This is study etc-04 in the "Final Fate of the Wicked" series.

**Prior studies:**
- etc-01-what-is-man (72 items) -- Established that man became a living soul (Gen 2:7), death reverses creation (Ecc 12:7), thoughts perish at death (Ps 146:4), the dead know nothing (Ecc 9:5), the soul can die (Ezek 18:4) and be destroyed (Matt 10:28), man does not inherently possess immortality. Death described as sleep by 7+ biblical authors. Being with the Lord tied to resurrection (1 Thess 4:16-17). I-B resolutions: 2 Cor 5:8/Phil 1:23 resolved Strong toward Conditionalist reading; Luke 23:43 resolved Strong toward Conditionalist reading.
- etc-02-who-has-immortality (60 items) -- Established that God alone has immortality (1 Tim 6:16), mortals must put it on at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54), eternal life is conditional on Christ (John 3:16; 1 John 5:11-12), the wages of sin is death (Rom 6:23), no NT passage applies immortality vocabulary to the human soul. Luke 20:38 classified I-C (does not teach present consciousness of patriarchs).
- etc-03-biblical-death (50 items) -- Established what death means: reversal of creation (dust to dust, spirit to God), cessation of cognitive activity, death entered through Adam's sin, death and life as exhaustive alternatives, same vocabulary for physical death/spiritual death/second death, second death = lake of fire. I-B resolutions: second death as ECT resolved Strong toward Conditionalist reading; "dead in trespasses" redefining death resolved Strong toward Conditionalist reading.
- Master evidence file: D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-master-evidence.md (182 items total across prior studies)

**This study's focus:** What is the STATE of the dead between death and resurrection? This is the central question: are the dead conscious or unconscious? Prior studies established WHAT man is (01b), WHO has immortality (02), and WHAT death means (03). This study now investigates the EXPERIENCE (or non-experience) of the dead. This includes: (a) all OT passages describing the condition of the dead, (b) all NT death-as-sleep passages, (c) all passages cited for a conscious intermediate state, (d) sheol/hades as the realm/state of the dead, (e) the sleep vocabulary, and (f) the alleged exceptions (Transfiguration, Witch of Endor, Rich Man and Lazarus, Souls under the altar, Spirits in prison).

**IMPORTANT:** Many death-state verses were already catalogued in prior studies (E011, E017-E022, E039-E045, E049-E056, etc.). This study must go DEEPER into these passages and also examine the alleged conscious intermediate state passages that were briefly noted in prior studies but not fully investigated. The key new contribution of this study is the systematic examination of BOTH sides of the question -- unconscious sleep AND alleged conscious intermediate existence -- with full I-B resolution where competing evidence exists.

### LXX Mappings (key connections):
- **H7585 (sheol)** maps to G86 (hades) in the LXX -- confirming semantic equivalence
- **H7901 (shakab)** used for death: "slept with his fathers" (1 Ki 2:10; 11:43; 14:20,31; 15:8,24; etc.) -- the dominant OT death euphemism
- **G2837 (koimao)** used for death: the dominant NT death-as-sleep term (Matt 27:52; John 11:11; Acts 7:60; 13:36; 1 Cor 7:39; 11:30; 15:6,18,20,51; 1 Thess 4:13,14,15; 2 Pet 3:4)

## Research Scope and Questions

Investigate these questions using the verses and word studies above:

### 1. The OT Death-State: What Do the Dead Experience?
- What do the OT passages collectively say about the condition of the dead? (Ps 146:4; Ecc 9:5-6,10; Ps 6:5; 115:17; 88:10-12; 30:9; Job 14:12,21; 3:17-18; Isa 38:18-19; Job 34:14-15)
- Are these statements limited in scope (e.g., "under the sun" in Ecclesiastes), or are they presented as universal truths about the dead?
- What do the Psalms and Job add that Ecclesiastes does not?
- How many authors make these statements? From how many books?

### 2. Death as Sleep: Meaning and Implications
- What does the sleep metaphor for death teach? What do sleeping people experience? What are the characteristics of sleep that map onto death?
- Count and list all biblical authors who call death "sleep" (shakab, yashen, koimao, katheudo)
- Does Jesus endorse the sleep metaphor? (John 11:11-14; Matt 9:24; Mark 5:39)
- Does Paul use death-as-sleep consistently? (1 Cor 15:6,18,51; 1 Thess 4:13-15)
- What is the difference between koimao (used for death) and katheudo (used for both literal sleep and death)?

### 3. Sheol/Hades: What Kind of Place?
- What is sheol? Examine all 67 OT occurrences (H7585). Is it a place of consciousness or unconsciousness?
- What is hades? Examine all 11 NT occurrences (G86). Is it the same as sheol?
- Both righteous and wicked go to sheol (Gen 37:35; Ps 9:17) -- what does this reveal?
- What does Ecc 9:10 say about sheol? "There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave (sheol)"
- What do the rephaim (H7496, "shades of the dead") passages say? (Job 26:5; Ps 88:10; Isa 14:9; 26:14,19)
- Is there any OT passage that describes sheol as a place of conscious activity? If so, is it didactic or poetic/figurative?

### 4. Alleged Conscious Intermediate State Passages (CRITICAL SECTION)
For EACH of these passages, investigate:
- What does the passage actually say? (Direct quote)
- What genre is the passage? (Didactic, parabolic, apocalyptic, narrative)
- Who are the subjects?
- Does the passage explicitly teach a conscious intermediate state, or is that inferred?
- Are there alternative readings consistent with the OT death-state passages?

**a. 2 Cor 5:1-9** -- "Absent from the body, present with the Lord"
- What is the full context (5:1-9)? What does Paul desire -- to be unclothed or clothed upon?
- How does 5:4 relate to 1 Cor 15:53-54 (shared vocabulary: mortality swallowed up)?
- Does the passage describe the intermediate state or express preference/expectation?
- How does this compare with 1 Thess 4:16-17 (Paul's own teaching on being with the Lord)?

**b. Phil 1:21-24** -- "To depart and be with Christ"
- What does "depart" (analusis) mean? Is there any time indicator between departure and being with Christ?
- From a sleeper's perspective, is there subjective time between death and resurrection?
- How does this relate to Paul's expectation of resurrection (Phil 3:10-11)?

**c. Luke 23:43** -- "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise"
- Greek has no punctuation. Where does "today" (semeron) attach grammatically?
- Compare: "I say unto thee today, thou shalt be with me in paradise" vs. "I say unto thee, today thou shalt be with me in paradise"
- Did Jesus go to paradise that day? John 20:17: "I am not yet ascended to my Father"
- Where was Jesus between death and resurrection? (Acts 2:27,31; Ps 16:10; Matt 12:40)

**d. Luke 16:19-31** -- Rich man and Lazarus
- What genre is this? Is it a parable or a historical narrative?
- What are the structural elements? (Named character = Lazarus; Abraham's bosom; flame; gulf)
- Does Jesus use contemporary Jewish imagery to make a moral point about using Moses and the prophets?
- Does the passage teach doctrine about the intermediate state, or does it teach about listening to Moses and the prophets?
- Does any other scripture describe "Abraham's bosom" as a conscious intermediate location?

**e. Rev 6:9-11** -- Souls under the altar
- What genre is Revelation? (Apocalyptic vision)
- What are the "souls" (psyche)? Are they conscious entities or is this symbolic?
- Compare: the blood of Abel "crieth" from the ground (Gen 4:10) -- is Abel's blood literally conscious?
- Does Revelation elsewhere use personification of inanimate things?

**f. 1 Sam 28:3-20** -- Witch of Endor / Samuel's apparition
- Did the medium actually bring up Samuel or a demonic impersonation?
- What does the text say appeared? ("An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle")
- What did Samuel's apparition say? ("Tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me")
- Does this passage constitute didactic teaching about the state of the dead?
- What is the genre? (Historical narrative of a prohibited practice -- necromancy)

**g. Matt 17:1-9 / Luke 9:28-36** -- The Transfiguration
- Moses died (Deut 34:5-6). Elijah was translated (2 Ki 2:11). These are different cases.
- Jude 9 references Michael contending over the body of Moses -- a possible resurrection?
- Is this a vision (Matt 17:9: "Tell the vision to no man")?
- Does this teach about the normal state of the dead or is it a unique supernatural event?

**h. 1 Pet 3:18-20** -- Spirits in prison
- Who are the "spirits in prison"? What does the text say?
- When did Christ preach? "By the Spirit" -- does this mean Christ preached through Noah?
- Compare: 1 Pet 1:10-11 (the Spirit of Christ was in the OT prophets)
- Does this passage describe Christ preaching to dead humans between death and resurrection?

### 5. Resurrection as the Hope of the Dead
- Is resurrection presented as awakening from sleep (Dan 12:2; John 5:28-29; 1 Thess 4:16)?
- When does being "with the Lord" happen? (1 Thess 4:17: at the resurrection and rapture)
- What is the significance of John 14:1-3 ("I will come again and receive you unto myself")?
- What did Martha believe about the timing of resurrection? (John 11:24: "at the last day")
- What is Paul's "crown of righteousness" given at? (2 Tim 4:8: "at that day" -- the appearing)
- Are the dead depicted as already rewarded, or waiting for the resurrection?
- What does Heb 11:39-40 say? "These all... received not the promise... they without us should not be made perfect"

### 6. Cross-Study Integration
- How do this study's findings relate to etc-01 (thoughts perish, dead know nothing, death = sleep, being with Lord = resurrection)?
- How do they relate to etc-02 (immortality at resurrection, not before)?
- How do they relate to etc-03 (death = cessation, same vocabulary for all death)?
- What does the state of the dead imply for the final fate debate?
