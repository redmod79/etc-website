## Question

What does the Bible say about the condition or experience of those who have died? Are the dead conscious or unconscious? What do they know, experience, or feel? What happens between death and resurrection?

### Related Existing Studies

| Study | Question | Relevance |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| etc5-01-what-is-man | What is human constitution? Body, soul, spirit? Is the soul immortal? | Establishes that man is a psychosomatic unity; nephesh can die; God alone has immortality; death = sleep (E/N tier). Sets up the anthropological foundation for this study. |
| etc5-02-who-has-immortality | Who possesses immortality? Is it a divine gift or inherent? | Establishes that immortality-positive vocabulary is never applied to any present human; deathless state is post-resurrection (Luk 20:36); mortals receive immortality at resurrection, not at death. |
| etc5-03-biblical-death | What does "death" mean in the Bible? Three registers: physical, spiritual, second death. | Establishes the sleep metaphor from multiple authors; identifies second death as lake of fire; classifies key I-B items (Rich Man and Lazarus, Luke 23:43, Luke 20:38, Phil 1:23, 2 Cor 5:8); I-B IB001 (conscious intermediate state) remains Unresolved. |

#### Key Findings from Prior CONCLUSION.md Files

**From etc5-01 (What Is Man):**
- E tier: Man became a living soul (Gen 2:7); at death dust returns to earth and ruach returns to God (Ecc 12:7); thoughts perish that very day (Ps 146:4); the dead know not anything (Ecc 9:5); man lies down and rises not till the heavens be no more (Job 14:12); death = sleep (Jesus, Paul, Daniel)
- N tier: Death reverses the creation formula; God alone has immortality; death = sleep consistently; at death, when ruach departs, thoughts perish
- I-A (Evidence-Extending): Dead are unconscious (I5/IA005); sleep metaphor implies unconsciousness (I12); "dead know not anything" is not limited to earthly perspective — multiple independent authors state the same without any qualifier (I8 — Moderate against the restriction)
- I-B Unresolved: Conscious intermediate state (I7/IB001) — plain statements on both sides: FOR: Phil 1:23, Luk 23:43; AGAINST: Ecc 9:5, Ps 146:4, Job 14:12

**From etc5-02 (Who Has Immortality):**
- E tier adds: Deathless state ("cannot die any more") is explicitly post-resurrection — Luk 20:35-36 (E082). The three immortality-positive NT words (G110, G861, G862) are never applied to any present human being in any NT occurrence. Life is in the Son; those without the Son do not have life (1 Jhn 5:11-12).
- I-B Unresolved: IB001 confirmed with additional evidence. E082 (Luk 20:36) adds weight to AGAINST side but FOR side still has two Plain items (Phil 1:23; Luk 23:43).

**From etc5-03 (Biblical Death):**
- E tier adds: Sleep metaphor attested by God (Deut 31:16), Daniel (Dan 12:13), Jesus (Jhn 11:11; Luk 8:52), Paul (1 Cor 15; 1 Th 4), Luke (Acts 7:60) — seven or more independent witnesses. The dead "lived" at the first resurrection (Rev 20:4-5), implying they did not "live" before. Ecc 3:21 — Qohelet himself treats the upward destination of the human spirit as an open question: "who knoweth?" (adds weight to the conditionalist reading of Ecc 12:7 — IB005, Moderate toward life-force reading).
- New I-B items: IB006 (Rich Man and Lazarus as literal account — Unresolved); IB007 (Luk 20:38 "all live unto him" = present consciousness — Moderate toward resurrection-certainty)
- IB001 (conscious intermediate state) remains Unresolved after three studies. FOR: Phil 1:23 (Plain), Luk 23:43 (Plain), 2 Cor 5:8 (Contextually Clear), Rich Man/Lazarus (Contextually Clear, genre uncertain). AGAINST: Ecc 9:5 (Plain), Ps 146:4 (Plain), Job 14:12 (Plain), Luk 20:36 (Plain), death = sleep pattern (Contextually Clear).

**Primary unresolved tension entering this study:**
- The core I-B (IB001) has been carried through three prior studies and remains Unresolved. This study (etc5-04) is specifically tasked with the state of the dead and must give IB001 its fullest examination, incorporating all passages on both sides with full context analysis.

### Focus Areas

The following areas were discovered through the tool searches and prior study context. They represent the specific aspects the research agent must investigate.

**1. The sleep vocabulary in both testaments**
All four key sleep words identified by the mandatory tool search must be examined: G2837 koimao, G2518 katheudo, H3462 yashen, H7901 shakab. Distribution of their usage for death across all authors. Note the etc5-03 master evidence already contains E098 (1 Cor 15 koimao) and E099 (1 Th 4 koimao).

**2. The unconsciousness texts (direct statements about what the dead do NOT do)**
Full text and context of every passage making direct assertions about the dead's condition: Ps 6:5; 30:9; 88:10-12; 115:17; 146:4; Ecc 9:5-6,10; 3:19-21; 12:7; Isa 38:18-19; Job 3:13-19; 14:10-12,14,21; 17:13-16. These are the foundation of IA005 (Master). How many independent authors, genres, and settings produce these statements?

**3. Full investigation of the I-B items (passages cited FOR conscious intermediate state)**
Each of these must be examined with full context, genre, and SIS analysis:
- **2 Cor 5:1-8** (especially the tension between v.4 "not unclothed" and v.8 "absent from body") — same author who uses sleep language and says without resurrection the dead perish
- **Phil 1:21-23** ("depart and be with Christ") — immediate context; what does "depart" mean?
- **Luk 23:43** ("today with me in paradise") — Greek punctuation issue; Acts 2:27,31 (Christ was in hades); Jhn 20:17 (not yet ascended on Sunday)
- **Rev 6:9-11** (souls under the altar) — apocalyptic genre; Abel's blood precedent (Gen 4:10); same group "lived" at first resurrection (Rev 20:4-5)
- **Heb 12:23** ("spirits of just men made perfect") — what does "made perfect" mean in Hebrews?
- **Luk 16:19-31** (Rich Man and Lazarus) — genre question; parabolic formula; stated purpose (vv.29-31)
- **1 Sam 28** (Samuel at Endor) — forbidden practice; Samuel says "disquieted"
- **Isa 14:9-11; Ezk 32:21** — mashal genre; poetic personification; rephaim as weak/lax
- **Luk 20:38** ("all live unto him") — already classified IB007, Moderate toward resurrection-certainty; full reexamination here

**4. The sheol/hades vocabulary and its character**
What does every OT sheol passage say about the character of sheol? What does every NT hades passage say? Is hades ever described as a place of consciousness or activity in the plain sense? H7585 (65 occurrences) and G86 (11 occurrences) need complete coverage of descriptive vocabulary.

**5. The rephaim (H7496) passages**
Isa 14:9-10 (rephaim greet the king); Isa 26:14 (they shall not rise); Ps 88:10-12 (shall the rephaim arise and praise?); Prov 21:16 (congregation of the dead). What does the root meaning of rapha (lax/weak) tell us about the rephaim as a category?

**6. The resurrection and "being with Christ" correlation**
1 Th 4:13-18 states believers meet the Lord at the resurrection event — "and so shall we ever be with the Lord." Rev 20:4-5 states the dead "lived" at the first resurrection. How does this govern the reading of "depart and be with Christ" (Phil 1:23)?

**7. New angles for this study (not in prior studies)**
- Acts 7:59-60: Stephen commends his spirit AND falls asleep — both in the same passage. Luke saw no tension between committing one's spirit and sleep being the description of death.
- Jhn 20:17 (Jesus not yet ascended to the Father on Sunday morning, three days after death): if "today in paradise" meant immediate conscious presence, Jesus himself should have been there.
- 1 Cor 15:18: "then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished" — without resurrection, believers who died have perished. If they were consciously with Christ, why would they have "perished"?
- Rev 14:13: "blessed are the dead which die in the Lord... that they may rest from their labours" — death is rest, not continued activity.

## Series Context

This is study 04 in the ETC5 series (The Final Fate of the Wicked). The series uses the ETC5 Evidence Classification methodology (E/N/I taxonomy with I-A/I-B/I-C/I-D tiers). The analysis agent must follow that methodology and use `D:/bible/bible-studies/etc5-series-methodology.md` as the governing document.

**Master evidence file:** `D:/bible/bible-studies/etc5-master-evidence.md`
New evidence items in this study continue from Master E127 (last item in etc5-03).

**Key open question from prior studies:** Master IB001 (conscious intermediate state between death and resurrection) has been Unresolved after three studies. This study must give it full treatment and attempt resolution. Both FOR and AGAINST sides have Plain items. SIS analysis with the full dataset gathered in this study is the path toward resolution.
