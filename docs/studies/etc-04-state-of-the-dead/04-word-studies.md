## SECTION 1: SLEEP-OF-DEATH WORDS

### G2837 — κοιμάω (koimao) — "to sleep; used for death of believers"

**Lexicon:**
- Transliteration: koimao
- Part of Speech: verb
- Definition: "to put to sleep, i.e. (passively or reflexively) to sleep; used for death of believers throughout NT"
- BLB Count: 18 occurrences

**Translation Distribution (KJV, 17 occurrences):**
- sleep / slept / sleeping / asleep variations: ~15 occurrences (88%)
- "be dead" (1x), "We shall" (1x — contextual rendering of 1 Cor 15:51)

**Key Death Occurrences:**
- John 11:11-12: "Lazarus sleepeth" — John 11:13 explicitly glosses it: "he spake of his death"
- Acts 7:60: "he fell asleep" (ekoimeth — Aor Pass Ind 3sg) — Stephen's death
- Acts 13:36: "David...fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption"
- 1 Cor 15:6: "some are fallen asleep" (in context of resurrection argument)
- 1 Cor 15:18: "they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished" (if no resurrection)
- 1 Cor 15:20: "firstfruits of them that slept"
- 1 Cor 15:51: "We shall not all sleep" (but all be changed)
- 1 Thess 4:13: "concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not"
- 1 Thess 4:14: "them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him"
- 1 Thess 4:15: "shall not prevent them which are asleep"
- 2 Pet 3:4: "since the fathers fell asleep"

**Analytical Notes:**
G2837 is Paul's preferred word for the death of believers (never used for literal night-sleep by Paul). Its consistent use in resurrection contexts (1 Cor 15; 1 Thess 4) establishes an inseparable link: sleep of death → waking of resurrection. The word does not support a conscious intermediate state, because sleep is by definition an unconscious rest. The disciples' misunderstanding in John 11:12 ("if he sleep, he shall do well") — treating Jesus's koimao literally — shows the word was normally understood as peaceful rest, not as a metaphor for conscious paradise.

**Contrast with G2518 (katheudo):** G2837 (koimao) is the specifically euphemistic/technical term Paul uses for death of believers; G2518 (katheudo) is the general word for ordinary sleep. Paul uses koimao for dead believers in all thirteen NT occurrences in that sense; he never uses koimao for literal night-rest.

### G2518 — καθεύδω (katheudo) — "to sleep; used both for literal sleep and figuratively for death"

**Lexicon:**
- Transliteration: katheudo
- Part of Speech: verb
- Definition: "from kata + heudo (to sleep); to lie down to rest, i.e. (by implication) to be dead (as lifeless); sleep"
- BLB Count: 22 occurrences

**Translation Distribution (KJV, 23 occurrences):**
- asleep (4x), sleep (4x), sleepeth (3x), slept (2x), Sleep on (2x), sleeping (2x), others (6x)

**Key Death Usages:**
- Matt 9:24; Mark 5:39; Luke 8:52: "the maid/damsel is not dead, but sleepeth" — Jesus using katheudo as a synonym for death (raising of Jairus's daughter)
- 1 Thess 5:10: "whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him" — contrasting the alert vs. the dead (context of 1 Thess 5:6-10)
- Eph 5:14: "Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead" — figurative for spiritual death using sleep imagery

**Distinction from G2837:**
- G2837 (koimao) = specifically for death of believers in NT; aorist passive form preferred
- G2518 (katheudo) = more general word for sleep; used for Jairus's daughter (katheudei present act ind)
- Both words reinforce that death = sleep imagery across the NT

### H3462 — יָשֵׁן (yashen) — "to sleep; figuratively to die"

**Lexicon:**
- Transliteration: yashen
- Part of Speech: verb (primitive root)
- Definition: "properly, to be slack or languid, i.e. (by implication) sleep (figuratively, to die); also to grow old, stale or inveterate"
- BLB Count: 19 occurrences

**Translation Distribution (KJV, 20 occurrences):**
- sleep / slept / asleep variants: 16 occurrences; "old (store)" / "remained long" (stale/old usage): 4 occurrences

**Key Death Occurrences:**
- Job 3:13: "I should have slept" — in the context of death-as-rest
- Jer 51:39: "that they may sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake" (yashen + olam shena)
- Jer 51:57: "they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake" — same formula; death = permanent non-waking sleep
- Dan 12:2: "many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake" (yeshene admat-aphar) — the dead are described as "sleepers of the dust"

**Root Meaning:**
"To be slack/languid" — the root conveys limpness or inactivity. In death contexts, yashen describes the inert state of the dead awaiting resurrection. Daniel 12:2 is the critical text: the dead are defined as "sleepers in the dust" whose sleep ends only at resurrection (yaqitsu — they awake, Hiphil of qits).

**Grammatical Note on Dan 12:2 (H3462):**
The construct form mi-yshenei ("from the sleepers of") directly modifies "admat-aphar" (ground of dust). The dead are "sleepers of the dust-ground." The resurrection = the awakening (yaqitsu) from this sleep. No intermediate waking is described between the sleep of death and the waking of resurrection.

### H7901 — שָׁכַב (shakab) — "to lie down; dominant OT death euphemism"

**Lexicon:**
- Transliteration: shakab
- Part of Speech: verb (primitive root)
- Definition: "to lie down (for rest, sexual connection, decease or any other purpose)"
- BLB Count: 212 occurrences

**Key Death Occurrences:**
- Deut 31:16: "thou shalt sleep with thy fathers" (shakab) — God to Moses
- 2 Sam 7:12: "when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers" — God to David
- 1 Kgs 2:10: "So David slept with his fathers" (standard royal death formula)
- Job 7:21: "for now shall I sleep in the dust" (shakab)
- Job 14:12: "So man lieth down (shakab), and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake"
- Isa 14:8: "Since thou art laid down (shakab), no feller is come up against us"
- Isa 14:18: "All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie (shakab) in glory"
- Ezk 32:19-32: "be thou laid (shakab) with the uncircumcised" — repeated throughout the passage

**Key Formula:**
"Slept with his fathers" (wayishkab im-avotav) is the death notice formula used for every king of Israel and Judah in the historical books (1 Kgs, 2 Kgs, 1-2 Chr). The word is used hundreds of times for death throughout the OT.

**Critical Verse (Job 14:12):**
"So man lieth down (shakab), and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep." — The condition of the dead is lying-down/sleep; resurrection requires divine action; the sleep continues "till the heavens be no more" — eschatological.

## SECTION 2: REALM OF THE DEAD WORDS

### H7585 — שְׁאוֹל (sheol) — "the realm of the dead"

**Lexicon:**
- Transliteration: sheol
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- Definition: "hades or the world of the dead (as if a subterranean retreat), including its accessories and inmates: grave, hell, pit"
- BLB Count: 65 occurrences
- KJV translations: "grave" (32x), "hell" (31x), "pit" (3x)

**Descriptive Vocabulary for Sheol:**
- "Land of forgetfulness" (Ps 88:12) — eretz neshiyah: the forgotten place
- "Darkness" (Job 17:13; Ps 88:6,12; Isa 38:18) — sheol = the dark
- "Silence" (Ps 115:17 — "go down into silence") — dumah
- "Pit" (Job 17:16; 33:18; Ps 30:9; Isa 38:18)
- "No return" (Job 7:9-10; 16:22)
- Dead are "cut off from thy hand" (Ps 88:5)
- Sheol cannot praise (Isa 38:18)
- "Worms under thee, worms cover thee" (Isa 14:11)
- "No work, device, knowledge, wisdom" (Ecc 9:10)
- "Prisoners rest together" (Job 3:18)

**Who is in Sheol:**
- All the dead — both righteous and wicked — go to sheol: Ps 49:14-15 (all laid in the grave, though God redeems the righteous from it); Isa 14:9-11 (all kings of nations); Ecc 9:10 (no work in sheol "whither thou goest")
- The psalmist: "my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto the grave" (Ps 88:3)
- Jacob: "then will ye bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave/sheol" (Gen 42:38)
- Job expects sheol as his temporary hiding place until resurrection (Job 14:13)

**Key Observation:**
Sheol in the OT is consistently described as a place of: (1) silence, (2) darkness, (3) forgetfulness, (4) no praise, (5) no work or knowledge, (6) separation from the living, and (7) confinement with "bars of the pit" (Job 17:16). This comprehensive picture is one of inactivity and unconsciousness, not of blessed conscious existence. The righteous hope is not blessed experience IN sheol, but redemption FROM sheol through resurrection (Ps 49:15; 16:10).

### G86 — ᾅδης (hades) — "the unseen; place of departed souls"

**Lexicon:**
- Transliteration: hades
- Part of Speech: proper locative noun
- Definition: "from a (negative) + idein (to see); properly, unseen, i.e. 'Hades' or the place (state) of departed souls"
- BLB Count: 11 NT occurrences

**Translation Distribution (KJV, 11 occurrences):**
- "hell" (7x), "of hell" (2x), "O grave" (1x), "Hell" (1x)

**LXX Background:**
The LXX uses hades to translate sheol in the majority of OT occurrences. Hades and sheol are functionally equivalent: both describe the realm of the dead (all the dead), not a specifically pleasant or unpleasant intermediate state for particular categories.

**Key NT Occurrences:**
- Matt 11:23: "Capernaum...shalt be brought down to hell [hades]"
- Matt 16:18: "gates of hell [hades] shall not prevail" — hades as a power/domain
- Luke 16:23: "in hell [hades] he lift up his eyes, being in torments" — Rich Man and Lazarus
- Acts 2:27: "thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [hades]" — Ps 16:10 applied to Christ's resurrection
- Acts 2:31: "his soul was not left in hell [hades], neither his flesh did see corruption" — resurrection took Christ out of hades
- Rev 1:18: "I have the keys of hell [hades] and of death" — Christ has authority over death/hades
- Rev 6:8: "Death, and Hell [hades] followed with him" — hades follows death as a realm
- Rev 20:13: "death and hell [hades] delivered up the dead which were in them" — hades = holding state
- Rev 20:14: "death and hell [hades] were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." — hades is TEMPORARY; it is abolished at the final judgment

**Key Observation:**
Rev 20:13-14 is decisive for the nature of hades: it is a temporary holding state that delivers up the dead at the final resurrection and is then itself destroyed. This confirms that hades ≠ eternal final destination, and that those in hades are "in it" until resurrection brings them out. Acts 2:31 confirms that Christ's resurrection = his soul leaving hades — which is the model for all resurrection.

## SECTION 3: ADDITIONAL DEATH VOCABULARY

### G3498 — νεκρός (nekros) — "dead; corpse"

**Lexicon:**
- Transliteration: nekros
- Part of Speech: adjective (used as noun)
- Definition: "from nekys (a corpse); dead (literally or figuratively); dead, dead body"
- BLB Count: 132 NT occurrences

**Key Death-State Usages:**
- 1 Thess 4:16: "the dead (nekroi) in Christ shall rise first" — physical resurrection of the dead
- 1 Cor 15:29: "baptized for the dead (nekrōn)" — the dead as a category awaiting resurrection
- Rev 20:5: "the rest of the dead (nekrōn) lived not again until the thousand years were finished" — dead = not-yet-living; the default state is not-alive until resurrection
- Rev 14:13: "Blessed are the dead (nekroi) which die in the Lord" — dead = resting, not actively praising
- John 5:28: "all that are in the graves (mnēmeiois) shall hear his voice" — the nekroi are in graves, not in a conscious intermediate location
- Matt 10:28: "fear him which is able to destroy both soul (psychen) and body (soma)" — even the soul is mortal/destructible

**Figurative Usage:**
- Eph 2:1,5: "dead in trespasses and sins" — spiritual death as the pre-conversion state
- Col 2:13: "dead in your sins" — same figurative use
- Eph 5:14: "Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead" — combining katheudo and nekros in a figurative resurrection call

**Note:**
The 132 NT occurrences of nekros are predominantly in resurrection contexts (1 Cor 15 alone has 24 occurrences). The word simply means "dead" without specifying the quality of the dead person's current experience. The question this study addresses is whether the nekroi are conscious or not — and nekros itself does not answer that; the answer must come from the descriptive passages.

### G5590 — ψυχή (psyche) — "soul; life; the living soul"

**Lexicon:**
- Transliteration: psyche
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- Definition: "from psucho (to breathe); breath, i.e. (by implication) spirit, abstractly or concretely (the animal sentient principle only; thus distinguished from pneuma, which is the rational and immortal soul); the soul, life, the living soul"
- BLB Count: 105 NT occurrences

**Translation Distribution (KJV, 87 NT occurrences):**
- "soul" (32x = 36.8%), "life" (25x = 28.7%), "souls" (18x = 20.7%), "lives" (4x = 4.6%), others (8x)

**Key Death-State Occurrences:**
- Rev 6:9: "the souls (psychas) of them that were slain" — under the altar (see below)
- Rev 20:4: "I saw the souls (psychas) of them that were beheaded" — lived and reigned at resurrection
- Rev 16:3: "every living soul (psyche) died" — souls CAN die (the sea "died")
- Matt 10:28: "fear him which is able to destroy both soul (psychen) and body" — soul is mortal/destructible
- John 12:25: "he that loveth his life (psychen) shall lose it" — psyche = life-force
- Gen 35:18 (LXX basis): "as her soul (psyche) was in departing, (for she died)" — soul departure = death event

**Range of Meaning for Psyche:**
1. Physical life/breath: Matt 6:25 ("take no thought for your life/psyche what ye shall eat")
2. The whole person: Acts 2:41 ("about three thousand souls were added")
3. The inner self/seat of feeling: Matt 26:38 ("my soul is exceeding sorrowful")
4. The life given in sacrifice: John 10:11 ("the good shepherd giveth his life/psychen for the sheep")

**Critical Note on Rev 6:9 and the "souls under the altar":**
The OT background is Lev 17:11 ("the life [nephesh/psyche] of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar") and Gen 4:10 (Abel's blood "crieth" from the ground). In the OT, when blood was poured out at the altar, the life (nephesh) was understood as in that blood, poured out at the base of the altar. The martyrs' "souls under the altar" in Rev 6:9 most naturally read against this OT background: the martyrs' blood (= their lives poured out) cries for vindication from "under the altar." This is a figurative representation of the martyrs' sacrifice, not necessarily literal conscious disembodied entities. The response in v.11 is "rest yet for a little season" — rest, not ongoing conscious activity.

**Psyche vs. Pneuma distinction:**
The BLB definition draws a distinction: psyche = "the animal sentient principle only" (the life/breath); pneuma = "the rational and immortal soul." This distinction is important for interpretation: if psyche means simply "life" in Rev 6:9, then the "souls under the altar" = the lives poured out in sacrifice, not necessarily conscious personal entities.

### H7496 — רָפָא (rephaim) — "the dead; the shades; the limp ones"

**Lexicon:**
- Transliteration: rapha (singular); rephaim (plural — the word occurs only in plural)
- Part of Speech: masculine plural noun
- Definition: "from rapha in the sense of slack; properly, lax, i.e. (figuratively) a ghost (as dead; in plural only): dead, deceased"
- BLB Count: 8 occurrences
- KJV translations: "the dead" (5x), "Dead" (1x), "of the dead" (1x), "deceased" (1x)

**All 8 Occurrences:**
- Job 26:5: "Dead things [rephaim] are formed from under the waters" — rephaim in sheol below the deep
- Ps 88:10-11: "Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead [rephaim]? shall the dead [rephaim] arise and praise thee? Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave?" — expected answer: No
- Prov 2:18: "her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead [rephaim]"
- Prov 9:18: "he knoweth not that the dead [rephaim] are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell" — rephaim in sheol
- Prov 21:16: "The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead [rephaim]"
- Isa 14:9: "Hell from beneath is moved for thee...it stirreth up the dead [rephaim] for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth" — the taunt-song passage
- Isa 26:14: "They are dead [rephaim], they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise"
- Isa 26:19: "the earth shall cast out the dead [rephaim]" — the RIGHTEOUS rephaim will be raised

**Root Meaning:**
H7496 derives from rapha = "to be slack, lax, weak, limp." The rephaim are the "limp/flaccid ones" — describing the inert, powerless character of the dead in sheol. This root meaning directly contradicts the idea of vigorous conscious intermediate existence: the dead are "limp" in sheol.

**Critical Isaiah 26:14/19 Contrast:**
- v.14: rephaim (wicked dead) — "shall not live...shall not rise" — their sleep is permanent unless resurrected
- v.19: same root — the RIGHTEOUS rephaim will be raised: "the earth shall cast out the dead"
- The contrast is not between two different experiences in the intermediate state, but between two different resurrection outcomes. Both groups are currently in the same sleeping state; the difference is whether they rise.

**Ps 88:10 Significance:**
The expected answer to "shall the dead [rephaim] arise and praise thee?" is No — the rephaim do not arise and praise. This is consistent with Ps 115:17, Isa 38:18, and Ecc 9:10. The rephaim are specifically the category of dead that do NOT praise, do NOT arise (in the current pre-resurrection state).

## WORD STUDY CROSS-REFERENCES

**Sleep-of-death unified set (all pointing the same direction):**
G2837 + G2518 + H3462 + H7901 all describe death as sleep/lying-down. In 100% of their death-related uses, these words describe an inactive, resting, non-conscious state. Not one use of these words in a death context implies ongoing conscious activity.

**Sheol/Hades unified description:**
H7585 + G86 describe the same realm: dark, silent, no praise, no work, no return, bars of confinement. Hades is explicitly temporary (Rev 20:14), delivering up the dead at resurrection and then being abolished. The consistent character is a holding state of non-activity awaiting resurrection, not a conscious blessed intermediate experience.

**Mortality of the soul:**
G5590 (psyche) CAN die (Rev 16:3; Matt 10:28). The soul is not inherently immortal in NT vocabulary. Psyche in Rev 6:9 most naturally refers to the poured-out lives of the martyrs (OT blood/altar background), not conscious disembodied entities.

**Rephaim root:**
H7496 (rephaim = "limp ones") provides the OT's own etymological commentary on the dead: they are the weak, inert, limp ones. This is the opposite of the conscious intermediate state hypothesis.
