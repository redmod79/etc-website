## A. The Immortality Word-Study Passages

### 1. 1 Corinthians 15:42-54 -- The Resurrection Chapter

**Context (1 Corinthians 15:21-26) -- Death through Adam, life through Christ:**
> 15:21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
> 15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
> 15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
> 15:24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
> 15:25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
> 15:26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

**Key passage (1 Corinthians 15:42-54):**
> 15:42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption [G5356 phthora]; it is raised in incorruption [G861 aphtharsia]:
> 15:43 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
> 15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
> 15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
> 15:46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
> 15:47 The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.
> 15:48 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
> 15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
> 15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption [G5356 phthora] inherit incorruption [G861 aphtharsia].
> 15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
> 15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible [G862 aphthartos], and we shall be changed.
> 15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption [G861 aphtharsia], and this mortal [G2349 thnetos] must put on immortality [G110 athanasia].
> 15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption [G861 aphtharsia], and this mortal [G2349 thnetos] shall have put on immortality [G110 athanasia], then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
> 15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
> 15:56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
> 15:57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

**Word-study density:** This single passage contains G110 (athanasia) x2, G861 (aphtharsia) x4, G2349 (thnetos) x2, G862 (aphthartos) x1, G5356 (phthora) x2.

### 2. 1 Timothy 6:14-16 -- God "Who Only Hath Immortality"

**Context (1 Timothy 6:11-19):**
> 6:11 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
> 6:12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.
> 6:13 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;
> 6:14 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
> 6:15 Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
> 6:16 Who only hath immortality [G110 athanasia], dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.
> 6:17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
> 6:18 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
> 6:19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

Note: v.12 and v.19 both use "lay hold on eternal life" -- framing eternal life as something to be grasped, not already possessed. v.16 states God "only" (monos) hath immortality.

---

### 3. Romans 2:7 -- Seeking Immortality

**Context (Romans 2:4-11):**
> 2:4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
> 2:5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
> 2:6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
> 2:7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality [G861 aphtharsia], eternal life:
> 2:8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
> 2:9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;

Note: The contrast structure: seek immortality -> receive eternal life (v.7) vs. obey unrighteousness -> receive wrath (v.8-9).

### 4. 2 Timothy 1:8-12 -- Christ Brought Life and Immortality to Light

**Context:**
> 1:8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;
> 1:9 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
> 1:10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality [G861 aphtharsia] to light through the gospel:
> 1:11 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
> 1:12 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

### 5. Romans 6:12 -- Mortal Body

> 6:10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
> 6:11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
> 6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal [G2349 thnetos] body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
> 6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

---

### 6. Romans 8:9-13 -- Quickening Mortal Bodies

> 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
> 8:10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
> 8:11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal [G2349 thnetos] bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
> 8:12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
> 8:13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

---

### 7. 2 Corinthians 4:7-14 -- Life Manifest in Mortal Flesh

> 4:7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
> 4:10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
> 4:11 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal [G2349 thnetos] flesh.
> 4:14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

> 4:17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
> 4:18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.

---

### 8. 2 Corinthians 5:1-8 -- Mortality Swallowed Up of Life

> 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
> 5:2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
> 5:3 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
> 5:4 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality [G2349 thnetos] might be swallowed up of life.
> 5:5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
> 5:6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
> 5:7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
> 5:8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

---

### 9. 1 Timothy 1:17 -- God Called Immortal

> 1:15 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
> 1:16 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
> 1:17 Now unto the King eternal, immortal [G862 aphthartos], invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

---

### 10. Romans 1:23 -- Uncorruptible God vs. Corruptible Man

> 1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
> 1:21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
> 1:22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
> 1:23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible [G862 aphthartos] God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
> 1:25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

Note: God is "uncorruptible" (aphthartos); man is "corruptible" (phthartos). The text places these in direct contrast.

---

### 11. 1 Peter 1:3-5, 23 -- Incorruptible Inheritance and Seed

> 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

---

> 3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

## Cross-Testament Parallels

### Notable Parallel Connections

1. **1 Tim 6:16 <-> 1 Tim 1:17** (Hybrid 0.448): Both are doxologies to God using immortality/incorruptibility language. 1:17 calls God "immortal" (aphthartos); 6:16 says God "only hath immortality" (athanasia).

2. **1 Tim 6:16 <-> 1 Cor 15:50** (Hybrid 0.425): Both share "immortality" keyword. 1 Cor 15:50 adds that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.

3. **2 Tim 1:10 <-> Rom 5:21** (Hybrid 0.490): Both connect Christ, death, and life/immortality. Rom 5:21: grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ.

4. **2 Tim 1:10 <-> 2 Cor 4:11** (Hybrid 0.461): Both discuss the manifestation of life through death -- Christ's death and life made manifest in mortal flesh.

5. **John 3:16 <-> John 6:40** (Hybrid 0.518): Both present the believe -> everlasting life pattern. Both include "everyone" who believes.

6. **John 3:16 <-> Gen 3:22** (OT, Hybrid 0.408): The OT parallel tool links "everlasting life" in John 3:16 to "live for ever" in Gen 3:22 -- connecting the offer of eternal life to the barring from the tree of life.

7. **Luke 20:36 <-> Matt 22:30 / Mark 12:25** (Hybrid 0.500/0.435): Synoptic parallels. Matthew and Mark report the same teaching but without Luke's addition of "neither can they die any more."

8. **1 Cor 15:53 <-> 1 Cor 15:54** (Hybrid 0.605): These are paired statements; v.53 states the necessity ("must put on"), v.54 states the fulfillment ("shall have put on").
