### SECTION A: Core Immortality Passages (NT)

---

#### 1 Timothy 6:16 — God alone has immortality

**Context (1 Timothy 6:11-19):**

> 1 Tim 6:11 — But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
> 1 Tim 6:12 — Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.
> 1 Tim 6:13 — I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and [before] Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;
> 1 Tim 6:14 — That thou keep [this] commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
> 1 Tim 6:15 — Which in his times he shall shew, [who is] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
> **1 Tim 6:16 — Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom [be] honour and power everlasting. Amen.**
> 1 Tim 6:17 — Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
> 1 Tim 6:18 — That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
> 1 Tim 6:19 — Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

**Greek Key Terms:**
- μόνος (monos, G3441) = "only/alone" — exclusive, not comparative
- ἔχων (echo, present participle) = "having" — continuous present possession
- ἀθανασίαν (athanasian, G110) = immortality

**Note:** v.15 calls God "the blessed and only (monos) Potentate"; v.16 calls God the one "who only (monos) hath immortality." The same word monos used twice in consecutive verses establishes an exclusive claim. Verse 6:12 instructs Timothy to "lay hold on eternal life" — implying he does not yet have it but is to take hold of it.

#### 1 Timothy 1:17 — The immortal, invisible God

**Context (1 Timothy 1:12-20):**

> 1 Tim 1:12 — And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
> 1 Tim 1:13 — Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did [it] ignorantly in unbelief.
> 1 Tim 1:14 — And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
> 1 Tim 1:15 — This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
> 1 Tim 1:16 — Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
> **1 Tim 1:17 — Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.**

**Note:** The word translated "immortal" here is ἄφθαρτος (aphthartos, G862) — the adjective form of "incorruptible/undecaying." In v.16 "life everlasting" (zoe aionion) is associated with believing in Christ. The doxology describes God alone as "immortal" (aphthartos) — the same root word used for what humans must "put on" at resurrection (1 Cor 15:52-54).

#### 1 Corinthians 15:1-58 — The Resurrection Chapter

**Full text (selected verses with full context for the key section):**

> 1 Cor 15:1 — Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
> 1 Cor 15:2 — By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
> 1 Cor 15:3 — For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
> 1 Cor 15:4 — And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
> ...
> **1 Cor 15:12 — Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?**
> 1 Cor 15:13 — But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
> 1 Cor 15:14 — And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain.
> ...
> 1 Cor 15:18 — Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
> 1 Cor 15:19 — If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
> **1 Cor 15:20 — But now is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept.**
> **1 Cor 15:21 — For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.**
> **1 Cor 15:22 — For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.**
> 1 Cor 15:23 — But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
> 1 Cor 15:24 — Then [cometh] the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
> 1 Cor 15:25 — For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
> **1 Cor 15:26 — The last enemy [that] shall be destroyed [is] death.**
> ...
> 1 Cor 15:35 — But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
> 1 Cor 15:36 — [Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
> 1 Cor 15:37 — And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other [grain]:
> 1 Cor 15:38 — But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
> ...
> **1 Cor 15:42 — So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:**
> **1 Cor 15:43 — It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:**
> **1 Cor 15:44 — It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.**
> **1 Cor 15:45 — And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a quickening spirit.**
> 1 Cor 15:46 — Howbeit that [was] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
> 1 Cor 15:47 — The first man [is] of the earth, earthy: the second man [is] the Lord from heaven.
> 1 Cor 15:48 — As [is] the earthy, such [are] they also that are earthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they also that are heavenly.
> 1 Cor 15:49 — And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
> **1 Cor 15:50 — Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.**
> 1 Cor 15:51 — Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
> **1 Cor 15:52 — In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.**
> **1 Cor 15:53 — For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.**
> **1 Cor 15:54 — So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.**
> **1 Cor 15:55 — O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory?**
> 1 Cor 15:56 — The sting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law.
> 1 Cor 15:57 — But thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

**Key structural observation:** Paul uses two parallel pairs in vv.53-54:
- Pair 1: corruptible (phthartos, G5349) must put on incorruption (aphtharsia, G861)
- Pair 2: mortal (thnetos, G2349) must put on immortality (athanasia, G110)
The future tense of this transformation (at the last trump, v.52) is explicit. This is not a past or present state.

#### Romans 2:7 — Seeking immortality

**Context (Romans 2:5-11):**

> Rom 2:5 — But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
> **Rom 2:6 — Who will render to every man according to his deeds:**
> **Rom 2:7 — To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:**
> **Rom 2:8 — But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,**
> **Rom 2:9 — Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;**
> **Rom 2:10 — But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:**
> Rom 2:11 — For there is no respect of persons with God.

**Greek Note:** The word translated "immortality" in Rom 2:7 is ἀφθαρσίαν (aphtharsia, G861), not athanasia (G110). The four things being sought: glory (doxa), honor (time), incorruption/immortality (aphtharsia), eternal life (zoe aionion). The present participle "seeking" (zetousin) establishes that these are things people do not yet have.

#### 2 Timothy 1:9-11 — Christ brought immortality to light

**Context (2 Timothy 1:8-14):**

> 2 Tim 1:8 — Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;
> **2 Tim 1:9 — Who hath saved us, and called [us] with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,**
> **2 Tim 1:10 — But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:**
> 2 Tim 1:11 — Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
> 2 Tim 1:12 — For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

**Greek Note:** The word "immortality" in 2 Tim 1:10 is again ἀφθαρσίαν (aphtharsia, G861). Christ "abolished" (katargeo, aorist participle = completed action) death and "brought to light" (photizo, aorist participle) life and immortality. The gospel reveals what was always the divine plan. The word "brought to light" implies pre-existence of the concept, now made clear through Christ's resurrection.

### SECTION B: Mortal/Corruptible Human Condition

---

#### Romans 6:12; 8:11 — Mortal body

> **Rom 6:12 — Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.**
> [Context: Rom 6:9-14]
> Rom 6:9 — Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
> Rom 6:10 — For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
> Rom 6:11 — Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
> **Rom 6:12 — Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.**

> **Rom 8:11 — But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.**
> [Context: Rom 8:9-13]
> Rom 8:9 — But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
> Rom 8:10 — And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness.
> **Rom 8:11 — But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.**

**Note:** G2349 (thnetos, mortal) is used in both verses. The present-tense "mortal body" describes the current human condition. The resurrection/quickening is future. In Rom 8:21 the "bondage of corruption" applies to the whole creation.

#### 2 Corinthians 4:11; 5:1-5 — Mortal flesh / Mortality

> **2 Cor 4:11 — For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.**
> 2 Cor 4:12 — So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
> 2 Cor 4:14 — Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present [us] with you.

> **2 Cor 5:1 — For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.**
> 2 Cor 5:2 — For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
> 2 Cor 5:3 — If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
> **2 Cor 5:4 — For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.**
> 2 Cor 5:5 — Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
> 2 Cor 5:6 — Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
> 2 Cor 5:7 — (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
> 2 Cor 5:8 — We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

**Note:** 2 Cor 5:4 uses the noun "mortality" (thneton, G2349 as a noun) — "that mortality might be swallowed up of life." This is the groaning of the present mortal state toward the future immortal state. The "clothing upon" language parallels 1 Cor 15:53 "put on immortality."

#### Romans 1:23 — Uncorruptible God vs. corruptible man

> **Rom 1:23 — And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.**
> [Context: Rom 1:20-25]
> Rom 1:20 — For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
> Rom 1:21 — Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
> Rom 1:22 — Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
> **Rom 1:23 — And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man...**

**Note:** The contrast is explicit:
- "uncorruptible God" = ἀφθάρτου (aphthartos, G862) — the same word used for God in 1 Tim 1:17 ("immortal")
- "corruptible man" = φθαρτῷ (phthartos, G5349) — the same word used in 1 Cor 15:53 ("this corruptible must put on incorruption")
Paul's argument: humans replaced the image of the incorruptible (aphthartos) God with images of corruptible (phthartos) creatures including themselves. Humans are phthartos — the same category as birds and beasts.

#### 1 Peter 1:3-5, 18, 23; 3:4 — Incorruptible inheritance and seed

> **1 Pet 1:3 — Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,**
> **1 Pet 1:4 — To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,**
> **1 Pet 1:5 — Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.**
> ...
> **1 Pet 1:18 — Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, [as] silver and gold, from your vain conversation [received] by tradition from your fathers;**
> 1 Pet 1:19 — But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:
> ...
> **1 Pet 1:23 — Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.**
> ...
> **1 Pet 3:4 — But [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, [even the ornament] of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.**

**Note:** The G862 (aphthartos) family:
- v.4: inheritance = ἄφθαρτον (aphthartos) — not yet received, reserved in heaven, to be revealed in the last time (v.5)
- v.18: corruptible things = φθαρτοῖς (phthartos) — silver and gold are corruptible
- v.23: incorruptible seed = ἀφθάρτου (aphthartos) — the word of God
- 3:4: the ornament of a meek spirit = ἀφθάρτου (aphthartos) as a character quality

The inheritance of 1 Pet 1:4 is not yet possessed — it is "reserved in heaven" and "ready to be revealed in the last time."

---

### SECTION C: Tree of Life — Eden and Eschatology

---

#### Genesis 2:4-25 — Eden: Tree of Life planted

> Gen 2:4 — These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created...
> Gen 2:7 — And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
> Gen 2:8 — And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
> **Gen 2:9 — And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.**
> Gen 2:15 — And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
> Gen 2:16 — And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
> **Gen 2:17 — But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.**

**Note:** Two trees: the tree of life (ets hachayyim) and the tree of knowledge. Man had free access to the tree of life (no prohibition stated against it) before the fall. The prohibition was against the tree of knowledge. Man was therefore in a state dependent on continued access to the tree of life for ongoing vitality — not inherently immortal.

---

#### Genesis 3:1-24 — The Fall and Barring of the Tree of Life

> Gen 3:1-5 — The serpent deceives; "Ye shall not surely die"
> Gen 3:6 — Woman eats, gives to husband; he eats
> Gen 3:7-13 — Consequences begin
> Gen 3:14-19 — Curses pronounced
> **Gen 3:19 — In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou [art], and unto dust shalt thou return.**
> Gen 3:20-21 — Eve named; coats of skins
> **Gen 3:22 — And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:**
> **Gen 3:23 — Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.**
> **Gen 3:24 — So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.**

**Hebrew Grammar (Gen 3:22 — see hebrew-parsing.md):**
- Key phrase: "וָחַי לְעֹלָם" (wachay le-olam) = "and live for ever"
- chayyim (tree of life) = plural of intensity for H2416
- olam (H5769) = eternity/forever
- The verse states God's concern: man acquiring "life for ever" by eating the tree
- The protective action (cherubim + flaming sword, v.24) = physical barrier preventing immortality acquisition

**Critical Observation:** This passage is the foundational OT evidence that:
1. Man did NOT possess inherent immortality after the fall
2. The tree of life was the potential source of ongoing life
3. God actively prevented fallen man from accessing immortal life
4. Everlasting life ("live for ever") requires the tree of life — an external source

---

#### Revelation 2:7 — Tree of life promised to overcomers

**Context (Revelation 2:1-7):**

> Rev 2:1 — Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write...
> Rev 2:4 — Nevertheless I have [somewhat] against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
> Rev 2:5 — Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent...
> **Rev 2:7 — He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.**

**Note:** The tree of life is presented as a future reward for overcomers, not a present possession. The "paradise of God" is the eschatological restoration of Eden.

---

#### Revelation 22:1-5, 14 — Tree of life in the New Jerusalem

> **Rev 22:1 — And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.**
> **Rev 22:2 — In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, [was there] the tree of life, which bare twelve [manner of] fruits, [and] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations.**
> Rev 22:3 — And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
> Rev 22:4 — And they shall see his face; and his name [shall be] in their foreheads.
> **Rev 22:5 — And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.**
> ...
> **Rev 22:14 — Blessed [are] they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.**

**Note:** The eschatological resolution:
- Tree of life is restored in the New Jerusalem (v.2)
- It is fruitful and its leaves heal the nations
- Access to it is the blessed reward (v.14 — "have right to the tree of life")
- In this state, they "reign for ever and ever" (v.5 — H5769 equivalent: eis tous aionas ton aionon)

---

### SECTION D: Soul Mortality

---

#### Ezekiel 18:1-32 — The soul that sins shall die

> **Ezk 18:4 — Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.**
> Ezk 18:5-9 — The just man who does right shall live
> Ezk 18:10-13 — The wicked son who does evil shall die
> Ezk 18:14-17 — His son who turns away from the wicked father shall live
> **Ezk 18:20 — The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.**
> Ezk 18:21-24 — The wicked who turns can live; the righteous who turns shall die
> **Ezk 18:27 — Again, when the wicked [man] turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.**
> Ezk 18:31-32 — "Make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn [yourselves], and live ye."

**Note:** The nephesh (H5315) is the grammatical subject of the verb "die" (tamut, H4191). The text does not say "the body of the person will die" — the nephesh itself is what dies. This is stated twice (vv.4 and 20) for emphasis. God's concern ("why will ye die?") presupposes that death is not inevitable — turning leads to life.

---

#### Matthew 10:28 — God can destroy both soul and body

> **Mat 10:28 — And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.**

> [Context: Mat 10:26-33]
> Mat 10:26 — Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed...
> Mat 10:27 — What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light...
> **Mat 10:28 — And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.**
> Mat 10:29-31 — God notes every sparrow and numbers hairs; fear God not men
> Mat 10:32-33 — Confessing/denying Christ

**Note:** The verse establishes three things:
1. Men can kill the body but NOT the soul — so the soul has a conditional durability men cannot destroy
2. God CAN destroy both soul AND body in hell (gehenna)
3. The soul is not beyond destruction — it is beyond human destruction but not beyond divine destruction

This verse does NOT say the soul is inherently immortal — it says men cannot kill it. God can destroy it.

---

#### Revelation 16:3 — Every living soul died

> Rev 16:1 — And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
> Rev 16:2 — And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth...
> **Rev 16:3 — And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead [man]: and every living soul died in the sea.**

**Note:** πᾶσα ψυχὴ ζωῆς (pasa psyche zoes) = "every living soul" — using the same construction as "living soul" (nephesh chayyah) in Gen 1:20,21,24 (aquatic creatures). The statement "died" (apethanen, aorist indicative) = the soul as subject of death. In apocalyptic context, this may apply specifically to sea creatures, but the grammar confirms that psyche (soul) can be the subject of dying.

### SECTION E: OT Anticipations of Immortality/Resurrection

---

#### Daniel 12:1-3, 13 — Two resurrections, two destinies

> **Dan 12:1 — And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation [even] to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.**
> **Dan 12:2 — And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt.**
> **Dan 12:3 — And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.**
> ...
> **Dan 12:13 — But go thou thy way till the end [be]: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.**

**Hebrew Key Terms (Dan 12:2):**
- יְּשֵׁנֵי = "those sleeping" (yashen) — same root as sleep-metaphor for death in OT
- אַדְמַת־עָפָ֖ר = "dust of the ground/soil" — same words as Gen 2:7 (adamah + aphar)
- יָקִיצוּ = "shall awake" (quts, Hiphil imperfect) — future awakening from sleep
- חַיֵּי עֹולָם = "chayyei olam" = "life of eternity" = everlasting life
- דִרְאֹון עֹולָם = "direaon olam" = "everlasting contempt/abhorrence"

**Note:** This is the clearest OT text describing a general resurrection with two destinies. The state of the dead is described as "sleeping in the dust" — not as conscious activity in any realm. Daniel himself is told "thou shalt rest" (sleep) and "stand in thy lot at the end of the days" — a future event, not an immediate post-death experience.

#### Isaiah 25:6-9 — Death swallowed up in victory

> Isa 25:6 — And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things...
> **Isa 25:7 — And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.**
> **Isa 25:8 — He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken [it].**
> **Isa 25:9 — And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this [is] our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this [is] the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.**

**Note:** Paul quotes Isa 25:8 in 1 Cor 15:54 ("Death is swallowed up in victory"). The eschatological context is clear: this is a future event ("in that day"). God will "swallow up death" — implying death currently exists as a power that will be defeated.

#### Isaiah 26:14, 19 — The dead shall live

> **Isa 26:14 — [They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.**
> ...
> **Isa 26:19 — Thy dead [men] shall live, [together with] my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew [is as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.**

**Note:** Isaiah 26:14 describes the wicked dead as those who "shall not live" and "shall not rise" — suggesting that resurrection is conditional, not universal in the same way. Isaiah 26:19 is the positive counter: God's dead shall live and arise. "Dwell in dust" echoes Dan 12:2 (dust of the earth) and Gen 3:19 (dust thou art).

#### Hosea 13:14 — I will redeem them from death

> Hos 13:4 — Yet I [am] the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for [there is] no saviour beside me.
> ...
> **Hos 13:14 — I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.**

**Note:** Paul quotes Hos 13:14 in 1 Cor 15:55 ("O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"). The OT text is God's declaration of victory over death and Sheol (grave). The power of the grave (Sheol) over the dead is real — redemption from it requires divine action.

---

#### Psalms 49:7-9, 14-15 — No man can ransom his brother

> **Psa 49:7 — None of [them] can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:**
> **Psa 49:8 — (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)**
> **Psa 49:9 — That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.**
> ...
> **Psa 49:14 — Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.**
> **Psa 49:15 — But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.**

**Note:** The text establishes:
1. No human can redeem another human from death (vv.7-8)
2. The goal of redemption = living forever without seeing corruption (v.9)
3. The wicked are laid in the grave, consumed by death (v.14)
4. But God CAN redeem the soul from the power of the grave (v.15)

This reinforces that immortality/freedom from corruption requires divine redemption — it is not a human inherent property.

### SECTION F: Life in Christ

---

#### John 3:14-18, 36 — Everlasting life through belief in the Son

> John 3:14 — And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
> **John 3:15 — That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.**
> **John 3:16 — For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.**
> 3:17 — For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
> 3:18 — He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already...
> **3:36 — He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.**

**Note:** The contrast: those who believe have eternal life; those who do not believe "shall not see life." This implies that "life" (eternal life) is not a universal human possession — it is acquired through faith in the Son.

---

#### John 5:21-29 — Life in the Son; the resurrection of all

> **John 5:21 — For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth [them]; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.**
> John 5:22 — For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:
> **John 5:24 — Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.**
> **John 5:25 — Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.**
> **John 5:26 — For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;**
> 5:27 — And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
> **John 5:28 — Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,**
> **John 5:29 — And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.**

**Note on John 5:26:** "Life in himself" (zoe en heauto) is a divine attribute. The Father has it as an intrinsic property; the Father gave it to the Son. This is NOT stated of humans — humans do not have "life in themselves" as a divine prerogative. The resurrection of all (v.28-29) includes both the righteous and wicked — two resurrection destinies.

---

#### John 10:27-30 — Eternal life given to his sheep

> John 10:27 — My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
> **John 10:28 — And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand.**
> John 10:29 — My Father, which gave [them] me, is greater than all; and no [man] is able to pluck [them] out of my Father's hand.

**Note:** Jesus says "I give unto them eternal life" — this is Christ's gift, not a human inherent property. The security of "never perish" and "no man pluck them out" is dependent on Christ's giving and the Father's keeping.

---

#### John 11:23-27 — I am the resurrection and the life

> John 11:23 — Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
> John 11:24 — Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
> **John 11:25 — Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:**
> **John 11:26 — And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?**
> John 11:27 — She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.

**Note:** The resurrection is located in CHRIST ("I am the resurrection, and the life"), not in a human faculty. Belief in Christ is the condition for not dying (v.26). Martha already understood the correct framework: resurrection "at the last day" (v.24), not immediate at death.

---

#### John 17:1-3 — Eternal life defined

> John 17:1 — These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:
> **John 17:2 — As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.**
> **John 17:3 — And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.**

**Note:** Eternal life is defined as knowing God (the only true God) and Jesus Christ. The Father "gave" authority to the Son to give eternal life. This gift is the subject — not a human inherent property.

---

#### 1 John 5:9-13 — Life is in the Son

> 1 John 5:9 — If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.
> 1 John 5:10 — He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
> **1 John 5:11 — And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.**
> **1 John 5:12 — He that hath the Son hath life; [and] he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.**
> 1 John 5:13 — These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

**Note:** The structure of 1 John 5:11-12 creates a tight logical formula:
- Premise 1: Eternal life is in the Son
- Premise 2: Those who have the Son have life
- Premise 3: Those who do not have the Son do not have life
- Conclusion: Life (eternal life) is exclusively available through the Son; there is no independent human source of it

---

#### Romans 5:12-21; 6:23 — Death through Adam; life through Christ

> **Rom 5:12 — Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:**
> 5:13 — (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.)
> **5:14 — Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.**
> 5:15 — But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
> ...
> **5:17 — For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)**
> 5:18 — Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto justification of life.
> 5:19 — For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
> 5:20 — Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
> **5:21 — That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.**

> **Rom 6:23 — For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.**

**Note:** The structure of Romans 5-6:
- Death through one man (Adam) — sin is the mechanism; death is the result
- Death "reigned" as a universal condition
- Life ("eternal life") comes through Jesus Christ — it is a gift (charisma), not a natural human attribute
- Rom 6:23 is the summary axiom: sin's wage = death; God's gift = eternal life through Christ

#### Romans 8:10-11, 18-23 — Mortal body; waiting for adoption

> **Rom 8:10 — And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness.**
> **Rom 8:11 — But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.**
> ...
> Rom 8:18 — For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
> **Rom 8:19 — For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.**
> Rom 8:20 — For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected [the same] in hope,
> **Rom 8:21 — Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.**
> Rom 8:22 — For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
> **Rom 8:23 — And not only [they], but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body.**

**Note:** Rom 8:23 is key: believers who have the Spirit STILL wait for "the redemption of our body" — the body is not yet redeemed. The "adoption" (huiothesia) is both present (in Christ) and future (full body-redemption). The mortal body (8:11) awaits quickening/immortalization.

---

### SECTION G: Luke 20:36 — Equal unto angels, cannot die

> **Luke 20:34 — And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:**
> **Luke 20:35 — But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:**
> **Luke 20:36 — Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.**
> Luke 20:37 — Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
> **Luke 20:38 — For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.**

**Note:** The state described in Luke 20:36 ("cannot die any more") is a POST-RESURRECTION state, not a present human condition. "They which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection" — this is a future event (the resurrection). Only AFTER the resurrection can they "not die any more." The current state of the dead (awaiting resurrection) is not the same as the post-resurrection state.

---

### SECTION H: Philippians 3:20-21 and 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18

#### Philippians 3:20-21 — Our body shall be fashioned like his glorious body

> **Phil 3:20 — For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:**
> **Phil 3:21 — Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.**

**Note:** "Shall change" (metaschematizo, future) = a future transformation. "Our vile body" (soma tes tapeinoseos = the body of our humiliation/lowliness) transformed to be "like unto his glorious body" (soma tes doxes). This body transformation is the future reception of immortality/incorruption at resurrection.

---

#### 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 — The dead in Christ shall rise

> 1 Thess 4:13 — But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
> **1 Thess 4:14 — For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.**
> 1 Thess 4:15 — For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
> **1 Thess 4:16 — For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:**
> **1 Thess 4:17 — Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.**
> 1 Thess 4:18 — Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

**Note:** The deceased believers are described as "asleep" (4:13,14,15). Their awakening/resurrection is a future event at the Lord's coming. The sequence: (1) Lord descends; (2) dead in Christ rise first; (3) living are caught up together with them. The comfort Paul offers is the resurrection, not an intermediate conscious state.

## Cross-Testament Parallels

### Key Parallel Pairs

**Gen 3:22 ↔ Rev 2:7; 22:2,14**
- Gen 3:22,24: Tree of life blocked; man expelled
- Rev 2:7: "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life"
- Rev 22:2,14: Tree of life restored; blessed are those who have right to it
- The bookend structure: immortality lost in Eden → immortality restored in new creation

**Gen 3:22 ↔ John 3:16**
- Gen 3:22: "lest he... live for ever" (olam)
- John 3:16: "have everlasting life" (aionion = Greek equivalent of olam)
- The top NT parallel for Gen 3:22 is John 3:16 (0.408 score) — directly connecting the blocked "live for ever" of Eden with the restored "everlasting life" through Christ

**Isa 25:8 ↔ 1 Cor 15:54**
- Isa 25:8: "He will swallow up death in victory"
- 1 Cor 15:54: "then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory"
- Paul explicitly quotes Isaiah — the OT promise fulfilled at resurrection

**Hos 13:14 ↔ 1 Cor 15:55**
- Hos 13:14: "O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction"
- 1 Cor 15:55: "O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory?"
- The OT apostrophe to Death/Sheol is the antecedent for Paul's resurrection triumph cry

**Dan 12:2 ↔ John 5:28-29**
- Dan 12:2: "many that sleep in the dust... shall awake... some to everlasting life, some to shame"
- John 5:28-29: "all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth... resurrection of life... resurrection of damnation"
- Two-destiny resurrection: OT and NT use nearly identical language

**1 Tim 6:16 ↔ 1 Tim 1:17**
- 1 Tim 1:17: "the King eternal, immortal (aphthartos), invisible, the only wise God"
- 1 Tim 6:16: "who only (monos) hath immortality (athanasia)"
- Same letter, same author, same subject — the exclusive divine possession of immortality

## Additional Context Passages

### Romans 1:20 — Eternal power of God

> **Rom 1:20 — For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:**

**Note:** The top NT parallel for 1 Tim 6:16 (after 1 Tim 1:17) is Rom 1:20 — connecting God's "eternal power" with the unapproachable immortality theme.

### Hebrews 2:14-15 — Christ partook of death to destroy him that had the power of death

> **Heb 2:14 — Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;**
> **Heb 2:15 — And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.**

**Note:** The present human condition: subject to fear of death, in bondage. Christ's purpose: to destroy the power of death through his own death. This connects directly to 2 Tim 1:10 (Christ abolished death) and 1 Cor 15:26 (the last enemy destroyed is death).

### Hebrews 9:27 — Appointed unto death

> **Heb 9:27 — And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:**

**Note:** The "appointment" (apokeimai) of death for all humans is stated as a universal fact. Death is the normal human experience, not immortality. What follows death is judgment — resurrection judgment (cf. Dan 12:2; John 5:28-29).
