# Who Has Immortality?

## Question
Who possesses immortality according to Scripture? Is the human soul inherently immortal, or is immortality a conditional divine gift? This study examines athanasia (G110), aphtharsia (G861), thnetos (G2349), aphthartos (G862), phthora (G5356), and diaphthora (G1312) -- every NT occurrence of these terms -- along with all related passages from Nave's Topical Bible on immortality, mortality, eternal life, and life as a divine gift.

## Summary Answer
Scripture applies immortality vocabulary exclusively to God as a present possession (1 Tim 6:16; 1 Tim 1:17; Rom 1:23) and to believers as a future acquisition at the resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54). The human body/flesh is called "mortal" (thnetos) in six NT passages. Man is called "corruptible" (phthartos) in direct contrast to the "uncorruptible" (aphthartos) God (Rom 1:23). Eternal life is consistently presented as a gift (Rom 6:23), a promise (Tit 1:2; 1 John 2:25), something to seek (Rom 2:7), and something conditional on relationship with Christ (1 John 5:11-12). No NT passage applies athanasia, aphtharsia, or aphthartos to the human soul as an inherent, present possession.

## Key Verses
- **1 Timothy 6:16** -- "Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto."
- **1 Corinthians 15:53-54** -- "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
- **Romans 2:7** -- "To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life."
- **Romans 1:23** -- "And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man."
- **Romans 6:23** -- "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
- **1 John 5:11-12** -- "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."
- **2 Timothy 1:10** -- "Our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel."
- **John 3:16** -- "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Man does not inherently possess immortality | E1, E2, E3 | Neutral | E1: God ONLY has athanasia (monos = exclusively). E2: Mortals MUST put on athanasia (they do not have it). E3: Aphtharsia must be sought (one does not seek what one has). All three facts converge: immortality is not an inherent human possession. | N002 |
| N2 | Immortality is acquired at the resurrection, not before | E2, E13, E24 | Neutral | E2: mortal puts on immortality (1 Cor 15:53-54). E13: dead raised incorruptible (1 Cor 15:52). E24: those in the resurrection "can die no more" (Luke 20:36, ouketi = no longer). The timing is at the resurrection. | N008 *NEW* |
| N3 | Eternal life is conditional on relationship with Christ | E25, E26, E29, E30, E32, E46 | Cond. | E25: "whosoever believeth" -- conditional. E26: unbeliever "shall not see life." E29: without coming to Christ, they lack life. E30: "ye have no life in you" without Christ. E32: Jesus "gives" eternal life. E46: "he that hath not the Son hath not life." Six explicit statements from two authors (Jesus, John) state that without Christ there is no life. No reader of any position can deny these texts say this. | N009 *NEW* |
| N4 | The transition from mortality to immortality is a future divine act, not a present human condition | E2, E8, E11, E14, E15, E22 | Neutral | E2: mortal MUST put on immortality (future). E8: God WILL quicken mortal bodies (future). E11: sown in corruption, RAISED in incorruption (future). E14: death SHALL be destroyed (future). E15: in Christ all SHALL be made alive (future). E22: God WILL swallow up death (future). Every passage uses future tense or necessity language. | N010 *NEW* |
| N5 | The human condition is mortality and corruption; God's nature is immortality and incorruption | E1, E5, E6, E7, E9, E11, E39 | Neutral | E1: God alone has athanasia. E5: God is aphthartos. E6: God is aphthartos; man is phthartos (explicit contrast in same verse). E7: human body is thnetos. E9: human flesh is thnetos. E11: body sown in phthora. E39: creation in bondage of phthora. The text consistently places God and humans on opposite sides of the mortality/immortality divide. | N011 *NEW* |
| N6 | Death is the result of sin and entered through Adam | E15, E36, E37 | Neutral | E15: "by man came death" (1 Cor 15:21). E36: "by one man's offence death reigned" (Rom 5:17). E37: "the wages of sin is death" (Rom 6:23). Death is caused by sin and entered through one man. Both sides of the debate acknowledge this. | N012 *NEW* |
| N7 | Without Christ, the alternative to eternal life is perishing/death, not continued existence in torment | E25, E26, E30, E37, E38 | Cond. | E25: "not perish, but have everlasting life" -- perish is the alternative. E26: "shall not see life" -- not seeing life, not seeing torment. E30: "no life in you" -- absence of life. E37: death vs. eternal life. E38: corruption vs. everlasting life. Five explicit texts present the alternatives as life vs. death/perishing/corruption. None of these texts mentions ongoing conscious torment as the alternative. | N013 *NEW* |

**N-tier verification (3-question test applied to each):**

- **N1:** (1) Universal agreement: an ECT scholar acknowledges 1 Tim 6:16 says "only," 1 Cor 15:53 says "must put on," and Rom 2:7 says "seek." YES -- the texts say this. (2) No interpretation required: "only" means exclusively; "must put on" means does not currently have; "seek" means pursue what is not yet held. YES. (3) Zero added: YES. PASSES.

- **N2:** (1) Universal agreement: both sides agree the resurrection transforms mortal bodies. YES. (2) No interpretation: the texts explicitly place the transition at the resurrection and "last day." YES. (3) Zero added: YES. PASSES.

- **N3:** (1) An ECT scholar would agree that these texts state eternal life is conditional on relationship with Christ. YES. The disagreement is about what happens to those without Christ (ECT: eternal torment; Cond.: perishing). But the conditional nature of eternal life is stated by the texts themselves. However: classifying this as Conditionalist is because the texts state those without Christ "have not life" and "shall not see life" -- ECT holds they DO have a form of continued existence. The texts state they "hath not life." Positional classification: Conditionalist, because one side must qualify what "hath not life" means. (2) No interpretation: YES. (3) Zero added: YES. PASSES.

- **N4:** (1) Both sides agree the resurrection involves a future transformation. YES. (2) One meaning: "must put on" and "shall be" are future. YES. (3) Zero added: YES. PASSES.

- **N5:** (1) Both sides acknowledge the textual contrast between God (immortal/incorruptible) and humans (mortal/corruptible). YES. (2) No interpretation: the contrast is in the same verse (Rom 1:23). YES. (3) Zero added: YES. PASSES.

- **N6:** (1) Both sides agree death entered through Adam. YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N7:** (1) Would an ECT scholar necessarily agree? The texts cited present the alternative to life as "perish," "death," "corruption," "shall not see life," "no life in you." An ECT scholar would argue that additional texts (not cited here) describe the alternative differently. But the N-item states what THESE texts present as the alternative. An ECT scholar must acknowledge that these specific texts use perish/death/corruption language, not torment language. However, they would dispute that this is the COMPLETE picture. The N-item says "the alternative to eternal life is perishing/death, not continued existence in torment" -- this requires that these texts are taken at face value without qualification. An ECT scholar would add qualification. This pushes toward inference rather than necessary implication. RECONSIDER: Reclassify as I-A rather than N. The observation that these texts use perish/death language is E-level. The conclusion that THIS IS the alternative (with no other option) requires systematizing. Move to I-table.

**CORRECTION: N7 reclassified as I-A.** See I-table below (I1).

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the alternative to eternal life is perishing/death/cessation, not continued conscious existence in torment | I-A | Cond. | E25 (John 3:16): "not perish, but have everlasting life." E26 (John 3:36): "shall not see life." E30 (John 6:53): "no life in you." E37 (Rom 6:23): "wages of sin is death; gift of God is eternal life." E38 (Gal 6:8): "reap corruption" vs. "reap everlasting life." E40 (2 Thess 1:9): "everlasting destruction." E45 (2 Pet 2:12): "utterly perish in their own corruption." E17 (Ps 49:12, 20): "man is like the beasts that perish." | All vocabulary and concepts are drawn from the E/N tables. It is an inference because it systematizes multiple E/N items into a comprehensive claim about what the alternative to eternal life IS. Individual passages present their own contrasts; the claim unifies them into a doctrine. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I2 | Humans possess an immortal soul that survives death consciously | I-D | ECT | E1 (1 Tim 6:16): God ONLY has immortality. E2 (1 Cor 15:53-54): mortals MUST put on immortality. E3 (Rom 2:7): immortality must be sought. E6 (Rom 1:23): man is corruptible. N1: man does not inherently possess immortality. N5: mortality/corruption is the human condition. (From etc-01) E016 (Ezek 18:4): soul that sins dies. E028 (Matt 10:28): God can destroy soul and body. | The concept "immortal soul" does not appear in any E or N statement. It requires overriding E1 (redefining "only" to mean "only in a certain sense"), E2 (redefining "mortal" to mean "the body only"), N1 (adding that the soul is an exception), and E016/E028 (redefining "die" and "destroy" as applied to the soul). | #1 (adds "immortal soul" concept), #2 (redefines "only," "mortal," "die," "destroy"), #3 (applies Platonic philosophical framework) |
| I3 | God's exclusive possession of athanasia (1 Tim 6:16) refers only to self-existent, underived immortality; humans may still possess a derived, God-given form of immortality | I-C | ECT-direction | E1 (1 Tim 6:16): "Who only hath immortality." E5 (1 Tim 1:17): God is "immortal." | The text says God "only" has it. The qualification "only self-existent immortality" adds a distinction the text does not make. 1 Tim 6:16 does not say "only self-existent immortality" -- it says "only immortality" (monos echon athanasian). The derived/underived distinction is imported from outside the text. Does not directly override E1 (it qualifies it), so I-C rather than I-D. | #1 (adds derived/underived distinction), #3 (external theological framework) |
| I4 | "Mortal" (thnetos) in Paul's letters refers only to the body, not to the whole person; the soul/spirit is exempt from mortality | I-C | ECT-direction | E7 (Rom 6:12): "mortal body." E8 (Rom 8:11): "mortal bodies." E9 (2 Cor 4:11): "mortal flesh." E10 (2 Cor 5:4): "mortality." E2 (1 Cor 15:53-54): "this mortal must put on immortality." | In Rom 6:12, 8:11, and 2 Cor 4:11, thnetos modifies "body" or "flesh." However, in 1 Cor 15:53-54, "this mortal" (touto to thneton) is used absolutely -- it is not "this mortal body" but "this mortal [entity/thing]." The claim that the soul is exempt requires adding information the text does not state. Paul never names an immortal counterpart to the mortal body. | #1 (adds soul-exemption concept), #3 (imports body-soul dualism framework) |
| I5 | Eternal life in John's Gospel refers to a present quality of spiritual life, not to future immortality; therefore having or not having "life" does not bear on the immortality question | I-C | ECT-direction | E25 (John 3:16), E26 (John 3:36), E30 (John 6:53), E46 (1 John 5:11-12). | John does use "has eternal life" in present tense (John 3:36; 5:24; 6:47). This shows that zoe aionios has a present dimension. However, Jesus also connects eternal life to the future resurrection repeatedly: "I will raise him up at the last day" (John 6:40, 44, 54; E31). The claim that "life" language does not bear on immortality requires separating John's "life" concept from Paul's "immortality" concept -- a framework the text does not prescribe. | #3 (external hermeneutical framework separating John from Paul), #5 (systematizing) |
| I6 | The seeking, gifting, and putting-on language for eternal life/immortality refers only to glorification (the resurrection body), not to the existence of the person; even without receiving this gift, the person continues to exist | I-B | ECT-direction | FOR: E2 (1 Cor 15:53: this mortal puts on immortality -- could refer to the body receiving a new nature), E24 (Luke 20:36: "can die no more" applies to resurrected saints, implying a bodily transformation), E8 (Rom 8:11: mortal BODIES quickened). AGAINST: E1 (1 Tim 6:16: God ONLY has immortality -- no body/soul distinction made), E30 (John 6:53: "no life IN YOU" -- the whole person lacks life), E46 (1 John 5:12: "hath not life" -- the person, not the body), E37 (Rom 6:23: death is wages -- not "bodily death only"), E25 (John 3:16: the person perishes, not the body). | Both sides cite E/N statements. ECT cites texts where thnetos modifies "body" or where the resurrection transformation is described. Conditionalism cites texts where the whole person is addressed (no life "in you," the person "perishes," "hath not life"). The claim requires restricting immortality language to the body alone while the texts also apply life/death language to the whole person. | #2 (choosing between readings: body-only or whole-person), #5 (systematizing) |
| I7 | Luke 20:38 ("all live unto him") teaches that the patriarchs are currently alive in God's presence, demonstrating consciousness after death | I-C | ECT-direction | E24 (Luke 20:36-38): Jesus says the resurrected "can die no more; they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection." He then argues "he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him." | Jesus' argument is for the RESURRECTION (v.37: "Now that the dead ARE RAISED"). The statement "all live unto him" functions as the basis for why God will raise them, not as a description of their current conscious state. The passage is about resurrection, and "live unto him" means God regards them as living because their resurrection is certain. Reading it as "currently alive in heaven" requires adding a framework the text does not state. | #3 (imports conscious intermediate state framework), #4b (cross-references to a doctrine of intermediate state not stated in this passage) |
| I8 | The Bible teaches conditional immortality: humans are mortal, immortality is only through Christ at the resurrection, and those who reject Christ ultimately cease to exist | I-A | Cond. | E1-E4 (God alone has immortality; mortals put it on at resurrection; it must be sought; Christ brought it to light). E6, E7 (man is corruptible, mortal). E15, E36, E37 (death through Adam; wages of sin is death). E25, E26, E30, E46 (perish, not see life, no life, hath not life). E40, E45 (everlasting destruction; perish in corruption). N1 (man does not inherently possess immortality). N2 (immortality acquired at resurrection). N3 (eternal life conditional on Christ). N5 (human condition is mortality). N6 (death from sin through Adam). | All components are drawn from E/N statements. The inference systematizes multiple lines of evidence -- immortality vocabulary, mortality vocabulary, conditional-life passages, perish/death contrast passages -- into a comprehensive doctrinal claim. It is an inference because it draws the comprehensive conclusion from many texts. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS connections between immortality passages and conditional-life passages via shared vocabulary: athanasia/thnetos, zoe/thanatos) |
| I9 | The phrase "immortal soul" is a biblical teaching derived from the totality of Scripture even though the exact phrase does not appear | I-D | ECT | E1 (1 Tim 6:16): God ONLY has immortality. N1: Man does not inherently possess immortality. N5: Human condition is mortality/corruption. (From etc-01) E016 (Ezek 18:4): soul dies. E028 (Matt 10:28): God can destroy soul and body. | No E or N statement uses the phrase "immortal soul" or attributes immortality to the human soul. The claim requires: (1) adding a concept absent from the text ("immortal soul"), (2) overriding E1 (God ONLY has immortality), (3) overriding E016 (soul dies), (4) overriding E028 (God can destroy the soul). | #1 (adds absent concept), #2 (redefines "only," "die," "destroy"), #3 (imports extra-biblical framework) |

#### I-B Resolution: I6 -- Immortality/Life Language Refers Only to Glorification (Body), Not to the Person's Existence

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (immortality language = body-only; person continues to exist regardless): E2 (1 Cor 15:53: mortal puts on immortality -- context discusses the resurrection body), E7 (Rom 6:12: "mortal body"), E8 (Rom 8:11: "mortal bodies"), E9 (2 Cor 4:11: "mortal flesh"), E24 (Luke 20:36: inability to die is linked to the resurrection)
- AGAINST (immortality/life language = the whole person; without it, the person perishes): E1 (1 Tim 6:16: God ONLY has immortality -- no body/soul distinction), E25 (John 3:16: the person perishes), E26 (John 3:36: shall not SEE life), E30 (John 6:53: "no life IN YOU"), E37 (Rom 6:23: death is wages of sin -- not "bodily death only"), E46 (1 John 5:11-12: "hath not life" -- the person), E17 (Ps 49:12, 20: man perishes like beasts), E38 (Gal 6:8: reap corruption vs. everlasting life), E40 (2 Thess 1:9: everlasting destruction), E45 (2 Pet 2:12: utterly perish in their own corruption)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E2 | Contextually Clear | The passage discusses the resurrection body (1 Cor 15:35-49), so "this mortal" in v.53 is within a body-transformation context. However, "this mortal" (touto to thneton) is used absolutely, not as "this mortal body." |
| E7 | Plain | "Your mortal body" -- directly says "body." |
| E8 | Plain | "Your mortal bodies" -- directly says "bodies." |
| E9 | Plain | "Our mortal flesh" -- directly says "flesh." |
| E24 | Contextually Clear | "Cannot die anymore" is tied to the resurrection state. |
| E1 | Plain | "God only hath immortality" -- no body/soul distinction. Universal scope. Didactic. |
| E25 | Plain | "Not perish, but have everlasting life" -- the person perishes or has life. Direct teaching from Jesus. |
| E26 | Plain | "Shall not see life" -- the person, not the body. |
| E30 | Plain | "No life in you" -- in the whole person. Direct statement from Jesus. |
| E37 | Plain | "Wages of sin is death; gift of God is eternal life" -- death/life applied to the person. Didactic. |
| E46 | Plain | "He that hath not the Son hath not life" -- the person. Didactic. |
| E17 | Plain | "Man is like the beasts that perish" -- the person perishes. Wisdom psalm. |
| E38 | Plain | "Reap corruption" vs. "reap everlasting life" -- the outcomes for the person. |
| E40 | Plain | "Everlasting destruction" -- applied to the disobedient. |
| E45 | Plain | "Utterly perish in their own corruption." |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR (body-only reading): 3 Plain items (E7, E8, E9 -- these say "mortal body/bodies/flesh") + 2 Contextually Clear (E2, E24). These establish that thnetos is applied to the body in several passages.
AGAINST (whole-person reading): 10 Plain items (E1, E25, E26, E30, E37, E46, E17, E38, E40, E45). These apply life/death/perishing/immortality to the whole person without distinguishing body from soul. Multiple authors: Paul, Jesus, John, the psalmist, Peter.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The plain statements that address the whole person (E1, E25, E26, E30, E37, E46) govern the reading of the contextually clear statements about the body (E2, E7-E9). That thnetos sometimes modifies "body" does not establish that only the body is mortal -- it establishes that the body is mortal. The whole-person statements add that the PERSON perishes, has no life, and does not see life without Christ. The body-specific statements are consistent with whole-person mortality; the body-only reading requires adding a soul-exemption the text does not state.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
Plain statements on the whole-person side (10 items from 5+ authors, didactic genre, universal scope) vs. contextually clear or body-specific statements on the other (5 items, all from Paul's discussions of the resurrection body). The plain whole-person statements govern the reading.

---

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases Scripture. Checked.
- Each uses plain lexical meaning without adding concepts. Checked.
- E-items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Checked.
- Items that state what both sides accept (grammatical facts, vocabulary observations) are classified Neutral. Items where one side must deny the textual observation to maintain their position are classified by position.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- All E-items classified as Conditionalist (E17, E25, E26, E29, E30, E32, E37, E38, E40, E45, E46) have full Tree 3 applications documented above.
- No E-items are classified as ECT. No verse in this study directly and didactically states that the human soul possesses inherent immortality. The passages commonly cited for ECT (Luke 16:19-31, Rev 14:10-11, Rev 20:10) are not within the scope of this study and will be examined in dedicated etc studies.
- All neutral E-items are textual observations both sides accept.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- Each N-item follows unavoidably from cited E-items. Checked.
- Three N-tier tests applied to each. All pass (documented above).
- N7 was reclassified to I1 (I-A) because the conclusion requires systematizing beyond what individual texts state.
- N3 (eternal life conditional on Christ) is classified Conditionalist because ECT must qualify what "hath not life" means to maintain their position.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1 (alternative is perishing): All components in E/N tables -> text-derived. Checked.
- I2 (immortal soul): Concept "immortal soul" absent from E/N -> external. Checked.
- I3 (self-existent vs. derived immortality): Distinction not in text -> external. Checked.
- I4 (thnetos = body only): Soul-exemption not in text -> external. Checked.
- I5 (John's "life" = quality, not immortality): Framework not in text -> external. Checked.
- I6 (immortality language = body-only): Components from E/N on both sides -> text-derived (I-B). Checked.
- I7 (Luke 20:38 = currently alive): Intermediate state framework not stated in Luke 20 -> external. Checked.
- I8 (conditional immortality): All components in E/N tables -> text-derived. Checked.
- I9 (immortal soul is biblical): Concept absent from E/N -> external. Checked.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value -> aligns -> I-A. Checked.
- I2: Requires E1 ("only") to mean "only self-existent," E016 ("die") to mean "spiritual death," etc. -> conflicts -> I-D. Checked.
- I3: Does not directly override E1 (it qualifies it, which is not the same as overriding) -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I4: Does not directly override E7-E9 (the body IS mortal); adds that the soul is exempt -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I5: Does not override E25-E30; offers alternative reading -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I6: Requires E1 to mean "body-only," E25 (perish) to mean "bodily perish," E46 (hath not life) to mean "hath not glorified life" -> conflicts -> I-B. Checked.
- I7: Does not override E24; adds interpretation -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I8: Does not require any E/N to mean other than lexical value -> aligns -> I-A. Checked.
- I9: Requires E1, E016, E028 to mean something other than what they say -> conflicts -> I-D. Checked.

**Step E: Consistency checks.**
- I-A (I1, I8): Each requires only criterion #5 (systematizing). I8 also uses #4a (SIS with verified connections). Confirmed.
- I-B (I6): Has E/N items on BOTH sides. Confirmed.
- I-C (I3, I4, I5, I7): None overrides an E/N statement. Confirmed.
- I-D (I2, I9): Both override multiple E/N statements. Confirmed.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- 1 Cor 15:45 quoting Gen 2:7: verified textual connection (direct OT quotation). #4a.
- 1 Cor 15:54 quoting Isa 25:8: verified textual connection (direct OT quotation). #4a.
- Acts 2:27, 31 and Acts 13:35-37 quoting Ps 16:10: verified textual connection. #4a.
- John 6:53 + 1 John 5:12: same author, shared vocabulary (zoe, echo). #4a.
- Rom 6:23 + Gal 6:8: same author, parallel structure (death/corruption vs. eternal life). #4a.
- 1 Cor 15:53-54 + 2 Cor 5:4: same author, shared vocabulary (thnetos, katapino). #4a.
- I7 connection (Luke 20:38 -> conscious intermediate state): no verified textual link between "all live unto him" and the doctrine of conscious intermediate existence. Luke 20:38 is Jesus' argument FOR the resurrection. #4b (inference trigger). Confirmed.

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture Explicitly States or Necessarily Implies)

1. God alone (monos) possesses immortality (athanasia) (1 Tim 6:16).
2. God is incorruptible (aphthartos); man is corruptible (phthartos) (Rom 1:23; 1 Tim 1:17).
3. The human body/flesh is mortal (thnetos) (Rom 6:12; 8:11; 2 Cor 4:11; 5:4).
4. Mortals must "put on" immortality (athanasia) at the resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54).
5. Immortality (aphtharsia) must be sought (Rom 2:7).
6. Christ abolished death and brought life and immortality (aphtharsia) to light through the gospel (2 Tim 1:10).
7. Death entered through Adam; in Adam all die (1 Cor 15:21-22; Rom 5:12, 17).
8. The wages of sin is death; the gift of God is eternal life (Rom 6:23).
9. Man was barred from the tree of life to prevent living forever (Gen 3:22-24).
10. Man does not inherently possess immortality (N1, from E1 + E2 + E3).
11. Immortality is acquired at the resurrection, not before (N2, from E2 + E13 + E24).
12. Eternal life is conditional on relationship with Christ (N3, from E25, E26, E29, E30, E32, E46).
13. He that has the Son has life; he that has not the Son has not life (1 John 5:12).
14. Those who believe shall not perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16). Those who believe not shall not see life (John 3:36).
15. Without Christ, "ye have no life in you" (John 6:53).
16. The dead are raised incorruptible; the corruptible puts on incorruption (1 Cor 15:52-54).
17. The whole creation is in bondage of corruption, awaiting the redemption of the body (Rom 8:21, 23).
18. The resurrected can "die no more" -- implying they could die before (Luke 20:36).
19. Man is like the beasts that perish (Ps 49:12, 20).
20. Bodily decay (diaphthora) is the normal human post-death experience; Christ's body was the exception (Acts 2:29-31; 13:36-37).

## What CANNOT Be Said (Not Explicitly Stated or Necessarily Implied by Scripture)

1. **It cannot be said that Scripture teaches humans have an "immortal soul."** The phrase does not appear in the Bible. No E or N statement attributes athanasia, aphtharsia, or aphthartos to the human soul. E1 states God ONLY has immortality. E016 (Ezek 18:4) states the soul dies. E028 (Matt 10:28) states God can destroy the soul.

2. **It cannot be said that 1 Tim 6:16 ("God only hath immortality") means only "self-existent" immortality.** The text does not qualify monos. The derived/underived distinction is not present in the passage. This reading requires importing a distinction from outside the text (I3, classified I-C).

3. **It cannot be said that "mortal" (thnetos) applies only to the body while the soul is immortal.** Paul never states the soul is immortal. In 1 Cor 15:53, "this mortal" is used absolutely without restricting the referent to the body alone. No text names an immortal counterpart to the mortal body.

4. **It cannot be said that eternal life is an inherent human possession.** Every passage examined presents eternal life as a gift (Rom 6:23), promise (Tit 1:2; 1 John 2:25), hope (Tit 3:7), something to seek (Rom 2:7), something to lay hold of (1 Tim 6:12), something given by Christ (John 10:28; 17:2), and located "in his Son" (1 John 5:11).

5. **It cannot be said that Luke 20:38 ("all live unto him") describes the patriarchs as presently conscious.** Jesus' argument is for the resurrection (v.37: "Now that the dead ARE RAISED"). The statement functions as the theological ground for future resurrection, not a description of current conscious existence.

6. **It cannot be said that any NT passage applies immortality vocabulary (athanasia, aphtharsia, aphthartos) to the human soul as an inherent, present possession.** All 18 NT occurrences of these three words describe either (a) God's nature, (b) the future resurrection state, (c) spiritual/heavenly qualities, or (d) something to seek or that Christ revealed. Zero occurrences describe the human soul or any part of the human being as presently immortal.

## Analysis

### The Immortality Word Families

This study examined all 18 NT occurrences of athanasia (3x), aphtharsia (8x), and aphthartos (7x), plus all 6 occurrences of thnetos, all 9 occurrences of phthora, and all 6 occurrences of diaphthora.

The distribution pattern is consistent across all terms: immortality/incorruptibility language is applied to God as an inherent attribute and to believers as a future acquisition at the resurrection. Mortality/corruption language is applied to the current human condition. No occurrence crosses this pattern.

### The "Only" (monos) of 1 Timothy 6:16

The word monos appears in a doxology to God that ascribes exclusive attributes: "the blessed and only (monos) Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only (monos) hath immortality." The same word monos is used in 1 Tim 1:17 ("the only wise God") and John 17:3 ("the only true God"). In each case, monos marks exclusivity without qualification. The text does not say "only self-existent immortality" or "only inherent immortality." It says "only hath immortality."

### The "Put On" (enduo) of 1 Corinthians 15

The verb enduo (to put on, clothe oneself with) in 1 Cor 15:53-54 describes the transition from mortality to immortality. Paul uses the same verb in Rom 13:14 ("put on the Lord Jesus Christ"), Gal 3:27 ("put on Christ"), Eph 6:11 ("put on the whole armour of God"), Col 3:10 ("put on the new man"). In every use, enduo describes putting on something one does not currently possess or wear. The mortal puts on immortality the way a person puts on clothing -- from a state of not having it to a state of having it.

### The Conditional Structure of Eternal Life

Across all authors examined -- Paul, John, Jesus (as reported by John), Peter, the psalmists, Isaiah -- eternal life is consistently described as conditional. The conditions vary in wording (believe, seek, come to Christ, do God's will, have the Son) but are consistent in substance: life is through Christ. Without Christ, the stated alternatives are: perish (John 3:16; 10:28), not see life (John 3:36), have no life (John 6:53; 1 John 5:12), death (Rom 6:23), corruption (Gal 6:8), and destruction (2 Thess 1:9).

### The Absence of "Immortal Soul"

A search of all gathered evidence produces zero occurrences of the phrase "immortal soul" or any equivalent. No verse states "the soul is immortal," "the soul cannot die," "the soul lives forever," or "the soul possesses athanasia." The closest any text comes is Matt 10:28 -- but that verse states the opposite: God is able to DESTROY both soul and body in gehenna. Ezek 18:4 states the soul that sins SHALL DIE. These texts attribute mortality and destructibility to the soul.

### Cross-Study Connections with etc-01

This study confirms and deepens findings from etc-01 (What Is Man?):
- N002 (man does not inherently possess immortality) is confirmed and expanded by the complete word studies of athanasia, aphtharsia, aphthartos, and thnetos.
- N005 (the soul is mortal) from etc-01 is consistent with the finding that no immortality vocabulary is applied to the human soul.
- E024-E027 (the four core immortality verses from etc-01) are now examined with full word-study context and expanded circles of analysis.
- I001 (humans possess an immortal soul = I-D) from etc-01 is confirmed: the complete immortality word study reinforces that the concept requires overriding multiple E/N statements.

---

## Conclusion

This study examined 57 explicit statements, 6 necessary implications, and 9 inferences regarding who possesses immortality.

11 explicit statements use destruction/death/perishing/absence-of-life vocabulary (classified Conditionalist). 0 explicit statements attribute immortality to the human soul or describe humans as inherently immortal (no ECT E-items identified). 46 explicit statements are neutral textual observations accepted by all positions.

1 necessary implication is classified Conditionalist (eternal life conditional on Christ). 5 are neutral (man does not possess immortality, immortality acquired at resurrection, transition is future, human condition is mortality, death entered through Adam).

2 inferences (I-A) extend the explicit evidence: one synthesizes the alternative-to-life passages, the other systematizes conditional immortality as a comprehensive position. 1 inference (I-B) addresses whether immortality language refers only to the body; it was resolved Strong toward the whole-person reading (10 Plain items from 5+ authors on the whole-person side vs. 5 items on the body-specific side). 4 inferences (I-C) are compatible external frameworks offered by the ECT position (self-existent vs. derived immortality, body-only mortality, John's "life" as quality only, Luke 20:38 as present consciousness). 2 inferences (I-D) require overriding multiple E/N statements (the claim of an inherently immortal soul and the claim that "immortal soul" is a biblical teaching).
