### 1. Explicit Statements Table (E Tier)

*E tier = what the text directly says. Both sides must acknowledge these as textual facts.*

Items from etc5-01 that this study also cites are noted with their Master ID. New items receive the next available ID (starting after E060).

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | God "only [monos] hath immortality [athanasian, G110], dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto." | 1 Tim 6:16 | → Master E029 |
| E2 | God is called "King eternal, immortal [aphtharto, G862], invisible" — applying G862 (aphthartos/incorruptible) directly to God as a divine attribute. | 1 Tim 1:17 | NEW → E061 |
| E3 | "This corruptible must put on incorruption [aphtharsian, G861], and this mortal must put on immortality [athanasian, G110]." | 1 Cor 15:53 | → Master E031 |
| E4 | "When this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory." | 1 Cor 15:54 | → Master E032 |
| E5 | "It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption." The resurrection body is raised in aphtharsia (G861); the buried body is sown in phthora (corruption). | 1 Cor 15:42 | NEW → E062 |
| E6 | "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption." | 1 Cor 15:50 | NEW → E063 |
| E7 | "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible [aphthartoi, G862], and we shall be changed." | 1 Cor 15:52 | NEW → E064 |
| E8 | G110 (athanasia, immortality) appears only 3 times in the NT: 1 Tim 6:16 (God alone has it); 1 Cor 15:53 (mortals must put it on); 1 Cor 15:54 (when mortal puts it on). In no NT occurrence is athanasia a present human possession. | 1 Tim 6:16; 1 Cor 15:53-54 | → Master E054 |
| E9 | Humans "seek" immortality [aphtharsian, G861] — described as a goal to be attained by patient continuance in well-doing. | Rom 2:7 | → Master E030 |
| E10 | G2349 (thnetos, mortal) describes the present human body in all 6 NT occurrences (Rom 6:12; 8:11; 1 Cor 15:53-54; 2 Cor 4:11; 5:4). In no NT occurrence is a human body described as immortal in the present state. | All 6 thnetos occurrences | → Master E055 |
| E11 | "That mortality [to thneton, G2349] might be swallowed up of life" — Paul describes the present condition as mortality and the desired future as life swallowing up mortality. | 2 Cor 5:4 | NEW → E065 |
| E12 | "The glory of the uncorruptible [aphthartou, G862] God" is contrasted with "corruptible [phtharto, G5349] man." | Rom 1:23 | NEW → E066 |
| E13 | "As the Father hath life in himself [zoe en heauto]; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself." Life-in-oneself is a divine attribute given from Father to Son — not stated of any human. | John 5:26 | NEW → E067 |
| E14 | "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life." | 1 John 5:11-12 | NEW → E068 |
| E15 | "It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment." Death is described as a universal, divinely appointed human experience. | Heb 9:27 | NEW → E069 |
| E16 | "Lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever [wachay le-olam]." God expelled man and blocked the tree of life to prevent him from acquiring immortality — implying man did not already possess it. | Gen 3:22-24 | → Master E003 |
| E17 | To him that overcometh, Christ will "give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God." The tree of life is a future reward for overcomers, not a present possession. | Rev 2:7 | NEW → E070 |
| E18 | In the new Jerusalem, "the tree of life" bears fruit and its leaves are "for the healing of the nations"; those who "do his commandments" have "right to the tree of life." Access to the tree of life is an eschatological privilege. | Rev 22:2, 14 | NEW → E071 |
| E19 | "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." | Rom 6:23 | NEW → E072 |
| E20 | "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Death through Adam is universal in scope. | Rom 5:12 | NEW → E073 |
| E21 | "He that hath the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal [thneta] bodies by his Spirit." The quickening of mortal bodies is a future promise. | Rom 8:11 | NEW → E074 |
| E22 | "The soul [nephesh] that sinneth, it shall die [tamut]." (Stated twice in the same chapter.) The nephesh is the grammatical subject of the death predicate. | Ezk 18:4, 20 | → Master E024 |
| E23 | God "is able to destroy both soul [psyche] and body [soma] in hell [gehenna]." | Mat 10:28 | → Master E026 |
| E24 | "Every living soul [pasa psyche zoes] died in the sea." | Rev 16:3 | → Master E028 |
| E25 | "Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life [chayyei olam], and some to shame and everlasting contempt [direaon olam]." Daniel himself is told "thou shalt rest" until "the end of the days." | Dan 12:2-3, 13 | → Master E023 |
| E26 | "He will swallow up death in victory" — God's eschatological defeat of death is a future event. | Isa 25:8 | NEW → E075 |
| E27 | "Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust." The righteous dead will arise; their present state is described as "dwelling in dust." | Isa 26:19 | NEW → E076 |
| E28 | "[The wicked] are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise." | Isa 26:14 | NEW → E077 |
| E29 | "I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction." | Hos 13:14 | NEW → E078 |
| E30 | "None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: that he should still live for ever [chay le-olam], and not see corruption." No human can purchase endless life; it requires divine redemption. | Psa 49:7-9 | NEW → E079 |
| E31 | "God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me." The nephesh in the power of the grave requires God's redemption. | Psa 49:15 | NEW → E080 |
| E32 | "Christ Jesus, who hath abolished [katargeo] death, and hath brought life and immortality [aphtharsian, G861] to light through the gospel." Christ's appearing is the event that brought immortality to light. | 2 Tim 1:10 | NEW → E081 |
| E33 | "They which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead... Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of the resurrection." The deathless state ("cannot die any more") is explicitly post-resurrection, not the present state. | Luk 20:35-36 | NEW → E082 |
| E34 | "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." Death is currently an active enemy; its destruction is a future event. | 1 Cor 15:26 | NEW → E083 |
| E35 | "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." | 1 Cor 15:22 | NEW → E084 |
| E36 | "To an inheritance incorruptible [aphtharton, G862], and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you." The incorruptible inheritance is "reserved in heaven" and "ready to be revealed in the last time" — not yet received. | 1 Pet 1:3-5 | NEW → E085 |
| E37 | Christ "through death... destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage." All humans are described as in bondage to the fear of death throughout their lifetimes. | Heb 2:14-15 | NEW → E086 |
| E38 | Paul expresses "a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better." | Phil 1:23 | → Master E039 |
| E39 | Paul describes being "absent from the body" as being "present with the Lord" and calls this preferable. | 2 Cor 5:8 | → Master E038 |
| E40 | "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." Eternal life is Christ's to give to his sheep. | John 10:28 | NEW → E087 |
| E41 | "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life." | John 3:36 | NEW → E088 |

### 2. Necessary Implications Table (N Tier)

*N tier = what unavoidably follows from explicit statements. Stricter N-tier test applied.*

Items from etc5-01 are noted with their Master ID.

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | God currently possesses immortality (athanasia) exclusively; no creature currently possesses it as an inherent attribute. | E1 (1 Tim 6:16); E8 (E054) | 1 Tim 6:16 states God ALONE (monos) has athanasia. Only 3 NT occurrences of the word; in the other two (E3, E4), mortals must PUT ON immortality at a future event. The word "only" is unqualified. Every reader must acknowledge the grammar: monos = alone/only. | → Master N005 |
| N2 | Immortality (athanasia) and incorruption (aphtharsia/aphthartos) are, in the present age, attributes of God alone; humans are in the present age mortal (thnetos) and corruptible (phthartos). | E1 (1 Tim 6:16); E2 (1 Tim 1:17); E12 (Rom 1:23); E10 (all thnetos occurrences); E8 | The three positive words (G110, G861, G862) are never applied to present human beings anywhere in the NT. The two negative words (G2349, G5349) are applied to present human beings in every NT occurrence. This vocabulary distribution is an observable textual fact. | NEW → N013 |
| N3 | Mortals receive immortality at the resurrection — not at death, at birth, or at regeneration. | E3 (1 Cor 15:53); E4 (1 Cor 15:54); E7 (1 Cor 15:52); E33 (Luk 20:35-36); E8 | 1 Cor 15:53-54 explicitly states the mortal MUST PUT ON immortality; 15:52 specifies the timing: "at the last trump." Luk 20:36 explicitly states "cannot die any more" is a post-resurrection status. The text itself specifies the moment: the resurrection event. | → Master N006 (extends) |
| N4 | "Life in himself" (zoe en heauto) is a divine attribute, not a human attribute; humans receive life from an external source (the Son). | E13 (John 5:26); E14 (1 John 5:11-12) | John 5:26 explicitly says the Father has life in himself and has given the Son to have life in himself. It does not say this of humans. 1 John 5:11-12 explicitly says life is in the Son and having the Son = having life (not having the Son = not having life). Both sides must acknowledge these are factual statements about where life resides. | NEW → N014 |
| N5 | Man in the fallen state did not possess inherent immortality; immortality required external access (the tree of life) that God blocked. | E16 (Gen 3:22-24) | Gen 3:22-24 explicitly states God's concern was that man might "take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever." If man already had immortality, God's blocking of the tree would be purposeless. The action (blocking + expelling) is the textual evidence. Both sides must acknowledge the plain meaning: man lacked what the tree could provide. | NEW → N015 |
| N6 | The three NT immortality-positive words (G110 athanasia, G861 aphtharsia, G862 aphthartos) are never applied to the present human soul, spirit, or body. | E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9, E10, E11, E12 (survey of all occurrences) | This is a complete occurrence survey fact. Both sides must acknowledge that in the NT text, none of these words appears in a clause where the subject is a present human being in a present state. | NEW → N016 |
| N7 | The soul (nephesh in Ezk; psyche in Rev 16:3) can die; it is not described as indestructible. | E22 (Ezk 18:4,20); E24 (Rev 16:3) | Ezk 18:4 states nephesh is the grammatical subject of dying. Rev 16:3 states every living psyche died. Both sides must acknowledge the nephesh/psyche is the stated grammatical subject of the death predicate. | → Master N007 |
| N8 | God possesses the power to destroy both soul and body; the soul is not beyond divine destruction. | E23 (Mat 10:28) | Mat 10:28 explicitly states God "is able to destroy [apolesai] both soul and body in gehenna." The text provides no qualifier limiting "destroy" to something other than destruction. | → Master N008 |
| N9 | Humans must seek immortality because they do not presently possess it. | E9 (Rom 2:7) | A being seeking a thing does not currently possess it. Seeking implies present lack. This is the meaning of the seeking verb (zetousin, present active participle = active ongoing seeking). | → Master N012 |
| N10 | Eternal life is a gift from Christ, not an inherent human property; those without the Son do not have it. | E14 (1 John 5:11-12); E40 (John 10:28); E41 (John 3:36) | 1 John 5:12 states explicitly: "He that hath not the Son of God hath not life." Both sides must acknowledge the unqualified negative: life is absent from those who do not have the Son. | NEW → N017 |
| N11 | Death is described as the universal human appointment and the direct consequence of Adam's sin passing to all humans. | E15 (Heb 9:27); E20 (Rom 5:12) | Heb 9:27: "It is appointed unto men once to die" — universal, unqualified. Rom 5:12: "death passed upon all men" — universal scope stated explicitly. Both together mean no human naturally escapes death as an appointed reality. | NEW → N018 |
| N12 | Death ("the last enemy") is currently operational and active; its final destruction is a future eschatological event. | E34 (1 Cor 15:26); E26 (Isa 25:8 — "will swallow up death" = future); E29 (Hos 13:14 — "I will redeem them" = future) | 1 Cor 15:26 states death is "the last enemy that SHALL BE destroyed" (future). Isa 25:8 is "will swallow up" (future). Paul quotes both of these as fulfilled AT the resurrection in 1 Cor 15:54-55. The present state is that death is an unredeemed power; its defeat is eschatological. | NEW → N019 |

### 3. Inferences Table (4-Type Taxonomy)

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that humans do not possess an inherently immortal soul; the soul is mortal until God grants immortality at the resurrection. | I-A | E1 (God alone has athanasia — 1 Tim 6:16); E8 (3 NT occurrences of athanasia: all either God's possession or mortals' future reception); E3/E4 (mortal must put on immortality at resurrection — 1 Cor 15:53-54); E9 (humans seek immortality — Rom 2:7); E22 (nephesh can die — Ezk 18:4); E23 (God can destroy soul and body — Mat 10:28); N1 (God alone has immortality); N3 (immortality at resurrection); N7 (soul can die). | No single verse states "humans do not possess an inherently immortal soul." This is the systematic conclusion of E/N evidence from multiple passages and both testaments. All components are in E/N tables. Note: This systematizes the same evidence as IA003 in etc5-01 and is the same claim. | #5 (systematizing) | Master IA003 |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that the state of the dead is one of complete unawareness — no thought, no knowledge, no praise — until the resurrection. | I-A | E25 (Dan 12:2,13: sleep in dust, Daniel rests until end); prior study E13/Master E013 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4); prior E17/Master E017 (dead know not any thing — Ecc 9:5); prior E18-E19/Master E018-E019 (Ecc 9:6,10); prior E20-E021 (Job 14:12,21). N9 from prior study (death = sleep consistently). | No single verse states "the dead are unconscious." This is the systematic conclusion of the accumulated E/N pattern across both testaments. All components are E/N items. Note: Same as IA005 in etc5-01. | #5 (systematizing); #4a (Ecc 9:5 interprets sleep metaphor) | Master IA005 |
| I3 | The NT Greek vocabulary of immortality (athanasia, aphtharsia, aphthartos) is consistent evidence that humans are presently in a state of mortality/corruptibility and receive immortality/incorruption only at the resurrection. | I-A | N2 (vocabulary distribution: positive words → God and resurrection state; negative words → present human state); E1-E12 (complete occurrence survey); E33 (Luk 20:36: deathless state is post-resurrection only). | No single verse states "the vocabulary pattern demonstrates X." This is the systematic observation of all NT occurrences of the five immortality/mortality words, organized into a vocabulary-distribution pattern. All components are textual facts in the E/N tables. | #5 (systematizing vocabulary data into a theological conclusion) | NEW → IA009 |
| I4 | The tree of life narrative (Gen 2-3; Rev 2:7; Rev 22:2,14) consistently presents immortality as external, conditional, and divinely mediated — not as an inherent human property. | I-A | E16 (Gen 3:22-24: tree blocked); N15 (man lacked immortality the tree could provide); E17 (Rev 2:7: tree promised to overcomers); E18 (Rev 22:2,14: tree in new creation, access for those with right to it); Gen 2:9 (tree planted in Eden, accessible pre-fall). | No single verse states "immortality is not an inherent human property" as a comprehensive conclusion. This systematizes the entire tree of life narrative across Genesis and Revelation into a theological conclusion about the nature of immortality. All components are in E/N tables. | #5 (systematizing the narrative arc) | NEW → IA010 |
| I5 | The Bible teaches that eternal life is available exclusively through the Son; those who do not have the Son do not have life. | I-A | E14 (1 John 5:11-12: life is in the Son; having/not having the Son = having/not having life); E13 (John 5:26: life in himself is a divine attribute); E40 (John 10:28: "I give unto them eternal life"); E41 (John 3:36: not believing Son = not seeing life); E19 (Rom 6:23: eternal life is a gift through Christ); N10 (eternal life is a gift from Christ, not inherent). | No single verse states "eternal life is available exclusively through the Son" as a comprehensive doctrine. This systematizes John 5:26, 1 John 5:11-12, John 10:28, John 3:36, and Rom 6:23 into a Christocentric-exclusivity claim. All components are E/N items. | #5 (systematizing) | NEW → IA011 |
| I6 | The Bible teaches a conscious intermediate state for the righteous — a state of being "with Christ" or "with the Lord" between death and resurrection. | I-B | FOR: E38 (absent from body = present with Lord — 2 Cor 5:8/Master E038); E39 (depart = be with Christ — Phil 1:23/Master E039); Master E050 (today with me in paradise — Luk 23:43); Master E051 (souls under altar cry out — Rev 6:9-11); Master E052 (spirits of just men made perfect — Heb 12:23). AGAINST: Master E020 (man lies down, rises not — Job 14:12); Master E017 (dead know not any thing — Ecc 9:5); Master E013 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4); Master E014 (dead do not praise — Psa 115:17); N3 (immortality at resurrection); Master N009 (death = sleep). | No verse explicitly states "there is a conscious intermediate state." Phil 1:23 and 2 Cor 5:8 are interpreted as implying it; state-of-the-dead passages are interpreted as limited in scope. Both sets of E/N items are genuine. | #2 (choosing between possible readings); #5 (systematizing into a doctrine) | Master IB001 |
| I7 | The "dead know not any thing" language in Ecclesiastes is limited to earthly affairs "under the sun" and does not address the state of the spirit in God's presence. | I-B | FOR qualifier: Master E012 (spirit returns to God — Ecc 12:7); Master E018 (dead have no more portion in things done "under the sun" — Ecc 9:6); Master E052 (spirits of just men made perfect); E38/Master E039 (depart to be with Christ). AGAINST: Master E017 (Ecc 9:5: unqualified in v.5); Master E013 (Psa 146:4: no qualifier); Master E014-E016, E022 (multiple independent passages with no qualifier). | Requires importing the "under the sun" framework from Ecclesiastes's literary structure into v.5, which does not contain it. Resolved in prior study. | #3 (applying literary framework to qualify an absolute statement); #2 | Master IB002 |
| I8 | "Spirit returns to God" in Ecc 12:7 means a conscious personal entity (the soul of the person) goes to God in a state of awareness at death. | I-B | FOR: Master E012 (Ecc 12:7); Master E048, E049 (spirit commended to God — Luk 23:46; Acts 7:59); Master E039 (depart to be with Christ — Phil 1:23); Master E052 (spirits of just men made perfect). AGAINST: Master E010-E011 (man and beast share ruach; all go to dust — Ecc 3:19-20); Master N011 (ruach is God's animating breath); Master E013 (thoughts perish that very day — simultaneous with ruach departure). | "Returns to God" does not specify conscious vs. unconscious state. Resolved in prior study. | #2 (two possible meanings); #4b (unverified cross-reference Ecc 12:7 → Phil 1:23) | Master IB005 |
| I9 | Human beings possess an immortal soul that survives death and continues in conscious existence, separate from the body. | I-D | 1 Tim 6:16: God ALONE (monos) has immortality — E1/Master E029, N1/N005. 1 Cor 15:53: mortals MUST PUT ON immortality at resurrection — E3/Master E031, N3/N006. Ezk 18:4: the soul that sins SHALL DIE — E22/Master E024, N7/N007. Mat 10:28: God CAN DESTROY both soul and body — E23/Master E026, N8/N008. | Conflicts with E1/N1 (God alone has immortality), E3/N3 (immortality at resurrection), E22/N7 (soul can die), E23/N8 (God can destroy the soul). Requires redefining "only" (monos) in 1 Tim 6:16 as comparative rather than exclusive; limiting "must put on" to the body only; spiritualizing "die" in Ezk 18:4 to mean only spiritual separation. All these rereadings require overriding plain lexical values of E statements. | #1 (adding "inherent/self-existent immortality" not stated); #2 (qualified readings of monos, athanasia, tamut); #3 (Platonic immortality framework); overrides E1/E029, N1/N005, E3/E031, N3/N006, E22/E024, E23/E026, N7/N007, N8/N008 | Master ID001 |
| I10 | The phrase "God alone has immortality" (1 Tim 6:16) describes God's pre-eminence in immortality, not an exclusive divine possession; redeemed souls participate in a derived immortality. | I-D | The text states: "who only [monos] hath immortality [athanasian]" (E1/Master E029). The same letter (1 Tim 6:12,19) instructs Timothy to "lay hold on eternal life" — implying it is not yet grasped. Rom 2:7 (E9/Master E030): humans seek immortality. 1 Cor 15:53-54 (E3/E4): mortals must put on immortality at a future event. | The claim requires monos (alone/only) to mean "pre-eminently" or "uniquely" rather than "exclusively." Monos is used twice in 1 Tim 6:15-16 — once for God as "only Potentate" and once for immortality. The same word in adjacent verses cannot mean "pre-eminent" in v.16 but "exclusive" in v.15 without textual justification. The "seeking" of immortality (Rom 2:7) and the future "putting on" (1 Cor 15:53) both confirm that no human presently possesses it. | #2 (choosing a qualified reading of monos against its plain meaning); overrides E1/E029, E3/E031, E9/E030, N1/N005, N3/N006, N9/N012 | NEW → ID003 |
| I11 | The language of "absent from the body, present with the Lord" (2 Cor 5:8) and "depart and be with Christ" (Phil 1:23) describes an instantaneous subjective experience from the dead person's perspective (who experiences no interval in unconscious sleep), not an objectively continuous intermediate conscious state. | I-C | 2 Cor 5:8 (Master E038); Phil 1:23 (Master E039) — these texts say what they say. | Adds the concept of "subjective time from the dead person's perspective" — a philosophical concept not found in any E/N item. Not derived from Scripture; applied to resolve the tension between E38/E39 and the state-of-the-dead texts. Does not override any E/N statement. | #3 (philosophical framework); #1 (adding concept not in text) | Master IC001 |
| I12 | The "soul that sins shall die" (Ezk 18:4) refers only to physical death of the body, not the death of any surviving soul. | I-D | Ezk 18:4: nephesh is the grammatical subject of dying (E22/Master E024, N7/N007). Rev 16:3: every living psyche died (E24/Master E028). Lev 21:11, Num 6:6: nephesh met = corpse (Master E043). Mat 10:28: God can destroy the soul (E23/Master E026). | Requires the nephesh that is said to die to be understood as "only the body" despite nephesh being the grammatical subject of the death predicate. Overrides E22/E024 by restricting "death" to a scope the text does not specify. Also conflicts with E24/E028 (every living psyche died) and Master E043 (nephesh met = dead soul IS the corpse). | #1 (adding restriction "only physical" not in text); #2 (qualified reading of tamut); overrides E22/E024, E24/E028, Master E043, N7/N007 | Master ID002 |

### I-B Resolution Sections

---

#### I-B Resolution: I6 — Conscious intermediate state for the righteous

*(This I-B was established in etc5-01 as IB001/Master IB001 and resolved as Unresolved. This study adds no new E/N items on either side of this specific claim; the resolution from etc5-01 stands. The new evidence in this study (the vocabulary distribution showing mortals as presently thnetos; immortality at resurrection only; life in the Son) adds indirect weight to the AGAINST side but does not introduce a new plain statement on the FOR side. The resolution remains Unresolved within this study.)*

**Step 1 — Tension (summary from prior study):**
- FOR: Master E038 (2 Cor 5:8); Master E039 (Phil 1:23); Master E050 (Luk 23:43); Master E051 (Rev 6:9-11); Master E052 (Heb 12:23)
- AGAINST: Master E020 (Job 14:12); Master E017 (Ecc 9:5); Master E013 (Psa 146:4); Master N009 (death = sleep); N3/Master N006 (immortality at resurrection)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment (additions from this study):**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E33 (Luk 20:36: "cannot die any more" is post-resurrection) | Plain | Jesus explicitly states the deathless condition is for "they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead" — a future condition |
| N3 (immortality at resurrection, not at death) | — | Necessary implication of E3/E4/E7/E33 together |
| E25 (Dan 12:13: Daniel told to "rest" until "end of the days") | Plain | Prophetic address to Daniel personally; future-oriented awakening; sleep metaphor applied specifically; no intermediate conscious state indicated |

**Step 3 — Weight (additional consideration from this study):**

E33 (Luk 20:36) is a plain statement by Jesus that the deathless state belongs to "the children of the resurrection" — those who have obtained the resurrection. This adds weight to the AGAINST side: if "cannot die any more" is post-resurrection, then pre-resurrection, the dead can die (or remain in death). The deathless state does not appear in Jesus's own teaching as a present intermediate-state characteristic.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**

The plain statement by Jesus that the deathless/angel-equal condition belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection (E33) is within a didactic, non-apocalyptic discourse. It should be permitted to interpret the more ambiguous passages (Phil 1:23) about the post-death condition. If deathlessness belongs only to the resurrected state, then "depart and be with Christ" (Phil 1:23) does not automatically indicate an immortal-soul intermediate state.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Unresolved (confirmed, with additional weight against the conscious intermediate state from new material)**

E39 (Phil 1:23) and Master E050 (Luk 23:43) remain plain items on the FOR side. The new evidence from this study (E33, N3) adds weight but does not eliminate the plain items on the FOR side. The I-B remains Unresolved; the question of the intermediate state requires dedicated study in subsequent etc5 studies.

#### I-B Resolution: I7 — "Dead know not any thing" limited to earthly perspective

*(This I-B was established in etc5-01 as IB002/Master IB002 and resolved as Moderate (weight against the qualifier). No new E/N items in this study change the assessment. The resolution from etc5-01 stands: Moderate, weight AGAINST the qualifier.)*

---

#### I-B Resolution: I8 — "Spirit returns to God" = conscious person going to God

*(This I-B was established in etc5-01 as IB005/Master IB005 and resolved as Moderate (weight toward "animating life-force returning to source"). No new E/N items in this study change the assessment. The resolution from etc5-01 stands: Moderate, weight toward the conditionalist reading.)*

### 4. Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements:**

- E1-E41 checked against verse texts. Each E-statement directly quotes or closely paraphrases the actual verse text.
- E2 (1 Tim 1:17: God is "immortal" / aphthartos): This is what the text says — a direct application of G862 to God. Legitimate E-statement.
- E8 (occurrence survey of G110): This is a complete textual survey of all 3 NT occurrences of athanasia. Observable fact. Legitimate E-statement.
- E10 (all 6 thnetos occurrences): Complete textual survey. Observable fact. Legitimate E-statement.
- E13 (John 5:26: life in himself = divine attribute): The text explicitly states this of the Father and Son; the absence of such a statement for humans is an observable textual gap, not an inference. Legitimate E-statement.
- E33 (Luk 20:36: deathless state is post-resurrection): The text explicitly connects "neither can they die any more" with "they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection." The temporal scope is set by the text itself. Legitimate E-statement.
- E41 (John 3:36): Direct quote of verse text. Legitimate E-statement.
- No E-items appear to be positional inferences misclassified as E-tier. All are textual observations both sides must acknowledge.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications:**

- N2 (vocabulary distribution): Does this require interpretation? The claim is a complete occurrence survey — G110/G861/G862 never applied to present human state; G2349/G5349 always applied to present human state. This is an observable count, not an interpretation. Both sides must acknowledge the vocabulary distribution. PASSES all three tests.
- N3 (immortality at resurrection): Is there any alternative timing given in 1 Cor 15:52-54? The "at the last trump" specification in v.52 makes the timing explicit. The deathless state in Luk 20:36 is tied to "obtaining the resurrection." PASSES.
- N4 (life in himself = divine attribute): Does this require interpretation? John 5:26 says the Father has it; the Son has it (given). It does NOT say humans have it. Both sides must acknowledge what the text says and what it does not say. PASSES.
- N5 (tree of life: man lacked immortality): Does an ECT proponent necessarily agree? The question is whether "lest he eat and live for ever" requires the implication that he did not yet live forever. If man already had immortality, God's action is purposeless. This follows directly from the text without adding concepts. PASSES.
- N6 (three positive words never applied to present human state): This is a complete occurrence survey result. No interpretation required. PASSES.
- N10 (life is a gift, not inherent; not having Son = not having life): 1 John 5:12 is the explicit statement. The universal negative "hath not the Son hath not life" is unqualified. PASSES.
- N11 (death universal; universal appointment): Heb 9:27 ("appointed unto men once to die") is unqualified. Rom 5:12 ("death passed upon all men") is unqualified. PASSES.
- N12 (death is currently active; destruction is future): 1 Cor 15:26 says death SHALL BE destroyed (future). Paul quotes Isa 25:8 and Hos 13:14 as fulfilled AT the resurrection in vv.54-55. The future orientation is in the text itself. PASSES.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test):**

- I1 (no inherently immortal soul): All components in E/N tables. I-A confirmed (same as Master IA003).
- I2 (unconscious dead): All components in E/N tables. I-A confirmed (same as Master IA005).
- I3 (vocabulary pattern): All components are textual survey facts in E/N tables. Systematizes them into a theological conclusion. I-A confirmed.
- I4 (tree of life = external immortality): All components in E/N tables (Gen 2:9/3:22-24, Rev 2:7, Rev 22:2,14). Systematizes the narrative arc. I-A confirmed.
- I5 (eternal life exclusively through Son): All components in E/N tables (John 5:26, 1 John 5:11-12, John 10:28, John 3:36, Rom 6:23). Systematizes multiple explicit statements. I-A confirmed.
- I6 (conscious intermediate state): E/N items on both sides. I-B confirmed (same as Master IB001).
- I7 ("under the sun" qualifier): Same as Master IB002. I-B confirmed.
- I8 (spirit returns = conscious person): Same as Master IB005. I-B confirmed.
- I9 (immortal soul): Conflicts with E1/N1, E3/N3, E22/N7, E23/N8. I-D confirmed (same as Master ID001).
- I10 (monos = pre-eminent only): Requires monos to mean something other than its plain exclusive meaning. Conflicts with E1/N1, E3, E9, N3, N9. I-D confirmed.
- I11 (subjective time / instantaneous consciousness): The "subjective time" concept is not in any E/N table. Does not override any E/N statement. I-C confirmed (same as Master IC001).
- I12 ("soul dies" = only physical): Conflicts with E22/N7, E24, Master E043. I-D confirmed (same as Master ID002).

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test):**

- I9: Requires E1's "only" to mean "pre-eminently"; E3's "must put on" to be limited to body only; E22's "die" to mean "spiritual separation." All require lexical override. I-D confirmed.
- I10: Requires monos (alone/only) to mean "pre-eminently" rather than "exclusively." Requires overriding the plain exclusive meaning. I-D confirmed.
- I12: Requires E22's "the soul that sins shall die" (nephesh is subject) to mean "the body of the person shall die." Requires overriding the stated grammatical subject. I-D confirmed.

**Step E: Consistency checks:**

- I-A items (I1, I2, I3, I4, I5): Each requires only criterion #5 (systematizing). None require #1, #2, or #3 independently. Confirmed I-A.
- I-B items (I6, I7, I8): Each has E/N on both sides. Confirmed I-B.
- I-C (I11): Does not override any E/N statement; the subjective-time concept is external to the text. Confirmed I-C.
- I-D (I9, I10, I12): Each overrides at least one E/N statement. Confirmed I-D.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections:**

- I6 Resolution uses E33 (Luk 20:36: deathless state is post-resurrection) to add weight against the conscious intermediate state. Connection: E33 is in the same Lukan discourse as the resurrection argument; it is a direct contextual statement about when deathlessness begins. This is a #4a connection (same author, contextual connection).
- I-B resolutions I7 and I8 are carried forward from etc5-01; their SIS documentation stands.

### 7. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**

- God alone currently possesses immortality (athanasia, G110) as an inherent attribute — 1 Tim 6:16 uses the exclusive monos (alone/only). (E1/Master E029, N1/N005)
- God is described as "immortal" (aphthartos, G862) in the NT doxologies — 1 Tim 1:17; this is the only entity to whom the immortality-positive vocabulary applies in the present tense. (E2/E061)
- The Son possesses "life in himself" (zoe en heauto) as a divine property given from the Father; this attribute is not stated of any human. (E13/E067, N4/N014)
- The three NT words for immortality/incorruption (G110 athanasia, G861 aphtharsia, G862 aphthartos) are never applied to any present human being in any NT text. (N2/N013, N6/N016)
- Human beings are described as mortal (thnetos, G2349) and corruptible (phthartos, G5349) in the present age, in all NT occurrences of these words. (E10/Master E055)
- Man in the fallen state did not possess inherent immortality; God actively blocked access to the tree of life to prevent man from living forever. (E16/Master E003, N5/N015)
- The body/person undergoes transformation at the resurrection: corruptible puts on incorruption; mortal puts on immortality. The timing is specified as "at the last trump." (E3, E4, E7/Master E031-E032, E064; N3/N006)
- The deathless state ("cannot die any more") is explicitly a post-resurrection state in Jesus's own teaching (Luk 20:35-36). (E33/E082)
- The soul (nephesh) can die; it is stated as the grammatical subject of dying in Ezekiel 18:4. (E22/Master E024, N7/N007)
- God is able to destroy both soul and body in gehenna. (E23/Master E026, N8/N008)
- Humans seek immortality (Rom 2:7) and do not currently possess it. (E9/Master E030, N9/N012)
- Eternal life is in the Son; those who do not have the Son do not have life (1 John 5:11-12). (E14/E068, N10/N017)
- Death is the universal human appointment and the consequence of Adam's sin passing to all (Heb 9:27; Rom 5:12). (E15/E069, E20/E073, N11/N018)
- Death is currently an active enemy; its final destruction is an eschatological event at the resurrection (1 Cor 15:26; Isa 25:8). (E34/E083, E26/E075, N12/N019)
- Christ abolished death and brought immortality to light through the gospel (2 Tim 1:10). (E32/E081)
- The incorruptible inheritance is reserved in heaven and "ready to be revealed in the last time" — not yet received. (E36/E085)
- All humans are described as in bondage to the fear of death throughout their lifetimes (Heb 2:14-15). (E37/E086)
- The OT consistently anticipates a future resurrection: the dead sleep in the dust (Dan 12:2); God will ransom from the grave (Hos 13:14); God's dead will arise (Isa 26:19); death will be swallowed up in victory (Isa 25:8). All these are future-tense promises. (E25-E29/E082-E078)
- The wages of sin is death; the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ — death is the earned result, life is the given gift. (E19/E072)

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**

- The Bible explicitly states that humans possess an inherently immortal soul. No such statement exists; 1 Tim 6:16 explicitly denies it for any creature with the unqualified word monos (alone/only). (I9/Master ID001 is I-D)
- The Bible states that monos in 1 Tim 6:16 means "pre-eminently" rather than "exclusively." The text provides no qualifier, and the same word used in the adjacent verse for God as "only Potentate" is exclusive. (I10/ID003 is I-D)
- The Bible explicitly states that any human soul is currently deathless or cannot die. Multiple texts state the opposite: the soul can die (Ezk 18:4); God can destroy the soul (Mat 10:28); every living soul died (Rev 16:3). (I12/Master ID002 is I-D)
- The Bible explicitly states there is a conscious intermediate state between death and resurrection. The texts cited for this (Phil 1:23; 2 Cor 5:8; Luk 23:43) are interpreted as implying it; the plain state-of-the-dead passages (Ecc 9:5; Psa 146:4; Job 14:12) describe unconsciousness. This remains I-B Unresolved. (I6/Master IB001)
- The immortality-positive words (athanasia, aphtharsia, aphthartos) describe the present human soul. In every NT occurrence these words describe either God's nature or the resurrection state.
- Receiving eternal life through faith means the soul has already put on immortality. 1 Cor 15:53 specifies the "putting on" as a future event at the resurrection; receiving eternal life as a covenantal status (1 John 5:12) is not equivalent to the body-transformation of 1 Cor 15.
- The "death shall not see corruption" promise (Psa 16:10 = Acts 2:27,31) applies to all believers as a present state. Acts 2 explicitly applies this to Jesus's resurrection — Christ's body did not see corruption because he was raised. The broader application to believers is at their own resurrection.
- The OT consistently describes dead humans as conscious in any positive intermediate state. Dan 12:13 addresses Daniel personally with "thou shalt rest... stand in thy lot at the end of the days" — sleep until the final resurrection, not intermediate conscious existence.
