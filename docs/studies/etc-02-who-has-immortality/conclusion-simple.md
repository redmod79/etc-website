# Who Has Immortality? — Plain-Language Summary

## What This Study Is About

Does the human soul naturally live forever, or is immortality something God gives? This study looked at every New Testament occurrence of the words translated "immortality," "incorruption," "mortal," and "corruption," along with all related biblical passages on eternal life, mortality, and life as a gift. The findings are summarized below.

## What the Bible Directly Says

### 1. God Alone Has Immortality

The clearest statement in the New Testament on this subject is 1 Timothy 6:16, which says God is the one "who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto." The word translated "only" (Greek *monos*) is the same word used in 1 Timothy 1:17 ("the only wise God") and John 17:3 ("the only true God"). It marks exclusivity with no qualification. The verse does not say God has a *special kind* of immortality — it says God *only* has it.

Consistent with this, Romans 1:23 places God and man on opposite sides of a direct contrast: God is "uncorruptible"; man is "corruptible." These are not subtle distinctions — they describe two fundamentally different kinds of existence.

### 2. Humans Are Mortal, Not Immortal

The New Testament repeatedly describes the human body and human flesh as "mortal" (*thnetos*). Paul writes of "your mortal body" (Rom 6:12), "your mortal bodies" (Rom 8:11), "our mortal flesh" (2 Cor 4:11), and "mortality" being swallowed up by life (2 Cor 5:4). Job 4:17–20 asks: "Shall mortal man be more just than God? ...Man dwells in houses of clay...they are destroyed and perish forever."

No New Testament verse ever calls the human soul immortal, incorruptible, or undying. The phrase "immortal soul" does not appear anywhere in Scripture. The closest any verse comes to the subject is Matthew 10:28 — but that verse says the *opposite*: God is able to "destroy both soul and body in hell." And Ezekiel 18:4 states plainly, "the soul that sinneth, it shall die."

### 3. Immortality Is Acquired at the Resurrection — Not Before

Mortals do not currently possess immortality. They *put it on* at the resurrection. Paul writes:

> "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory." (1 Cor 15:53–54)

The verb "put on" describes receiving something one does not already have — the same way Paul uses it in "put on the Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom 13:14) or "put on the whole armour of God" (Eph 6:11). The transition from mortality to immortality is a future divine act, not a present human condition.

Jesus confirms the timing in Luke 20:36: those counted worthy of the resurrection "can die no more" — implying that before the resurrection, they *could* die. The transformation happens at the last day, not at death.

### 4. Eternal Life Is a Gift, Not an Inheritance

Across the entire Bible, eternal life is consistently described as something given, promised, sought, or received — never as something humans already possess by nature:

- A gift: "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." (Rom 6:23)
- Something to seek: "To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life." (Rom 2:7)
- A promise: "In hope of eternal life, which God...promised before the world began." (Tit 1:2); "This is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life." (1 John 2:25)
- Brought to light by Christ: "Our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel." (2 Tim 1:10)

### 5. Eternal Life Is Conditional on Christ

Multiple authors — Jesus, John, Paul — state clearly that life is located *in Christ* and is not possessed apart from him:

> "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life." (1 John 5:11–12)

> "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you." (John 6:53)

> "He that believeth not the Son shall not see life." (John 3:36)

> "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life." (John 5:40)

The conditionality is consistent: believe and have life; reject Christ and not have life.

### 6. The Alternative to Eternal Life Is Death and Perishing

When the New Testament describes what happens to those who do not receive eternal life, the language is consistently that of death, perishing, and destruction — not ongoing conscious existence:

- "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." (John 3:16)
- "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life." (Rom 6:23)
- "He that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting." (Gal 6:8)
- "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord." (2 Thess 1:9)
- The wicked "shall utterly perish in their own corruption." (2 Pet 2:12)
- "Man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish." (Ps 49:12, 20)

In each of these passages, the alternative to life is expressed as perishing, death, destruction, or corruption — not as continued existence in torment.

## What the Bible Does Not Say

**The Bible never says humans have an immortal soul.** The phrase does not appear. No verse attributes immortality or incorruption to the human soul as a present, inherent possession. The attempt to read an immortal soul into Scripture requires treating the word "only" in 1 Timothy 6:16 as if it did not mean "only," treating "mortal" as applying only to the body while an implied immortal soul is exempt (a distinction the texts never make), and treating "die" and "destroy" in passages about the soul as meaning something other than what those words normally mean.

**The Bible never presents immortality as something humans naturally possess and merely need to have "activated" or "revealed."** Immortality is not described as a latent human attribute. It is described as belonging to God, revealed through Christ, and given to believers at the resurrection.

**Luke 20:38 ("all live unto him") does not teach that the dead are currently conscious.** In context, Jesus is making an argument *for the resurrection*: God calls himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — and since God is not "a God of the dead, but of the living," the patriarchs will be raised. The statement is the theological ground for their future resurrection, not a description of their present conscious state.

## Summary of Findings

The evidence from this study points consistently in one direction:

1. God alone has immortality as a present possession (1 Tim 6:16).
2. Man is mortal and corruptible by nature (Rom 1:23; 1 Cor 15:42–54).
3. Death entered the world through Adam's sin; all in Adam die (1 Cor 15:21–22; Rom 5:12).
4. Man was barred from the tree of life specifically to prevent living forever (Gen 3:22–24).
5. Immortality is put on at the resurrection — it is a future acquisition, not a present possession (1 Cor 15:53–54).
6. Eternal life is a gift located in Christ; those without Christ are said to "have not life" (1 John 5:12).
7. The stated alternative to eternal life is perishing, death, corruption, and destruction.
8. No passage of Scripture attributes immortality to the human soul.

The conditionalist reading — that humans are mortal, immortality is God's gift through Christ, and those without Christ ultimately perish rather than endure eternal conscious torment — rests on plain statements from Scripture read at face value, across multiple authors, genres, and Testaments. The view that humans possess an inherently immortal soul requires importing a distinction (between "self-existent" and "derived" immortality) that the texts themselves never make, and requires qualifying or setting aside what 1 Timothy 6:16, 1 John 5:12, John 6:53, and Romans 6:23 plainly state.
