## Scope of Investigation

### Central Question
Who possesses immortality according to Scripture? Is the human soul inherently immortal, or is immortality a conditional divine gift? This study focuses on the three Greek word families for immortality/mortality and what Scripture says about who has, can receive, or lacks immortality.

### Prior Study Context (etc-01)
The anthropology study established:
- N002: Man does not inherently possess immortality (based on E024, E025, E026)
- N005: The nephesh (soul) is mortal -- it can die and be destroyed (based on E016, E028)
- E024: God only (monos) has immortality (athanasia) -- 1 Tim 6:16
- E025: Those who seek immortality (aphtharsia) receive eternal life -- Rom 2:7
- E026: This mortal must put on immortality (athanasia) at resurrection -- 1 Cor 15:53-54
- E027: Christ brought life and immortality (aphtharsia) to light through the gospel -- 2 Tim 1:10
- I001 (I-D): The claim that humans possess an inherently immortal soul requires overriding E024, E016, E028, and E011/E019

This study (etc-02) goes deeper into the word studies for the three key terms and examines all their occurrences, the broader context of passages where they appear, and whether any Scripture attributes immortality to human beings.

### Key Passages to Examine (from tool output)

#### A. The Immortality Word-Study Passages (all occurrences of G110, G861, G2349, G862)

1. **1 Corinthians 15:42-54** -- The resurrection chapter; densest concentration of immortality vocabulary. Contains G110 (athanasia), G861 (aphtharsia), G2349 (thnetos), G862 (aphthartos), G5356 (phthora). Examine the full argument about what "puts on" immortality and when.

2. **1 Timothy 6:14-16** -- God "who only hath immortality" (athanasia, G110). Examine the force of monos ("only") and what it excludes.

3. **Romans 2:7** -- "To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality [aphtharsia, G861], eternal life." Examine: if immortality is inherent, why must it be sought?

4. **2 Timothy 1:10** -- Christ "brought life and immortality [aphtharsia, G861] to light through the gospel." Examine: what does "brought to light" mean? Was immortality hidden or non-existent before the gospel?

5. **Romans 6:12** -- "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal [thnetos, G2349] body." The body is called mortal.

6. **Romans 8:11** -- "He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal [thnetos, G2349] bodies." Future quickening of mortal bodies.

7. **2 Corinthians 4:11** -- "The life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal [thnetos, G2349] flesh."

8. **2 Corinthians 5:4** -- "That mortality [thnetos, G2349] might be swallowed up of life." The only verse translating thnetos as "mortality."

9. **1 Timothy 1:17** -- "Now unto the King eternal, immortal [aphthartos, G862], invisible, the only wise God." God is called aphthartos.

10. **Romans 1:23** -- "Changed the glory of the uncorruptible [aphthartos, G862] God into an image made like to corruptible man." Contrast: God is incorruptible; man is corruptible.

11. **1 Peter 1:4** -- "An inheritance incorruptible [aphthartos, G862], and undefiled."

12. **1 Peter 1:23** -- "Born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible [aphthartos, G862]."

### Research Questions to Investigate

1. **Who possesses athanasia (G110)?** Examine all 3 occurrences. Does any verse attribute athanasia to humans inherently? Or only to God (1 Tim 6:16) and as a future transformation at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54)?

2. **What is the nature of aphtharsia (G861)?** Examine all 8 occurrences. Is it something humans have, or something they must seek (Rom 2:7), that Christ revealed (2 Tim 1:10), and that is received at resurrection (1 Cor 15:42-54)?

3. **What does thnetos (G2349) reveal about human nature?** Examine all 6 occurrences. When Paul calls the human body/flesh "mortal" (thnetos), what does this imply about the current state of human beings?

4. **Is eternal life inherent or gifted?** Examine the "life" passages from John's Gospel and Romans. Is eternal life something humans already possess or something conditionally given by God?

5. **What is the relationship between mortality and the resurrection?** 1 Cor 15 is the key chapter. What happens at resurrection to mortal/corruptible bodies? What does "putting on" immortality mean?

6. **Does any passage attribute immortality to the human soul?** Search for any verse that says the soul (nephesh/psyche) is immortal, undying, or indestructible. Compare with E016 (soul dies) and E028 (soul destroyed).

7. **What is the significance of the tree of life in Gen 3:22-24?** Why was man barred from it? What does this imply about human mortality?

8. **How do the aphthartos (G862) passages contribute?** When God is called "incorruptible" (Rom 1:23; 1 Tim 1:17), what does the contrast with corruptible humanity reveal?

9. **What does "corruption" (phthora, G5356) teach about human nature?** Examine the corruption/incorruption contrast in 1 Cor 15, Rom 8, Gal 6, 2 Pet.

10. **Luke 20:36 -- Does equality with angels entail immortality?** Jesus says resurrected saints "neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels." Does this imply they COULD die before resurrection?

### Investigative Methodology

```
INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by ECT proponents, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by conditionalists, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says. Do not use editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," "honestly acknowledge," or "non-intuitive reading." Simply state what each passage says and what each side infers from it.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- Never use language like "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.
```

### Output Files

Produce the following files in D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-02-who-has-immortality/:

1. **01-topics.md** -- Nave's topics and verse lists relevant to immortality
2. **02-verses.md** -- All key verses with full text and initial observations
3. **03-analysis.md** -- Detailed passage analysis, contextual examination, cross-references

### Critical Reminders

- Run BOTH --hybrid-ot AND --hybrid-nt for every key verse
- Read and update D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-master-evidence.md with all new items
- Use the etc-series-methodology.md classification system (E > N > I-A > I-B > I-C > I-D)
- Apply Tree 3 for every E-item given a positional classification
- Apply the stricter N-tier test for every N-item
- Do NOT reference etc-01-what-is-man (deleted); the prior study is etc-01-what-is-man
- Cross-reference items already in the master evidence file (E024-E027, N002, N005, etc.)
- For passages examined in depth in later etc studies, briefly state what the text says and note the cross-reference
