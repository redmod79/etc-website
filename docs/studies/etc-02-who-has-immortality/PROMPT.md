| G2227 | ζωοποιέω (zōopoiéō) | verb | "quicken" (6x) | To vivify/make alive; resurrection life |

#### Hebrew OT Terms

| Strong's | Word | POS | KJV Translations | Relevance |

**Note:** There is no single Hebrew word equivalent to the Greek athanasia. The OT approaches the concept through contrast (death vs. everlasting life), through the tree of life narrative (Gen 2-3), and through promises of future resurrection and everlasting life (Dan 12:2-3).

### Related Existing Studies

| Study | Question | Relevance |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| etc5-01-what-is-man | What is man according to the Bible -- body, soul, spirit? Is the soul inherently immortal? | Directly foundational: established that God alone has immortality (1 Tim 6:16); mortals must put on immortality at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53); the soul can die (Ezk 18:4); humans seek immortality (Rom 2:7). Explicit statements E29-E32, E54-E55 and Necessary Implications N5, N6, N12 are all directly relevant. |

#### Key Findings from etc5-01-what-is-man CONCLUSION.md

The previous study in this series (etc5-01-what-is-man) established the following as explicit statements (E tier) or necessary implications (N tier) that this study builds on directly:

- **E29/N5**: God alone (monos) possesses immortality (athanasia) as a present attribute (1 Tim 6:16). No creature currently possesses it as an inherent attribute.
- **E30/N12**: Humans "seek" immortality (aphtharsia, Rom 2:7), which implies they do not currently possess it.
- **E31/E32/N6**: "This mortal must put on immortality" (1 Cor 15:53-54) -- a future event at the resurrection, not at death or at birth.
- **E54**: G110 (athanasia, immortality) appears only 3 times in the NT: 1 Tim 6:16 (God alone has it); 1 Cor 15:53 (mortals must put it on); 1 Cor 15:54 (when mortal puts it on).
- **E55**: G2349 (thnetos, mortal) describes the present human body in all 6 NT occurrences.
- **E24/N7**: "The soul that sinneth, it shall die" (Ezk 18:4,20) -- the nephesh can die; it is not indestructible.
- **N10**: The present natural body is mortal; the resurrection body is raised incorruptible and immortal.

This study (etc5-02) goes deeper on these findings, investigating the full word families, all passages bearing on immortality and corruptibility, and the mechanism of receiving immortality.

### Focus Areas

The following focus areas are derived from what the tools discovered -- not from prior assumptions:

1. **The complete NT immortality word family**: The three Greek terms (G110 athanasia, G861 aphtharsia, G862 aphthartos) and their paired antonyms (G2349 thnetos, G5349 phthartos) across all 18+ occurrences. Nave's notes zero instances apply to humans as presently immortal.

2. **The tree of life narrative**: Gen 2:9; 3:22,24 -- God barred man from the tree "lest he... live for ever" (wachay le-olam); this is direct textual evidence that man did not inherently possess immortality. The eschatological restoration of the tree in Rev 2:7; 22:2,14.

3. **1 Timothy 6:16**: The central text -- God "only" (monos) has immortality (athanasia). The force of monos (alone/only) in the Greek.

4. **1 Corinthians 15**: The central resurrection chapter -- the sequence from sown in corruption/raised in incorruption (vv.42-44), the Adam/Christ contrast (vv.45-49), and the explicit "mortal must put on immortality" at the last trumpet (vv.50-54).

5. **The soul's mortality**: Ezk 18:4,20 (nephesh dies); Mat 10:28 (God can destroy psyche and body); Rev 16:3 (every living psyche died). Does the Hebrew/Greek text support the claim that the soul is an indestructible entity?

6. **When and mechanism of acquisition**: Rom 2:7 (seeking); 2 Tim 1:10 (Christ brought immortality to light); 1 Cor 15:53-54 (at the resurrection); 1 Th 4:13-18 (resurrection of the dead in Christ). The sequence: death -> sleep -> resurrection -> putting on immortality.

7. **Divine exclusivity of inherent life**: John 5:26 ("life in himself" is a divine attribute given from Father to Son); 1 John 5:11-12 (life is in the Son; no Son = no life).

8. **OT anticipation without the Greek vocabulary**: Dan 12:2-3 (everlasting life vs. everlasting contempt); Psa 49:7-9,14-15 (no man can ransom his brother from the grave -- but God can redeem); Isa 25:8 ("he will swallow up death in victory"); Isa 26:19 ("Thy dead men shall live"); the tree of life.

9. **The inheritance pattern in 1 Peter 1:3-5**: Inheritance described as "incorruptible" (aphthartos), reserved in heaven -- not yet received, but "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
