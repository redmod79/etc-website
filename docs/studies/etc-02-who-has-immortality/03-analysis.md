# Verse Analysis: Who Has Immortality?

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### A. The Immortality Word-Study Passages

---

### 1 Timothy 6:14-16 -- God "Who Only Hath Immortality"

**Context:** Paul's charge to Timothy in a Pastoral Epistle. The passage is a doxology embedded in practical instruction. Paul tells Timothy to keep the commandment "until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ" (v.14), then describes the God who will bring about that appearing: "the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto" (vv.15-16).

**Direct statement:** God alone (monos) possesses (echon, present active participle) athanasia. The word monos is unqualified -- no exception clause follows. The present participle echon indicates current, ongoing possession.

**Key observations:**
- The Greek monos ("only, alone") is the same word used in John 17:3 ("the only true God") and 1 Tim 1:17 ("the only wise God"). In each case it marks exclusivity.
- The context frames this within a passage about "the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ" (v.14) and the instruction to "lay hold on eternal life" (v.12, v.19). The surrounding verses treat eternal life as something to be grasped (epilambanomai), not something already possessed.
- Paul does not say "God has a special type of immortality." He says God "only" has immortality. The text does not distinguish between types.

**Cross-references:**
- 1 Tim 1:17 (same author, same book): God is called "immortal" (aphthartos) -- the adjective form of the incorruption word family. Both 1:17 and 6:16 are Pauline doxologies in the same letter, using immortality/incorruptibility vocabulary of God.
- Rom 1:23 (same author): God is "uncorruptible" (aphthartos); man is "corruptible" (phthartos). Paul establishes a direct God/man contrast on the corruption/incorruption axis.
- 1 Cor 15:53-54 (same author): Mortals must "put on" athanasia. The same word (athanasia) that God alone has in 1 Tim 6:16 is what mortals must acquire in 1 Cor 15:53.

### 1 Corinthians 15:42-54 -- The Resurrection Chapter

**Context:** Paul's extended argument for the reality and nature of the resurrection, which occupies the entire chapter. The immediate context (15:35-58) answers "How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?" (v.35). Paul establishes a series of contrasts between the present body and the resurrection body.

**Direct statements:**
- The body is "sown in corruption (phthora); raised in incorruption (aphtharsia)" (v.42).
- "Corruption (phthora) [does not] inherit incorruption (aphtharsia)" (v.50).
- "This corruptible must put on (endusasthai) incorruption (aphtharsia), and this mortal (thnetos) must put on (endusasthai) immortality (athanasia)" (v.53).
- "When this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory" (v.54).
- "The dead shall be raised incorruptible (aphthartos), and we shall be changed" (v.52).
- "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" (v.26).
- "By man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead" (v.21).
- "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (v.22).

**Key observations:**
- The verb enduo ("put on") in v.53 uses the aorist middle infinitive endusasthai. This is clothing language -- putting on something one does not currently wear. The mortal "puts on" immortality; the corruptible "puts on" incorruption. This is a transformation, not a revelation of something already present.
- "This mortal" (touto to thneton, v.53) -- the demonstrative pronoun touto points to the present mortal condition. Paul does not say "the body puts on immortality while the soul already has it." He says "this mortal" as a whole.
- The corruptible/incorruptible and mortal/immortal pairs are presented as mutually exclusive states with a transition point: "we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump" (vv.51-52). The change is future and instantaneous.
- Death entered "by man" (Adam, v.21). Death is called "the last enemy" to be "destroyed" (katargeo, v.26). If death is destroyed, athanasia is the resulting state.
- Paul quotes Isa 25:8 ("Death is swallowed up in victory," v.54) and Hos 13:14 ("O death, where is thy sting?" v.55), linking the resurrection to OT prophecy about the abolition of death.
- "In Adam all die" (v.22) -- death is universal through Adam. "In Christ shall all be made alive" (v.22) -- life is through Christ. The parallel structure shows death as the default human condition and life-through-Christ as the remedy.

**Cross-references:**
- Gen 2:7 (quoted in v.45): "The first man Adam was made a living soul." Paul connects the current human condition directly to the Genesis creation account.
- Gen 3:19 (thematic parallel): Dust returns to dust -- the corruptible body.
- Isa 25:8 (quoted in v.54): "He will swallow up death in victory." The OT source establishes that swallowing up death is a future divine act, not a present human condition.
- 2 Cor 5:4 (same author): "That mortality might be swallowed up of life." Uses the same "swallowed up" (katapino) language as 1 Cor 15:54.
- Rom 8:11 (same author): God will "quicken your mortal bodies" -- the same mortal (thnetos) bodies that must put on immortality.

---

### Romans 2:7 -- Seeking Immortality

**Context:** Paul's argument about God's righteous judgment. God "will render to every man according to his deeds" (v.6). Two outcomes are presented: (1) those who seek glory, honor, and immortality receive eternal life (v.7); (2) those who are contentious and disobey truth receive wrath (vv.8-9).

**Direct statement:** Those who "by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality (aphtharsia)" receive "eternal life."

**Key observations:**
- Aphtharsia is placed alongside "glory" and "honour" as objects of seeking (zeteo). The verb zeteo means to seek, look for, desire. One does not seek what one already possesses.
- The structure is conditional: seek X --> receive Y. "Seek immortality" --> "eternal life." If immortality were inherent, the seeking language would be incoherent.
- The contrast in vv.8-9 is between eternal life and wrath/tribulation/anguish -- not between two types of eternal existence.

**Cross-references:**
- 1 Tim 6:12, 19 (same author): "Lay hold on eternal life." Same concept: eternal life as something to be grasped, not inherently possessed.
- John 3:16 (thematic parallel): "Not perish, but have everlasting life." The alternative to everlasting life is perishing.
- Rom 6:23 (same author, same book): "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life." Death is the default outcome; eternal life is a gift.

---

### 2 Timothy 1:8-12 -- Christ Brought Life and Immortality to Light

**Context:** Paul's charge to Timothy to endure suffering for the gospel. Paul describes God's purpose and grace given in Christ "before the world began" (v.9), "but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality (aphtharsia) to light through the gospel" (v.10).

**Direct statement:** Christ "abolished" (katargeo) death and "brought to light" (photizo) life and aphtharsia through the gospel.

**Key observations:**
- Katargeo means to render inoperative, abolish, make of no effect. Christ has abolished death -- the same death that entered through Adam (1 Cor 15:21).
- Photizo means to illuminate, bring to light, make visible. Life and immortality were "brought to light" -- made available, revealed, illuminated -- through the gospel. This does not mean immortality existed hidden within humans; it means the gospel reveals the path to immortality.
- The pairing of "life" (zoe) with "immortality" (aphtharsia) connects eternal life and incorruptibility as related concepts revealed through Christ.

**Cross-references:**
- 1 Cor 15:26 (same author): Death is "the last enemy that shall be destroyed." 2 Tim 1:10 states Christ has already "abolished" death -- the process has begun through the gospel, with final completion at the resurrection.
- Rom 5:12, 17, 21 (same author): Death came through Adam; grace and life come through Christ.

---

### Romans 6:12 -- Mortal Body

**Context:** Paul's argument that believers are "dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ" (v.11). The practical instruction follows: "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal (thnetos) body" (v.12).

**Direct statement:** The human body is called thnetos (mortal, liable to die).

**Key observations:**
- Paul does not say "your mortal body and your immortal soul." The body is mortal. No other component is called immortal.
- The same chapter concludes: "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life" (v.23). The mortal body is subject to death; eternal life is a gift.

---

### Romans 8:11 -- Quickening Mortal Bodies

**Context:** Paul's discussion of life in the Spirit. If the Spirit of God dwells in believers, "he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal (thnetos) bodies by his Spirit" (v.11).

**Direct statement:** God will "quicken" (zoopoieo -- make alive, give life to) mortal bodies through the indwelling Spirit.

**Key observations:**
- The mortal bodies require future quickening. They are not already alive in themselves with immortality.
- The quickening is "by his Spirit that dwelleth in you" -- it is God's Spirit, not an inherent human quality, that produces life.
- The broader context (Rom 8:19-23) describes creation in "bondage of corruption (phthora)" (v.21) awaiting the "redemption of our body" (v.23). The body needs redemption from corruption.

---

### 2 Corinthians 4:7-14 -- Life Manifest in Mortal Flesh

**Context:** Paul's discussion of apostolic suffering. The treasure of the gospel is in "earthen vessels" (v.7). Paul is "always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal (thnetos) flesh" (vv.10-11).

**Direct statement:** Human flesh is called thnetos (mortal). The life of Jesus is "made manifest" in this mortal flesh.

**Key observations:**
- "Earthen vessels" (ostrakinos skeuos, v.7) -- clay pots. Fragile, breakable, temporary containers. This describes the human body.
- The "outward man" is perishing (diaphtheiro), but the "inward man" is "renewed day by day" (v.16). The renewal is a present spiritual process, not evidence of an inherent immortal soul.
- V.14 ties everything to resurrection: "he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also."

---

### 2 Corinthians 5:1-8 -- Mortality Swallowed Up of Life

**Context:** Continuation of Paul's discussion from ch. 4. Paul contrasts the present "earthly house of this tabernacle" (the body) with "a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens" (v.1).

**Direct statement:** Paul groans in this tabernacle, desiring to be "clothed upon" (ependuomai), "not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality (thnetos) might be swallowed up of life" (v.4).

**Key observations:**
- Paul uses the same "swallowed up" (katapino) language as 1 Cor 15:54. Mortality is the present condition; being "swallowed up of life" is the future hope.
- Paul expressly states he does NOT want to be "unclothed" (ekduo -- stripped of the body). He wants to be "clothed upon" (ependuomai -- to put on over). His desire is for the new body, not disembodied existence.
- Vv.6-8 express Paul's willingness to be "absent from the body, and present with the Lord." This is the passage cited for the conscious intermediate state. etc-01 classified this as I-B (I007 in the master), resolved Strong toward the conditionalist reading via SIS, because Paul's own explicit teaching in 1 Thess 4:16-17 ties being with the Lord to the resurrection.

---

### 1 Timothy 1:17 -- God Called Immortal

**Context:** A doxology inserted into Paul's testimony about receiving mercy.

**Direct statement:** God is called "the King eternal, immortal (aphthartos), invisible, the only wise God."

**Key observations:**
- God is aphthartos (incorruptible/immortal). In the same letter, God "only hath immortality (athanasia)" (6:16). Paul applies both aphthartos and athanasia to God within the same epistle.
- The cluster of divine attributes -- eternal, immortal, invisible, only wise -- sets God apart from creatures.

---

### Romans 1:23 -- Uncorruptible God vs. Corruptible Man

**Context:** Paul's argument about humanity's suppression of the knowledge of God. Humanity "changed the glory of the uncorruptible (aphthartos) God into an image made like to corruptible (phthartos) man" (v.23).

**Direct statement:** God is aphthartos (incorruptible); man is phthartos (corruptible). These are placed in direct grammatical contrast.

**Key observations:**
- The contrast is explicit: God = uncorruptible; man = corruptible. Paul does not say "man's body is corruptible but man's soul is incorruptible." Man as such is phthartos.
- This is consistent with 1 Cor 15:53 where the "corruptible" must put on "incorruption" -- the same corruptible/incorruptible contrast.

---

### 1 Peter 1:3-5, 23 -- Incorruptible Inheritance and Seed

**Context:** Peter's opening blessing, describing the "lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ" (v.3).

**Direct statements:**
- The inheritance is "incorruptible (aphthartos), and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven" (v.4).
- Believers are "born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible (aphthartos)" (v.23).

**Key observations:**
- The inheritance is incorruptible -- but it is "reserved in heaven" (v.4) and believers are "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time" (v.5). Incorruptibility describes the inheritance, not the present human condition.
- The incorruptible seed (v.23) is "the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever." The incorruptible element is God's word, not the human being born through it.

---

### 1 Peter 3:4 -- The Incorruptible Ornament

**Context:** Instructions for Christian wives.

**Direct statement:** "The hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible (aphthartos), even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit."

**Key observations:**
- "Not corruptible" describes the ornament (kosmos) -- the quality of a meek and quiet spirit. Peter contrasts outward adornment (corruptible) with inward character (incorruptible in value).
- This does not teach that the human heart or spirit is ontologically incorruptible. It teaches that the quality of meekness is of enduring value ("great price in the sight of God").

---

### 1 Corinthians 9:25 -- Incorruptible Crown

**Context:** Paul's discussion of self-discipline in the Christian life, using athletic imagery.

**Direct statement:** Athletes strive for a corruptible crown; believers strive for "an incorruptible (aphthartos)" crown.

**Key observations:**
- The incorruptible crown is a future reward, not a present possession. It is what believers strive toward, paralleling the seeking of immortality in Rom 2:7.

---

### B. Immortality-Related Passages from Nave's

---

### Genesis 3:22-24 -- Tree of Life

**Context:** Narrative immediately following the Fall. God states that man "is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever" (v.22). Man is then expelled from the garden and barred from the tree of life.

**Direct statement:** Man was barred from the tree of life to prevent him from "living for ever."

**Key observations:**
- The phrase "live for ever" (chay le'olam) indicates that man did NOT have inherent perpetual life after the Fall. If he did, barring him from the tree of life would serve no purpose.
- The tree of life sustained perpetual life. Without access to it, man is subject to death ("unto dust shalt thou return," Gen 3:19).
- This is the first passage in the Bible addressing human mortality, and it establishes mortality as the post-Fall human condition.
- Already registered as E006 in the master evidence file.

---

### Psalm 49:7-9, 14-15, 20 -- Redemption of the Soul; Man Perishes Like Beasts

**Context:** A wisdom psalm addressed to "all ye inhabitants of the world" (v.1). The psalm reflects on the inability of wealth to redeem from death.

**Direct statements:**
- "None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption" (vv.7-9).
- "Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them" (v.14).
- "God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me" (v.15).
- "Man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish" (v.12, 20).

**Key observations:**
- The psalmist states no human can ransom another from death. The soul's redemption is beyond human capacity ("it ceaseth for ever" -- the required price is too great).
- Man "is like the beasts that perish" (v.12, 20). The verb abad (perish) is the same word used in Ps 146:4 for thoughts perishing. Man's fate is compared to animals' -- as in Ecc 3:19-20.
- V.15 introduces hope: "God will redeem my soul from the power (yad, hand) of the grave (sheol)." The redemption is FROM sheol -- rescue from death, not continuation of consciousness within it. The verb padah (redeem) means to ransom, deliver. God does what no human can do (vv.7-9).

---

### Psalm 16:10-11 -- Not Left in Sheol

**Context:** A psalm of David expressing confidence in God.

**Direct statement:** "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell (sheol); neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption (shachath). Thou wilt shew me the path of life" (vv.10-11).

**Key observations:**
- Peter interprets this as a prophecy of Christ's resurrection (Acts 2:25-31): David's body saw corruption; Christ's did not.
- Paul makes the same argument in Acts 13:34-37.
- The psalm states that God will not leave the soul (nephesh) in sheol -- implying that without God's intervention, the nephesh would remain there. The nephesh is not self-sustaining.
- "The path of life" (v.11) is shown by God -- life comes from God, not from the self.

---

### Proverbs 14:32

**Direct statement:** "The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death."

**Key observations:**
- The righteous have "hope" (chaseh -- confidence, refuge) in death. Hope looks forward to something not yet possessed. The righteous person's confidence is that death is not the final word -- consistent with resurrection hope.
- The wicked are "driven away" (dachah -- thrust away, banished) -- a word of removal and separation.

---

### Ecclesiastes 3:19-21 -- One Breath, One Fate

**Context:** Solomon's observations on mortality. Already registered in the master evidence file (E008).

**Direct statements:**
- Man and beast have "one breath" (ruach echad) and one fate: death and return to dust (vv.19-20).
- "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?" (v.21).

**Key observations:**
- V.21 is a rhetorical question. The Hebrew uses the interrogative particle he, making both directions questionable: "Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward?" The question challenges assumptions about human superiority over animals regarding death.
- This is consistent with the broader Ecclesiastes theme: from observation, man and beast share the same fate.

---

### Isaiah 25:6-9 -- Death Swallowed Up in Victory

**Context:** Isaiah's vision of the eschatological feast. God will destroy the covering over all people, and "he will swallow up death in victory" (v.8).

**Direct statement:** God will swallow up (bala) death (maveth) in victory (lanetsach).

**Key observations:**
- This is the OT passage Paul quotes in 1 Cor 15:54. The abolition of death is a future divine act, not a present human condition.
- God destroys death. If humans were already immortal, death would not need to be "swallowed up."
- The passage is eschatological -- it describes what God will do, not what already is.

---

### Isaiah 26:19 -- Thy Dead Shall Live

**Direct statement:** "Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust."

**Key observations:**
- The dead "dwell in dust" -- they are in dust, not in conscious existence elsewhere.
- They are told to "awake" -- consistent with the death-as-sleep metaphor used across both testaments.
- The promise is resurrection: the dead SHALL live, they SHALL arise. Future tense. They do not currently live; they will be brought to life.

---

### Luke 20:34-38 -- Equal Unto the Angels; Cannot Die Anymore

**Context:** Jesus answers the Sadducees' challenge about the resurrection. The Sadducees, who deny resurrection (Acts 23:8), pose a hypothetical about seven brothers who married the same woman.

**Direct statements:**
- "They which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage" (v.35).
- "Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection" (v.36).
- "For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him" (v.38).

**Key observations:**
- "Neither can they die any more" -- the word ouketi (no longer) implies they could die before. The inability to die is a post-resurrection condition, not a pre-resurrection condition.
- They are "children of the resurrection" -- their immortality comes through resurrection.
- "Equal unto the angels" (isangeloi) -- this term appears only here in the NT. It describes a post-resurrection state, not a current human condition.
- V.38 -- "all live unto him" -- this statement is about God's relationship to the patriarchs. It functions as Jesus' proof that resurrection will happen (because God IS their God, they must live again). It does not describe a conscious intermediate state; it establishes that God's covenant with the patriarchs is not annulled by death.

---

### John 3:14-16, 36 -- Everlasting Life Through Belief

**Context:** Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus about being "born again" (v.3).

**Direct statements:**
- "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life" (v.15).
- "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (v.16).
- "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him" (v.36).

**Key observations:**
- The contrast is between perishing (apollymi) and having everlasting life (zoe aionios). These are presented as mutually exclusive outcomes. If the unbelieving already had inherent immortality, they would not "perish" -- they would continue to exist in some form.
- V.36: "shall not see life" -- the unbeliever does not see life at all. This is not "shall see life in a different, tormenting form." They "shall not see life."
- Eternal life is conditional on belief: "whosoever believeth."

---

### John 5:24-29, 39-40 -- Life in the Son

**Context:** Jesus' discourse on his authority and relationship to the Father.

**Direct statements:**
- "He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life" (v.24).
- "The Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself" (v.26).
- "They that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation" (v.29).
- "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life" (v.40).

**Key observations:**
- V.26: Life-in-himself is a divine attribute. The Father "hath life in himself" and has "given to the Son to have life in himself." This is self-existent life -- a quality of deity. No human is said to have "life in himself."
- V.29: Two resurrections are mentioned -- one to life, one to damnation (krisis -- judgment). Both require resurrection from death. Both groups are dead and raised.
- V.40: Jesus offers life. If humans already had inherent life/immortality, Jesus' offer would be redundant. "That ye might have life" presupposes they do not currently have it in the sense Jesus offers.

---

### John 6:27, 39-40, 44, 47, 50-51, 53-54, 58, 63, 68 -- Bread of Life Discourse

**Context:** Jesus' teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum after the feeding of the five thousand.

**Direct statements:**
- "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life" (v.27).
- "I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day" (v.39).
- "I will raise him up at the last day" (vv.40, 44, 54).
- "He that believeth on me hath everlasting life" (v.47).
- "If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever" (v.51).
- "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you" (v.53).
- "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing" (v.63).

**Key observations:**
- The phrase "I will raise him up at the last day" appears four times (vv.39, 40, 44, 54). Jesus connects eternal life to resurrection at the last day. The timing is eschatological.
- V.53: "Ye have no life in you" -- apart from Christ, there is no life (zoe) in humans. The statement is absolute: "no life in you."
- V.63: "The flesh profiteth nothing." The flesh (sarx) contributes nothing to eternal life. It is the spirit that gives life (zoopoieo).
- V.50: "That a man may eat thereof, and not die." The bread of life prevents death. Without it, humans die.

---

### John 10:27-28 -- Eternal Life Given

**Direct statement:** "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish" (v.28).

**Key observations:**
- Eternal life is something Jesus gives (didomi). It is a gift.
- "They shall never perish" -- the negation of perishing (apollymi) is the result of receiving eternal life. Without the gift, perishing is the implied default.

---

### John 11:25-26 -- The Resurrection and the Life

**Direct statement:** "I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."

**Key observations:**
- Jesus IS the resurrection and the life. Resurrection and life are located in him, not inherent in humanity.
- "Though he were dead, yet shall he live" -- the dead shall live. They are currently dead. Life comes through Christ.

---

### John 14:19 -- Because I Live

**Direct statement:** "Because I live, ye shall live also."

**Key observations:**
- Human life depends on Christ's life. The causal connection is explicit: "because I live" is the reason "ye shall live also." Without his life, theirs is not assured.

---

### John 17:2-3 -- Eternal Life Defined

**Direct statement:** "That he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ" (vv.2-3).

**Key observations:**
- Eternal life is given (didomi) by Christ to those the Father has given him. It is not an inherent possession.
- Eternal life is defined as knowing God and Jesus Christ. It is relational, not ontological.

---

### Romans 5:15-21 -- Free Gift Unto Life

**Context:** Paul's Adam/Christ typology.

**Direct statements:**
- "Through the offence of one many be dead" (v.15).
- "By one man's offence death reigned" (v.17).
- "They which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ" (v.17).
- "As sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord" (v.21).

**Key observations:**
- Death "reigned" (basileuo) through Adam. Life "reigns" through Christ. The reign of death is the default human condition; the reign of life is through Christ.
- Life is received through "abundance of grace" and "the gift of righteousness" -- it is a gift, not inherent.

---

### Romans 6:22-23 -- Wages of Sin vs. Gift of God

**Direct statement:** "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."

**Key observations:**
- Death is wages -- earned, deserved. Eternal life is a gift (charisma) -- unearned, given.
- The contrast is death vs. eternal life. Not death vs. a different quality of eternal existence. Death stands as the alternative to eternal life.
- This is among the most explicit statements in the NT on the conditional nature of eternal life.

---

### Galatians 6:7-8 -- Sow to Flesh: Corruption; Sow to Spirit: Life

**Direct statement:** "He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption (phthora); but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting."

**Key observations:**
- Two outcomes: corruption (phthora) or everlasting life (zoe aionios). These are exhaustive and mutually exclusive.
- Phthora is the antonym of aphtharsia (1 Cor 15:42, 50). To reap corruption is to reap the opposite of incorruption/immortality.
- No third option (corruption AND continued existence) is mentioned.

---

### 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9 -- Everlasting Destruction

**Direct statement:** The disobedient "shall be punished with everlasting destruction (olethros aionios) from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power."

**Key observations:**
- The punishment is called "destruction" (olethros -- ruin, destruction). *(Examined in depth in a later etc study.)*
- The adjective aionios modifies olethros ("destruction"), not a process of ongoing torment.
- "From the presence of the Lord" -- the destruction involves separation from God's presence.

---

### Titus 1:2 -- Promise of Eternal Life

**Direct statement:** "In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began."

**Key observations:**
- Eternal life is a promise (epaggelia) and a hope (elpis). Both words indicate something anticipated, not already fully realized.

---

### Hebrews 9:15 -- Promise of Eternal Inheritance

**Direct statement:** "They which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."

**Key observations:**
- The inheritance is eternal and promised -- future reception, not present possession in its fullness.

---

### 1 John 2:17, 25 -- Abiding Forever; Promise of Eternal Life

**Direct statements:**
- "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever" (v.17).
- "This is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life" (v.25).

**Key observations:**
- The world passes away. He that does God's will abides forever. Abiding forever is conditional on doing God's will.
- Eternal life is again called "the promise" -- it is something promised, not something inherently possessed.

---

### 1 John 5:11-13, 20 -- This Life Is in His Son

**Direct statements:**
- "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son" (v.11).
- "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life" (v.12).

**Key observations:**
- V.11: Eternal life is "in his Son" -- it resides in Christ. Humans access it through relationship with the Son.
- V.12: The binary is absolute: have the Son = have life; have not the Son = have not life. There is no third category where one "has not the Son" yet still has life in some other form.
- This is among the most explicit conditional-life statements in the NT.

---

### Revelation 22:5 -- Reign For Ever and Ever

**Direct statement:** "They shall reign for ever and ever."

**Key observations:**
- The context is the new earth and the eternal state (Rev 21-22). The "servants" of God and the Lamb reign forever.
- This is a statement about the redeemed in the eternal state, not a statement about inherent human immortality.

---

### C. Mortality of Man

---

### Job 4:17-21 -- Shall Mortal Man Be More Just Than God?

**Direct statements:**
- "Shall mortal man be more just than God?" (v.17). Already registered as E038.
- "How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?" (v.19).
- "They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it" (v.20).

**Key observations:**
- Enosh (mortal man) is the Hebrew word. It emphasizes frailty and mortality.
- "Houses of clay" -- the body. "Foundation in the dust" -- from dust, returning to dust (Gen 3:19).
- "Perish for ever (lanetsach) without any regarding it" (v.20) -- permanent perishing.

---

### Ecclesiastes 2:14-16 -- One Event Happeneth to All

**Direct statement:** "As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me...How dieth the wise man? as the fool" (vv.15-16).

**Key observations:**
- Death is universal -- wise and foolish die alike. The same event (miqreh -- occurrence, fate) happens to all.

---

### 1 Corinthians 15:21-22 -- In Adam All Die

**Direct statements:**
- "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead" (v.21).
- "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (v.22).

**Key observations:**
- Death came through Adam. All die in Adam. This is universal mortality.
- Being "made alive" (zoopoieo) is in Christ. Without Christ, death is the universal human condition.

---

### D. Corruption/Incorruption Contrast Passages

---

### Romans 8:19-23 -- Bondage of Corruption

**Direct statements:**
- "The creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption (phthora) into the glorious liberty of the children of God" (v.21).
- "We ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body" (v.23).

**Key observations:**
- The whole creation is in "bondage of corruption." This is a universal condition affecting all created things.
- Believers groan, "waiting for...the redemption of our body." The body requires future redemption. The present condition is corruption.

---

### 2 Peter 1:3-4 -- Partakers of the Divine Nature

**Direct statement:** "That by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption (phthora) that is in the world through lust."

**Key observations:**
- Participation in the divine nature is through God's "exceeding great and precious promises" (v.4). It is not inherent.
- Corruption is "in the world through lust" -- it is the present condition from which escape is needed.

---

### 2 Peter 2:12, 19 -- Perishing in Corruption

**Direct statements:**
- "These, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption (phthora)" (v.12).
- "They themselves are the servants of corruption (phthora)" (v.19).

**Key observations:**
- The wicked are compared to "natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed." The comparison to animals echoes Ps 49:12, 20 and Ecc 3:19.
- They "shall utterly perish (kataphtheiro) in their own corruption (phthora)." The outcome is perishing, not continued conscious existence in corruption.

---

### Acts 2:27-31; 13:34-37 -- Diaphthora and the Resurrection

**Direct statements:**
- David's body "saw corruption (diaphthora)" (Acts 13:36); Christ's body "saw no corruption" (Acts 13:37).
- Peter: David "is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day" (Acts 2:29).

**Key observations:**
- Bodily decay (diaphthora) is the normal post-death experience. David, despite being "a man after God's own heart," experienced it.
- Christ's resurrection before decay is presented as the exception that fulfilled prophecy.
- Peter contrasts David (dead, buried, body decayed) with Christ (raised, body did not decay). David awaits resurrection (consistent with Dan 12:2-3, 13).

---

### E. Angels and Immortality

---

### Luke 20:36 -- Equal Unto the Angels

**Direct statement:** "Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."

**Key observations:**
- The inability to die is future: "they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection" (v.35). It is POST-resurrection.
- "Neither can they die any more" -- ouketi = "no longer." This implies they COULD die before. The no-longer-dying state is gained through resurrection.
- They become "equal unto the angels" through resurrection, not through inherent nature.

---

### F. Life as a Divine Gift

---

### Deuteronomy 30:15-20 -- Life and Death Set Before You

**Direct statement:** "I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil...therefore choose life" (vv.15, 19). "For he [the LORD] is thy life, and the length of thy days" (v.20).

**Key observations:**
- Life and death are presented as two genuine options. If life were inherent and inescapable, setting death as a real alternative would be meaningless.
- God IS Israel's life. Life is not an inherent human property; it is identified with God himself.

---

### Job 27:3 -- Breath and Spirit of God

**Direct statement:** "All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils."

**Key observations:**
- Job identifies his breath as "the spirit of God" in his nostrils -- echoing Gen 2:7. His life is sustained by God's breath. It is not self-sustaining.

---

### Psalm 68:20 -- Issues from Death

**Direct statement:** "Unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death."

**Key observations:**
- The "issues from death" (totsa'ot lamaveth -- the exits/escapes from death) belong to God. Deliverance from death is God's prerogative, not a human capability.

---

### Acts 17:25-28 -- In Him We Live

**Direct statements:**
- "He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things" (v.25).
- "In him we live, and move, and have our being" (v.28).

**Key observations:**
- God gives life and breath to all. Life is a gift from God, not self-generated.
- Human existence is sustained "in him." Without God, there is no life, no movement, no being.
- Already registered as E036.

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Immortality as Exclusive Divine Attribute
God alone has athanasia (1 Tim 6:16). God is aphthartos (1 Tim 1:17; Rom 1:23). Man is phthartos (Rom 1:23). Man is thnetos (Rom 6:12; 8:11; 2 Cor 4:11; 5:4). In every NT passage where immortality/incorruptibility vocabulary is used of God and humans, they are placed in contrast, not in parallel. God possesses what humans lack.

### Pattern 2: Immortality as Future Gift at Resurrection
Athanasia is "put on" at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54). Aphtharsia is the resurrection state (1 Cor 15:42, 50, 52). Death is "swallowed up in victory" at the resurrection (1 Cor 15:54; Isa 25:8). The dead can "die no more" only after the resurrection (Luke 20:36). Mortal bodies are "quickened" in the future (Rom 8:11). In every case, the transition from mortality to immortality is future.

### Pattern 3: Eternal Life as Conditional Gift Through Christ
Eternal life is a "gift" (Rom 6:23), a "promise" (Tit 1:2; 1 John 2:25), a "hope" (Tit 3:7), something to "seek" (Rom 2:7), something to "lay hold on" (1 Tim 6:12, 19), something "given" by Jesus (John 10:28; 17:2), and located "in his Son" (1 John 5:11). He who has the Son has life; he who has not the Son "hath not life" (1 John 5:12). In every passage, eternal life is conditional on relationship with Christ.

### Pattern 4: The Alternative to Eternal Life is Perishing/Death
The contrast is always between everlasting life and perishing (John 3:16; 10:28), between life and death (Rom 6:23; Deut 30:15), between incorruption and corruption (1 Cor 15:42; Gal 6:8), between immortality and mortality. No passage presents the alternative as "eternal conscious existence in a different mode." The alternative to life is the absence of life.

### Pattern 5: Human Mortality is Universal and From Adam
Death came through Adam (Rom 5:12, 17; 1 Cor 15:21). In Adam all die (1 Cor 15:22). Man is mortal (Job 4:17; Rom 6:12). Man returns to dust (Gen 3:19; Ecc 3:20; 12:7). Man is like beasts that perish (Ps 49:12, 20; Ecc 3:19). The human body decays after death (Acts 13:36). Mortality is the baseline human condition since the Fall.

### Pattern 6: No NT Passage Applies Immortality Language to the Human Soul
The word athanasia (3x) is never applied to the human soul. Aphtharsia (8x) is never applied to the human soul. Aphthartos (7x) is never applied to the human soul. The phrase "immortal soul" does not appear in Scripture. The word thnetos (6x) is applied to human bodies/flesh without any contrasting "immortal" component being named.

## Connections Between Passages

### The Genesis-to-Corinthians Thread
Gen 2:7 (man formed from dust, became living soul) --> Gen 3:19, 22 (man returns to dust; barred from tree of life) --> Ecc 3:19-20; 12:7 (man and beast have one breath; dust returns to earth) --> 1 Cor 15:45-47 (Paul quotes Gen 2:7: first man Adam = living soul, earthy) --> 1 Cor 15:53-54 (this mortal must put on immortality). Paul builds his resurrection argument directly on the Genesis creation account, establishing that man's current state is mortal and earthy, requiring transformation.

### The John Thread
John 3:16 (believe --> not perish, but have everlasting life) --> John 5:26 (the Father has life in himself) --> John 6:53 (without Christ, "ye have no life in you") --> John 10:28 (Jesus gives eternal life; recipients shall not perish) --> John 11:25 (Jesus IS the resurrection and the life) --> 1 John 5:11-12 (eternal life is IN the Son; have Son = have life; have not Son = have not life). Throughout John's writings, eternal life is consistently located in Christ and received through relationship with him.

### The Pauline Contrast Thread
Rom 1:23 (God = incorruptible; man = corruptible) --> Rom 2:7 (seek immortality --> receive eternal life) --> Rom 5:12, 17, 21 (death through Adam; life through Christ) --> Rom 6:12, 23 (mortal body; wages = death, gift = eternal life) --> Rom 8:11, 21 (mortal bodies quickened; creation in bondage of corruption) --> 1 Cor 15:21-22, 42-54 (in Adam die; in Christ made alive; corruption/incorruption; mortal/immortal) --> 2 Cor 4:11; 5:4 (mortal flesh; mortality swallowed up) --> 1 Tim 6:16 (God only has immortality) --> 2 Tim 1:10 (Christ abolished death, brought immortality to light). Paul maintains a consistent framework across multiple letters: humans are mortal and corruptible; God is immortal and incorruptible; Christ bridges the gap through the gospel and resurrection.

## Word Study Insights

### athanasia (G110) -- 3 occurrences
The rarest immortality word. Used only of God's present possession (1 Tim 6:16) and believers' future acquisition at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54). Never used of human beings as a present condition.

### aphtharsia (G861) -- 8 occurrences
The broadest immortality word. Describes the resurrection state (1 Cor 15:42, 50, 53, 54), something to seek (Rom 2:7), something Christ revealed (2 Tim 1:10), and a quality of moral integrity (Eph 6:24; Tit 2:7). Never used of human beings as an inherent possession.

### thnetos (G2349) -- 6 occurrences
Applied to human bodies/flesh. Describes the current human condition. In 1 Cor 15:53-54, "this mortal" must put on immortality -- the mortal being is the subject of the transformation. No distinction is made between a mortal body and an immortal soul.

### aphthartos (G862) -- 7 occurrences
Applied to God (2x), future/heavenly things (3x), and spiritual qualities (2x). Man is explicitly called the opposite: phthartos (corruptible) in Rom 1:23. The incorruptible inheritance is "reserved in heaven" (1 Pet 1:4), not currently possessed.

### phthora (G5356) -- 9 occurrences
The antonym of aphtharsia. Describes the present condition of creation (Rom 8:21), the result of sowing to the flesh (Gal 6:8), and the fate of the wicked (2 Pet 2:12). Corruption is the current state; incorruption is the promised future.

### The Word-Family Pattern
In every case, the immortality/incorruption word family describes either (a) God's nature, (b) the future resurrection state, or (c) spiritual/heavenly qualities. In every case, the mortality/corruption word family describes either (a) the current human condition or (b) the result of sin. No passage crosses these lines to attribute present immortality to human beings.

## Difficult Passages

### 1 Peter 3:4 -- "That Which Is Not Corruptible"
Does "the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible" teach an incorruptible component of humans? The phrase describes the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit -- a quality of character, not an ontological statement about human composition. The contrast is between outward adornment (braided hair, gold, apparel) and inward character. Peter says the inward quality is "of great price in the sight of God" -- it is valuable, not metaphysically immortal.

### John 5:26 -- Life in Himself
"The Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself." Does this show an inherent life-force? It shows that self-existent life is a divine attribute. The Father has it; the Son has it by the Father's gift. No human is said to have "life in himself." This passage reinforces that life originates in God.

### Luke 20:38 -- "All Live Unto Him"
"For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him." Does this teach that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are currently alive? The statement functions as Jesus' argument for the future resurrection (v.37: "Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed..."). Jesus is arguing that God's covenant relationship with the patriarchs guarantees their future resurrection, not describing their present conscious state. "All live unto him" means God regards them as living (from his perspective, their resurrection is certain), not that they are currently conscious.

### 2 Peter 1:4 -- Partakers of the Divine Nature
Does "partakers of the divine nature" mean humans share God's immortality? The context specifies how: "through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue" (v.3), and the result is "having escaped the corruption that is in the world" (v.4). This is moral/spiritual transformation through knowledge of God, enabled by his promises. It does not attribute ontological immortality to humans.
