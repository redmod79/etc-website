### Key Observations from Nave's Entries

1. **Nave's IMMORTALITY entry** contains 71+ references but does not distinguish between "inherent immortality" and "conditional immortality." It lists all scriptures relating to the subject of continued existence beyond death, including passages about resurrection, eternal life, and the nature of the soul.

2. **Nave's MAN > MORTAL** lists 5 references (Job 4:17; Ecc 2:14-15; 3:20; 1 Cor 15:21-22; Heb 9:27) that explicitly describe man as mortal.

3. **Nave's MAN > IMMORTAL** simply cross-references to IMMORTALITY -- it does not independently assert that man is immortal. This is a reference to the topic, not a doctrinal claim.

4. **Nave's GIFTS FROM GOD** lists ROM 6:23 under "unclassified scriptures relating to both temporal and spiritual" -- "the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Also includes JHN 3:16 under "spiritual gifts: Christ, the Saviour."

5. **Nave's LIFE > FROM GOD** (11 references) consistently presents life as originating from God and sustained by God, not as inherently possessed by humans.

6. **Nave's LIFE > EVERLASTING** (40+ references) -- the majority of these references present eternal life as something received through faith in Christ (John's Gospel dominates), not as something inherently possessed.
