### IMMORTALITY

**Full Nave's Entry:**

General scriptures concerning:
GEN 5:24; 2SA 12:23; 2KI 2:11; NEH 9:5; JOB 4:17-21; 14:13; PSA 16:10,11; 21:4; 22:26; 23:6; 31:5; 36:9; 37:18,27; 49:7-9,14,15; 73:26; 86:12; 102:4,25-28; 121:8; 133:3; 145:1,2; PRO 14:32; ECC 3:21; 12:7; ISA 14:9; 25:8; 26:19; 38:18,19; EZK 32:31; DAN 12:2,3; MAT 10:28; 16:26; 19:16,17; 25:46; MRK 10:30; 12:26,27; LUK 9:25; 10:25-28; 20:36-38; JHN 3:14-16,36; 5:39,40; 6:39,40,44,47,50,51,53,54,58; 10:28; 11:25,26; 14:19; 17:2,3; ACT 20:32; 23:8,9; 26:7,8,18; ROM 2:7; 6:22,23; 1CO 15:12-55; GAL 6:8; COL 1:5,6; 1TH 4:13-18; 5:10; 2TH 1:7-9; 2:16; 1TI 4:8; 6:12,19; 2TI 1:9,10; TIT 1:2; 3:7; HEB 9:15; 10:34; 11:5,10,13-16; 1PE 1:3-5; 1JN 2:17,25; 5:13; Jude 1:21; REV 1:7; 3:4; 22:5

Cross-references: See RESURRECTION; See RIGHTEOUS, PROMISES TO; See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Structural Note:** Nave's organizes IMMORTALITY under a single heading of "general scriptures concerning" — there is no subdivision for "God's immortality" vs. "human immortality." The full range of references covers: OT anticipations of life beyond death (Psalms, Job, Daniel, Isaiah), NT eternal life promises (John 3, John 10-11, John 17), resurrection texts (1 Cor 15, 1 Thess 4), and mortality/incorruption word study passages (Rom 2:7; 1 Tim 6:16; 2 Tim 1:10).

**Critical Observations from Nave's Structure:**
1. Nave's does NOT subdivide immortality into "presently possessed by humans" vs. "future gift at resurrection." The entire entry is under one heading, leaving the nature and timing of immortality to further study.
2. The cross-reference to RESURRECTION is significant — Nave's organizes IMMORTALITY and RESURRECTION as related topics, not separate ones.
3. The OT references (Gen 5:24 = Enoch; 2 Ki 2:11 = Elijah) relate to exceptional cases of translation (exemption from death), not ordinary human immortality.

### RESURRECTION

**Full Nave's Entry:**

General scriptures concerning:
JOB 14:12-15; 19:25-27; PSA 16:9,10; 17:15; 49:15; ISA 25:8; 26:19; EZK 37:1-14; DAN 12:2,3,13; HOS 13:14; MAT 22:23-32; 24:31; 25:1-13; 27:52,53; MRK 12:18-27; LUK 14:14; 20:27-38; JHN 5:21,25,28,29; 6:39,40,44,54; 11:23-25; 14:19; ACT 2:26-31; 4:1,2; 17:18,32; 23:6,8; 24:14,15; 26:6-8; ROM 4:16-21; 8:10,11,19,21-23; 1CO 6:14; 15:12-32,35-57; 2CO 4:14; 5:1-5; PHP 3:10,11,21; 1TH 4:14,16; 2TI 1:10; 2:18; HEB 6:2; 11:19,35; REV 1:18; 20:4-6,13

See DEAD, RAISED; Of Jesus — See JESUS

Figurative (of regeneration): ROM 6:4; EPH 2:1,5,6; COL 2:12; 3:1
Typified (Isaac): GEN 22:13; with HEB 11:19
Typified (Jonah): JON 2:10; with MAT 12:40
Symbolical: REV 11:11

**Critical Observations from Nave's Structure:**
1. Nave's lists 2 Tim 1:10 under RESURRECTION (not just under IMMORTALITY) — confirming that Christ "abolishing death" and "bringing life and immortality to light" is understood as directly connected to resurrection.
2. The Figurative use (Rom 6:4 = regeneration) is distinguished from the literal resurrection. Nave's does not conflate spiritual new birth with physical resurrection.
3. Rev 20:4-6,13 (first and second resurrections) is included — relevant to the two-destiny outcome.

### CORRUPTION (Physical Decomposition)

**Full Nave's Entry:**

Physical decomposition: LEV 22:25
After death: GEN 3:19; JOB 17:14; 21:26; 34:15; PSA 16:10; 49:9; 104:29; ECC 3:20; 12:7; JON 2:6; ACT 2:27,31; 13:34-37; 1CO 15:42,50

Figurative (of sin): ISA 38:17; ROM 8:21; GAL 6:8; 2PE 1:4; 2:12,19
Mount of: 2KI 23:13
Judicial/Ecclesiastical/Political: [See COURT; CHURCH; BRIBERY — not relevant to this study]

**Critical Observations:**
1. The physical decomposition sub-entry is the directly relevant section. The after-death references include Psa 16:10 (David's prophecy that God's Holy One will not see corruption — applied to Jesus in Acts 2:27,31 and 13:34-37).
2. 1 Cor 15:42 and 15:50 are the direct NT word study texts (sown in corruption / flesh and blood cannot inherit).
3. Nave's confirms that "corruption" (phthora/G5356 related to G5349 phthartos) is the natural state of the body after death.

### TREE (Tree of Life)

**Full Nave's Entry:**

Of life: GEN 2:9; 3:22,24; REV 22:14
Of knowledge: GEN 2:9,17; 3:3-6,11,12,17
Figurative: PSA 1:3; JER 17:8
Symbolical: DAN 4:10-12

**Critical Observations:**
1. Nave's lists only three references under "Tree of life" — GEN 2:9; 3:22,24; REV 22:14. Note that REV 2:7 and REV 22:2 are not listed here but are part of the tree of life theme.
2. The tree of life appears at the beginning (paradise lost, Gen 2-3) and the end (paradise restored, Rev 22). Nave's captures the bookend structure.
3. The absence of any intermediate OT references is significant — between Eden and the new creation, the tree of life is inaccessible. Access to the tree of life IS access to immortality.

### SOUL (Nave's cross-reference entry)

**Full Nave's Entry:**

See SPIRIT
See IMMORTALITY
See MAN, A SPIRIT
See RIGHTEOUS, FUTURE STATE OF
See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Note:** Nave's has no independent entry for SOUL — it functions entirely as a cross-reference hub. The linkage to IMMORTALITY confirms that Nave's treats soul-nature and immortality as connected topics.

---

### SECOND DEATH

**Full Nave's Entry:**

General scriptures concerning: REV 20:14
See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Note:** The minimal Nave's entry for Second Death is notable. The concept is present in the Bible in more places (Rev 2:11; 20:6; 21:8) but Nave's lists only the definitional text (Rev 20:14).

### DEATH — Selected Entries Relevant to This Study

**Called SLEEP:**
DEU 31:16; JOB 7:21; 14:12; JER 51:39; DAN 12:2; JHN 11:11; ACT 7:60; 13:36; 1CO 15:6,18,51; 1TH 4:14,15

**Exemption from death:**
- Enoch: GEN 5:24; HEB 11:5
- Elijah: 2KI 2
- Saints at second coming: 1CO 15:51; 1TH 4:15,17
- No death in heaven: LUK 20:36; REV 21:4

**Second death references (under DEATH entry):**
PRO 14:12; EZK 18:4,10,13,21,23,24; 33:8,9,11,14-16; MAT 7:13; 10:28; 25:30,41,46; MRK 9:43,44; ROM 1:32; 6:16,21,23; 8:13; 9:22; 2TH 1:9; JAS 1:15; 4:12; 2PE 2:12; REV 2:11; 19:20; 20:14; 21:8

**Called sleep:** Nave's Death entry groups all the "death = sleep" passages together — a unified thematic thread across both testaments.
