## athanasia -- G110
**Original:** athanasia
**Transliteration:** athanasia
**Pronunciation:** ath-an-as-ee
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**Definition:** from a compound of alpha (as a negative particle) and thanatos (G2288, death); deathlessness
**BLB Count:** 3

### Translations
- 3 (100%) "immortality"

### All Verses (3 total -- complete list)

| Verse | Text | Subject | Timing |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| 1 Cor 15:53 | "this mortal must put on **immortality**" | believers | future (resurrection) |
| 1 Cor 15:54 | "this mortal shall have put on **immortality**" | believers | future (resurrection) |
| 1 Tim 6:16 | "[God] who only hath **immortality**" | God | present (inherent) |

### Key Observations
1. Athanasia occurs only 3 times in the entire NT. It is never applied to human beings as a present possession.
2. The only entity said to currently possess (echon) athanasia is God (1 Tim 6:16), modified by "only" (monos).
3. In both 1 Cor 15 occurrences, athanasia is something "put on" (enduo) by mortal beings at the resurrection -- not something already possessed.
4. The word is a direct negation of thanatos (death): a-thanasia = "deathlessness."

### Etymology
- alpha privative (a-) = "not, without"
- thanatos (G2288) = "death"
- Result: "without death" = "deathlessness"

**Original:** aphtharsia
**Transliteration:** aphtharsia

**"immortality" (2x):**
| Verse | Text | Subject |
|-------|------|---------|
| Rom 2:7 | "seek for glory and honour and **immortality**, eternal life" | believers seek it |

| 1 Cor 15:50 | "corruption [cannot] inherit **incorruption**" | resurrection body |
| 1 Cor 15:53 | "this corruptible must put on **incorruption**" | resurrection body |
| 1 Cor 15:54 | "this corruptible shall have put on **incorruption**" | resurrection body |

**"sincerity" / "uncorruptness" (2x):**
| Verse | Text | Subject |
|-------|------|---------|
| Eph 6:24 | "love our Lord Jesus Christ in **sincerity**" | quality of love |
| Tit 2:7 | "in doctrine shewing **uncorruptness**, gravity, sincerity" | quality of teaching |

### Key Observations
1. When translated "immortality," aphtharsia is something humans must seek (Rom 2:7) or that Christ brought to light (2 Tim 1:10) -- not something already possessed.
2. When translated "incorruption," it describes the future state of the resurrection body (1 Cor 15) -- the transformation from corruptible to incorruptible.
3. The "sincerity" usage shows the word's root meaning: freedom from decay/corruption in any sense -- moral, physical, or ontological.
4. In no occurrence is aphtharsia said to be an inherent human possession.

## thnetos -- G2349
**Original:** thnetos
**Transliteration:** thnetos
**Pronunciation:** thnay-tos
**Part of Speech:** adjective (adj)
**Definition:** from thnesko (to die); liable to die: mortal(-ity)
**BLB Count:** 6

### Translations
- 5 (83.3%) "mortal"
- 1 (16.7%) "mortality"

### All Verses (6 total -- complete list)

| Verse | Text | What is called thnetos |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| Rom 6:12 | "your **mortal** body" | the body |
| Rom 8:11 | "your **mortal** bodies" | the body (future quickening promised) |
| 1 Cor 15:53 | "this **mortal** must put on immortality" | the mortal being |
| 1 Cor 15:54 | "this **mortal** shall have put on immortality" | the mortal being |
| 2 Cor 4:11 | "our **mortal** flesh" | the flesh |
| 2 Cor 5:4 | "**mortality** might be swallowed up of life" | the mortal condition |

### Key Observations
1. Thnetos is applied to the human body/flesh in 4 of 6 occurrences (Rom 6:12; 8:11; 2 Cor 4:11; 5:4).
2. In 1 Cor 15:53-54, "this mortal" (touto to thneton) is presented as the subject that must "put on" immortality -- the mortal puts on immortality, not a part of the human that already has it.
3. No occurrence of thnetos distinguishes between a "mortal body" and an "immortal soul." The whole person is addressed as mortal.
4. The word is from thnesko (to die) -- it describes that which is subject to death.

### Hebrew Sources (from Strong's cross-reference)
- H120: adam (human being) -- count: 3, PMI: 5.05
  This connects thnetos to "adam" (humankind), reinforcing that mortality is predicated of humans as such.

| 1 Pet 1:23 | "born again, not of corruptible seed, but of **incorruptible**" |
| 1 Pet 3:4 | "the hidden man of the heart, in that which is **not corruptible**" |

### Key Observations
1. God is called aphthartos (1 Tim 1:17; Rom 1:23). Man is explicitly contrasted as corruptible (phthartos) in Rom 1:23.
2. The resurrection body is called aphthartos (1 Cor 15:52) -- the dead are raised incorruptible, meaning they were previously corruptible.
3. The heavenly inheritance is aphthartos (1 Pet 1:4) -- reserved in heaven, not something presently possessed on earth.
4. The "incorruptible seed" (1 Pet 1:23) and "hidden man of the heart" (1 Pet 3:4) apply aphthartos to spiritual qualities/new birth, not to inherent human nature.

- 1 Cor 15:50 -- "neither doth **corruption** [phthora] inherit incorruption [aphtharsia]"

**Corruption as the result of sin:**
- Gal 6:8 -- "he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap **corruption** [phthora]"
- 2 Pet 2:12 -- "shall utterly perish in their own **corruption** [phthora]"
- 2 Pet 2:19 -- "they themselves are the servants of **corruption** [phthora]"

**Bondage of corruption:**
- Rom 8:21 -- "the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of **corruption** [phthora]"

- 2 Pet 1:4 -- "having escaped the **corruption** [phthora] that is in the world through lust"

**Perishing with use:**
- Col 2:22 -- "Which all are to **perish** [phthora] with the using"

### Key Observations
1. Phthora is the antonym of aphtharsia. The corruption/incorruption contrast in 1 Cor 15 is phthora vs. aphtharsia.
2. Creation is in "bondage of corruption" (Rom 8:21), waiting for deliverance.
3. Corruption is linked to the flesh and sin: sowing to the flesh reaps corruption (Gal 6:8).
4. Corruption is the present human condition from which deliverance is needed.

### Hebrew Sources
- H3588: ki (particle) -- count: 3, PMI: 1.83 (not conceptually significant)

## diaphthora -- G1312
**Original:** diaphthora
**Transliteration:** diaphthora
**Pronunciation:** dee-af-thor-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**Definition:** from diaphtheiro (to corrupt/destroy utterly); decay: corruption
**BLB Count:** 6

### Translations
- 6 (100%) "corruption"

### All Verses (6 total -- complete list, all in Acts)

| Verse | Text | Context |
|-------|------|---------|
| Acts 2:27 | "neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see **corruption**" | Peter quoting Ps 16:10 |
| Acts 2:31 | "neither his flesh did see **corruption**" | Peter interpreting Ps 16 |
| Acts 13:34 | "no more to return to **corruption**" | Paul in Antioch |
| Acts 13:35 | "Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see **corruption**" | Paul quoting Ps 16 |
| Acts 13:36 | "David...saw **corruption**" | Paul: David's body decayed |
| Acts 13:37 | "he, whom God raised again, saw no **corruption**" | Paul: Christ's body did not |

### Key Observations
1. All 6 uses of diaphthora are in apostolic sermons interpreting Psalm 16:10 as fulfilled in Christ's resurrection.
2. The argument in both Acts 2 and Acts 13: David died and his body saw corruption (diaphthora); Christ died but his body did NOT see corruption because God raised him.
3. This demonstrates that bodily decay/corruption is the normal human experience after death -- David's body decayed. The exception was Christ's resurrection before decay could occur.
4. Diaphthora refers to physical decomposition -- the decay of the body after death.

### Hebrew Sources (top 3)
- H7845: shachath (pit, corruption) -- count: 8, PMI: 8.49, score: 18.65
- H7568: resheth (net) -- count: 3, PMI: 7.20
- H7843: shachath (to decay, destroy) -- count: 3, PMI: 4.52

Note: shachath (H7845/H7843) is the Hebrew word behind "corruption" in Psalm 16:10 that diaphthora translates in the LXX.
