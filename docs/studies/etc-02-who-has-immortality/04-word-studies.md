## Overview

This study examines five Greek words that form the NT vocabulary of immortality/incorruption, and five Hebrew words that provide the OT conceptual background. There is no single Hebrew equivalent to the Greek `athanasia` (deathlessness) — the OT expresses the concept through words for life (`chay`), eternity (`olam`), death (`muwth`/`maveth`), and the soul-being (`nephesh`). The NT precision in vocabulary reflects a conceptual sharpening that occurs with the gospel revelation.

## G110 — ἀθανασία (athanasía) — IMMORTALITY

**Original:** ἀθανασία
**Transliteration:** athanasía
**Pronunciation:** ath-an-as-ee-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Etymology:** from `a-` (negative particle) + `thanatos` (death) = "deathlessness"
**Strong's Count:** 3 occurrences (all translated "immortality")

### Definition

Deathlessness; the state of being exempt from death. A compound negative: the alpha privative (`a-`) negates `thanatos` (death), producing a word meaning the absolute absence of the possibility of dying.

### Translations

| KJV Translation | Count | Percentage |

| immortality | 3 | 100% |

G110 is the most specific NT word for immortality — it denotes not merely long life or incorruption of body but the impossibility of death. The KJV renders it "immortality" in all three occurrences without variation.

### All KJV Occurrences

**1 Corinthians 15:53**
> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this **mortal** [must] put on **immortality** [athanasian].

**1 Corinthians 15:54**
> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this **mortal** shall have put on **immortality** [athanasian], then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

**1 Timothy 6:16**
> Who only hath **immortality** [athanasian], dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom [be] honour and power everlasting. Amen.

### Key Observations

1. **Exclusive divine possession (1 Tim 6:16):** The subject is God — "who only hath immortality." The Greek `μόνος ἔχων ἀθανασίαν` (monos echon athanasian) = "the only one having immortality." This is an exclusive, not comparative, claim. `Monos` (alone/only) functions as a substantival adjective. No human presently shares this attribute.

2. **Future human reception (1 Cor 15:53-54):** The word appears in the context of the resurrection transformation. The verb is `enduomai` (to put on/clothe oneself) — an aorist middle infinitive, indicating a future, decisive act of appropriation. The present human state is `thnetos` (mortal, G2349); the future transformed state will be `athanasia` (immortality). The "must" (`dei`) indicates divine necessity.

3. **Contrast structure:** In 1 Cor 15:53-54, `athanasia` (immortality, G110) is paired with `thnetos` (mortal, G2349) — the thing that must be put on is the antithesis of the present condition. Separately, `aphtharsia` (incorruption, G861) is paired with `phthartos` (corruptible, G5349). Two distinct transformations are described in one event.

4. **Rarity:** G110 occurs only 3 times in the NT. This rarity is significant — Paul uses it only in the definitive resurrection chapter (1 Cor 15) and in the statement about God's unique nature (1 Tim 6:16). The concept is not scattered throughout the NT; it is concentrated in these theological-climactic texts.

### LXX / OT Background

There is no Hebrew word equivalent to `athanasia`. The OT approaches the concept through:
- `chay le-olam` (חַי לְעֹלָם, H2416 + H5769) = "live forever" — the phrase God uses in Gen 3:22 for the immortality man would have gained from the tree of life
- `chayyei olam` (חַיֵּי עֹולָם, Dan 12:2) = "everlasting life" — the resurrection destiny of the righteous
- The LXX does not use `athanasia` in these OT passages; the word appears in the Apocrypha (Wisdom of Solomon 3:4; 4:1; 8:13,17; 15:3) as a developed Second Temple concept

## G861 — ἀφθαρσία (aphtharsía) — INCORRUPTION / IMMORTALITY

**Original:** ἀφθαρσία
**Transliteration:** aphtharsía
**Pronunciation:** af-thar-see-ah
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Etymology:** from `a-` (negative particle) + `phtheiro` (to corrupt, decay) = "incorruptibility"
**Strong's Count:** 8 occurrences

### Definition

Incorruptibility; the state of being exempt from decay and corruption. From `phtheiro` (to corrupt, destroy, spoil). While G110 (`athanasia`) focuses on the impossibility of death, G861 (`aphtharsia`) focuses on the impossibility of corruption/decay. In the resurrection context, both concepts apply together.

### Translations

| KJV Translation | Count | Percentage | Verses |
|----------------|-------|------------|--------|
| incorruption | 4 | 50% | 1 Cor 15:42,50,53,54 |
| immortality | 2 | 25% | Rom 2:7; 2 Tim 1:10 |
| sincerity | 2 | 25% | Eph 6:24; Tit 2:7 |

Note: The "sincerity" translation in Ephesians 6:24 and Titus 2:7 reflects the extended meaning of `aphtharsia` — love or doctrine that is "uncorrupted" (pure, genuine). This is a distinct usage from the immortality/resurrection context.

### All KJV Occurrences

**Romans 2:7**
> To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and **immortality** [aphtharsian], eternal life:

**1 Corinthians 15:42**
> So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in **incorruption** [aphtharsia]:

**1 Corinthians 15:50**
> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit **incorruption** [aphtharsia].

**1 Corinthians 15:53**
> For this corruptible must put on **incorruption** [aphtharsian], and this mortal [must] put on immortality.

**1 Corinthians 15:54**
> So when this corruptible shall have put on **incorruption** [aphtharsian], and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

**Ephesians 6:24**
> Grace [be] with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in **sincerity** [aphtharsia]. Amen.

**2 Timothy 1:10**
> But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and **immortality** [aphtharsian] to light through the gospel:

**Titus 2:7**
> In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine [shewing] uncorruptness, gravity, **sincerity** [aphtharsian],

### Key Observations

1. **Seeking as evidence of present lack (Rom 2:7):** Paul describes those who "seek" (`zetousin`, G2212 — Present Active Participle) for `aphtharsia`. One seeks what one does not yet possess. This is a direct implication that `aphtharsia` is not a present human possession but a future goal. The seeking is "by patient continuance in well doing" — it is the reward at the end of the righteous life, not an innate endowment.

2. **Resurrection event language (1 Cor 15:42-54):** The sequence in 1 Cor 15 is: sown in corruption → raised in incorruption (v.42); flesh and blood cannot inherit (v.50); must put on incorruption (v.53); shall have put on incorruption → Death swallowed up (v.54). The `aphtharsia` belongs to the raised/transformed state, not the present state.

3. **Christ brings it to light (2 Tim 1:10):** Christ "brought life and `aphtharsia` to light through the gospel." The verb is `photizo` (to illuminate/bring to light) — Christ did not create immortality but revealed/made accessible what was always God's purpose. The aorist participle indicates this illumination was accomplished at the appearing of Christ.

4. **Relation to G110:** In 1 Cor 15:53-54, `aphtharsia` and G110 (`athanasia`) appear in parallel clauses — they describe the same resurrection transformation from two angles: `phthartos` → `aphtharsia` (corruptible → incorruption = body transformation) and `thnetos` → `athanasia` (mortal → immortality = life transformation).

## G862 — ἄφθαρτος (áphthartos) — INCORRUPTIBLE

**Original:** ἄφθαρτος
**Transliteration:** áphthartos
**Pronunciation:** af-thar-tos
**Part of Speech:** adjective
**Etymology:** from `a-` (negative particle) + derivative of `phtheiro` (to corrupt) = "undecaying"
**Strong's Count:** 7 occurrences

### Definition

Undecaying, incorruptible, immortal. The adjectival form of the same root as G861 (`aphtharsia`). Used to describe: God (his glory), a crown (reward for athletes), the body (at resurrection), an inheritance, seed, and the hidden person of the heart.

### Translations

| KJV Translation | Count | Verses |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| incorruptible | 2 | 1 Cor 15:52; 1 Pet 1:4 |

| of incorruptible | 1 | 1 Pet 1:23 |

| is not corruptible | 1 | 1 Pet 3:4 |

### All KJV Occurrences

**Romans 1:23**
> And changed the glory of the **uncorruptible** [aphthartou] God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

**1 Corinthians 9:25**
> And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we **an incorruptible** [aphtharton].

**1 Corinthians 15:52**
> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised **incorruptible** [aphthartoi], and we shall be changed.

**1 Timothy 1:17**
> Now unto the King eternal, **immortal** [aphtharto], invisible, the only wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

**1 Peter 1:4**
> To an inheritance **incorruptible** [aphtharton], and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,

**1 Peter 1:23**
> Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of **incorruptible** [aphthartou], by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

**1 Peter 3:4**
> But [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in that which **is not corruptible** [aphtharto], [even the ornament] of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.

### Key Observations

1. **God is `aphthartos` (Rom 1:23; 1 Tim 1:17):** These are the only two NT texts that directly apply an `aphthartos`-root word to God himself. Romans 1:23 contrasts the uncorruptible God with corruptible man and creatures. 1 Tim 1:17 calls God "King eternal, immortal [aphthartos], invisible" — the same letter where 6:16 declares he "alone has immortality [athanasia]." These are complementary divine attributes.

2. **Resurrection body (1 Cor 15:52):** The dead are raised "incorruptible" (`aphthartoi`) — this is the future state of the redeemed body. At present, the body is `phthartos` (corruptible, G5349); at resurrection it becomes `aphthartos` (incorruptible, G862).

3. **Contrast with corruptible crown (1 Cor 9:25):** Athletes strive for a `phthartos` (corruptible/perishable) crown; believers strive for an `aphthartos` (incorruptible) crown. The incorruptible crown is a future reward, not a present possession.

4. **Inheritance and seed (1 Pet 1:4,23):** The inheritance is `aphthartos` — reserved in heaven, awaiting future reception. The born-again seed (`spora`) from which believers come is `aphthartos` — the regenerating word of God. This shows the two-direction use of the word: describing the present means of regeneration (incorruptible seed = the word) and the future state of what is received (incorruptible inheritance).

## G2349 — θνητός (thnētós) — MORTAL

**Original:** θνητός
**Transliteration:** thnētós
**Pronunciation:** thnay-tos
**Part of Speech:** adjective
**Etymology:** from `thnesko` (to die) = "liable to die"
**Strong's Count:** 6 occurrences

### Definition

Mortal; subject to death; liable to die. Derived from `thnesko` (the root verb for dying). In every NT occurrence, `thnetos` describes the present human condition — the body or flesh as currently subject to death. It is always used of humans and always in contrast to the immortal/incorruptible state that comes at resurrection.

### Translations

| KJV Translation | Count | Verses |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| mortal | 5 | Rom 6:12; Rom 8:11; 1 Cor 15:53; 1 Cor 15:54; 2 Cor 4:11 |
| mortality | 1 | 2 Cor 5:4 |

### All KJV Occurrences

**Romans 6:12**
> Let not sin therefore reign in your **mortal** [thneto] body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.

**Romans 8:11**
> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your **mortal** [thneta] bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

**1 Corinthians 15:53**
> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this **mortal** [thneton] [must] put on immortality.

**1 Corinthians 15:54**
> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this **mortal** [thneton] shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

**2 Corinthians 4:11**
> For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our **mortal** [thnetei] flesh.

**2 Corinthians 5:4**
> For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that **mortality** [to thneton] might be swallowed up of life.

### Key Observations

1. **Universal present human condition:** `Thnetos` is used of every believer's current body/flesh without exception. Not a single NT text applies `thnetos` to humans in any qualified or partial sense — the present mortal body is simply `thneton` (mortal). There is no "partially immortal soul" vocabulary here.

2. **Contrast with immortality (1 Cor 15:53-54):** The direct antithesis: `thneton` (mortal) must put on `athanasia` (immortality, G110). Present state = mortal; future resurrection state = immortal. The transformation is necessary (`dei`, G1163) and future.

3. **Spirit-quickening of mortal bodies (Rom 8:11):** The promise is that the Spirit will "quicken" (`zoopoieo`) "your mortal [thneta] bodies." This quickening is a future resurrection event, not a present spiritual experience — the body is described as still mortal at the time of writing.

4. **Mortality swallowed up by life (2 Cor 5:4):** This verse anticipates the same event as 1 Cor 15:54 — "mortality swallowed up of life" echoes "Death is swallowed up in victory." The `thneton` (mortality) is the present condition of the body in this life; its swallowing up is the resurrection transformation.

5. **Mortal body subject to sin (Rom 6:12):** "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body" — the present body's mortality is connected to its susceptibility to sin's reign. This reflects the Genesis 3 connection: mortality entered through sin; in this fallen-mortal body, sin seeks to rule.

## G5349 — φθαρτός (phthartós) — CORRUPTIBLE

**Original:** φθαρτός
**Transliteration:** phthartós
**Pronunciation:** fthar-tos
**Part of Speech:** adjective
**Etymology:** from `phtheiro` (to corrupt, decay) = "decayed, perishable"
**Strong's Count:** 6 occurrences

### Definition

Corruptible, perishable, subject to decay. The adjectival form from `phtheiro`. While `thnetos` (G2349) describes the body as "subject to death," `phthartos` describes it as "subject to corruption/decay." Both describe the present state of the unredeemed body; both are resolved at resurrection.

### Translations

| KJV Translation | Count | Verses |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| corruptible | 3 | 1 Cor 15:53; 1 Cor 15:54; 1 Pet 1:23 |
| to corruptible | 1 | Rom 1:23 |
| a corruptible | 1 | 1 Cor 9:25 |
| with corruptible things | 1 | 1 Pet 1:18 |

### All KJV Occurrences

**Romans 1:23**
> And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like **to corruptible** [phtharto] man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

**1 Corinthians 9:25**
> And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they [do it] to obtain **a corruptible** [phtharton] crown; but we an incorruptible.

**1 Corinthians 15:53**
> For this **corruptible** [phtharton] must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.

**1 Corinthians 15:54**
> So when this **corruptible** [phtharton] shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

**1 Peter 1:18**
> Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed **with corruptible things** [phthartois], [as] silver and gold, from your vain conversation [received] by tradition from your fathers;

**1 Peter 1:23**
> Being born again, not of **corruptible** [phthartou] seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

### Key Observations

1. **Man is `phthartos`; God is `aphthartos` (Rom 1:23):** The verse explicitly contrasts the `aphthartos` (uncorruptible) God with `phthartos` (corruptible) man. This is the most direct NT statement of the contrast between divine incorruptibility and human corruptibility. Man in his present state is the antithesis of what God is.

2. **This corruptible must put on incorruption (1 Cor 15:53):** The demonstrative `touto` ("this") is emphatic — Paul points to the present body (the subject of the whole resurrection discourse) as `phtharton`. This very body, in its current corruptible state, must be transformed.

3. **Corruptible seed vs. incorruptible seed (1 Pet 1:23):** Regeneration comes not from `phtharte spora` (corruptible seed) but from `aphthartou` (incorruptible seed = the word of God). Human generation is `phtharton`; divine regeneration is `aphtharton`. This reinforces that the corruptibility of human nature is not overridden by regeneration but awaits the resurrection transformation.

4. **Corruptible things cannot redeem (1 Pet 1:18):** Silver and gold are `phtharta` (corruptible things) — they cannot purchase redemption because they belong to the decaying order. Only Christ's blood, described as "precious" (1 Pet 1:19), can redeem. The redeemed person's inheritance is `aphtharton` (1 Pet 1:4) — of a different order entirely.

## Summary: The Greek Immortality Word Family

| Word | Strong's | Count | Present human state? | Future gift? | Applied to God? |
|------|----------|-------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| athanasia (immortality) | G110 | 3 | No — to be put on | Yes — at resurrection | Yes — "alone has" (1 Tim 6:16) |
| aphtharsia (incorruption) | G861 | 8 | No — sought (Rom 2:7), brought to light (2 Tim 1:10) | Yes — raised in (1 Cor 15:42) | Indirectly (2 Tim 1:10) |
| aphthartos (incorruptible) | G862 | 7 | No — body is phthartos | Yes — raised incorruptible (1 Cor 15:52) | Yes — uncorruptible God (Rom 1:23; 1 Tim 1:17) |
| thnetos (mortal) | G2349 | 6 | Yes — present body is mortal | N/A | Never |
| phthartos (corruptible) | G5349 | 6 | Yes — present body is corruptible | N/A | Never |

**Theological pattern:** The three positive words (G110, G861, G862) are never applied to the present human condition. They are exclusively applied to: (a) God's nature, (b) the resurrection state, (c) heavenly inheritance. The two negative words (G2349, G5349) are exclusively applied to the present human body. The pattern is consistent: humans are currently mortal and corruptible; at resurrection they receive immortality and incorruption.

## H2416 — חַי (chay) — LIFE / LIVING

**Original:** חַי / חַיִּים (chay / chayyim)
**Transliteration:** chay (singular), chayyim (plural of intensity)
**Pronunciation:** khah-ee
**Part of Speech:** adjective / noun
**Strong's Count:** 528 occurrences

### Definition

Alive; living; life. Derived from the root `H2421` (`chayah`, to live). In noun form as `chayyim` (plural of intensity = "life" in fullness), it denotes life as a quality or possession. The plural form `chayyim` appears in the key compound phrases for the study: "tree of life" (`ets hachayim`) and "everlasting life" (`chayyei olam`).

### Translations (Selected)

Top KJV renderings: "liveth" (61), "living" (38), "of life" (33), "alive" (31), "live" (31)

### Key Study Occurrences

**Genesis 2:7** — `nephesh chayyah` (נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה)
> And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a **living** soul.
- `nephesh chayyah` = "a living soul/being" — man is living by divine breath, not by inherent immortality

**Genesis 2:9** — `ets hachayim` (עֵץ הַחַיִּים)
> And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of **life** also in the midst of the garden...
- The tree of life is the external source from which endless life could be obtained

**Genesis 3:22** — `wachay le-olam` (וָחַי לְעֹלָם)
> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and **live for ever**:
- The exact phrase for immortality in Hebrew: `chay` + `le-olam` = "live to/for eternity"
- God prevents man from gaining this by expelling him from the garden

**Daniel 12:2** — `chayyei olam` (חַיֵּי עֹולָם)
> And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to **everlasting life**, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt.
- `chayyei olam` is the construct chain: "life of eternity" = everlasting life
- This is the OT equivalent of the NT `zoe aionios` (eternal life)
- The LXX translates this as `zoe aionios` — the exact phrase used throughout the NT

### LXX Connection

The LXX (Septuagint) renders `chayyei olam` in Daniel 12:2 as `zoe aionios` — the same expression that appears throughout John's Gospel (John 3:16; 5:24; 6:40,47; 10:28; 17:3) and the rest of the NT. The semantic bridge from Hebrew `chay olam` to Greek `zoe aionios` was established in the LXX translation.

## H5769 — עוֹלָם (ʻôwlâm) — ETERNITY / EVER / EVERLASTING

**Original:** עוֹלָם
**Transliteration:** olam
**Pronunciation:** oh-lawm
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**Strong's Count:** 432 occurrences

### Definition

Properly: "concealed" — the vanishing point of time in either direction. Used to express time out of mind (past or future), eternity, always. Not a philosophical concept of timelessness but a practical expression of "as far as can be conceived" — perpetuity. In the key study phrases, it expresses duration so vast it has no imaginable end.

### Translations (Selected)

Top KJV renderings: "for ever" (198), "ever" (70), "everlasting" (56), "perpetual" (22), "of old" (13)

### Key Study Occurrences

**Genesis 3:22** — `le-olam` (לְעֹלָם)
> ...lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live **for ever** [le-olam]:
- The goal that God prevents: endless duration of life from the tree of life

**Daniel 12:2** — `olam` (twice)
> And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting [olam] life, and some to shame [and] everlasting [olam] contempt.
- Both destinies are characterized by `olam` — both the life and the contempt are endless
- The symmetry reinforces that the resurrection produces two permanent, irreversible outcomes

### Note on `olam` vs. Greek `aionios`

The LXX typically renders `olam` as `aionios` (αἰώνιος, G166). This is the word translated "eternal" or "everlasting" in NT phrases like "eternal life" and "eternal punishment." The theological weight of `olam` (endless duration) carries through into `aionios`. The NT's `zoe aionios` (eternal life) stands on the OT foundation of `chayyei olam`.

## H5315 — נֶפֶשׁ (nephesh) — SOUL / LIVING BEING

**Original:** נֶפֶשׁ
**Transliteration:** nephesh
**Pronunciation:** neh-fesh
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Strong's Count:** 753-780 occurrences (text counts vary slightly by edition)

### Definition

Properly: a breathing creature; animal life; vitality. Used very widely in literal, accommodated, or figurative senses. Not a spiritual substance that inhabits a body but the whole living being — the creature as a living entity. The range of translations in the KJV reflects this breadth: soul, life, person, creature, body, mind, heart, self.

Key semantic range from BDB/Strong's: "any, appetite, beast, body, breath, creature, dead(-ly), desire, fish, ghost, greedy, heart, life, lust, man, me, mind, mortally, one, own, person, pleasure, self, soul, tablet, they, thing, will."

### Translations (Selected)

Top KJV renderings: "my soul" (95), "soul" (43), "thy soul" (42), "his soul" (36), "the souls" (27), "my life" (20), "the soul" (21), "creature" (9), "person" (8), "body" (4), "dead" (2)

Note: "dead" as a translation — `nephesh met` (dead soul/body, Lev 21:11; Num 6:6) — confirms that `nephesh` can describe the dead corpse, not only a living being.

### Key Study Occurrences

**Genesis 2:7** — `nephesh chayyah` (נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה)
> ...and man became a **living soul** [nephesh chayyah].
- Man does not have a soul; man becomes/is a nephesh. The soul is not an immortal component deposited in a body — man himself, as a whole living creature, is the nephesh.
- The same phrase `nephesh chayyah` is used of animals in Gen 1:20,24 — it is not unique to humans.

**Ezekiel 18:4** — `nephesh hamechot'et tamut` (הַנֶּ֣פֶשׁ הַחֹטֵ֥את הִ֖יא תָמֽוּת)
> Behold, all **souls** [nephashoth] are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the **soul** [nephesh] that sinneth, it shall **die** [tamut].
- The nephesh that sins dies. This directly contradicts any doctrine of an inherently immortal soul. The subject of the death sentence is the nephesh itself.
- Cf. Ezekiel 18:20: "The soul that sinneth, it shall die."

**Psalm 49:7-9,15** — nephesh cannot be redeemed by man; God redeems it
> Psalm 49:7: None [of them] can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
> Psalm 49:9: That he should still **live for ever** [chay le-olam], [and] not see corruption.
> Psalm 49:15: But God will redeem my **soul** [nephesh] from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me.
- No man can purchase endless life for his soul (v.7,9); only God can redeem the nephesh from death (v.15).

### LXX Connection

The LXX renders `nephesh` most frequently as `psyche` (ψυχή, Greek "soul"). However, the breadth of `nephesh` is not fully captured by `psyche` — Greek philosophy loaded `psyche` with Platonic associations of an immortal, pre-existent spiritual substance. The Hebrew `nephesh` has no such connotation. This LXX word choice created a terminology bridge that was sometimes misread through Platonic lenses in later Christian thought.

## H4191 — מוּת (mûwth) — TO DIE

**Original:** מוּת
**Transliteration:** muwth
**Pronunciation:** mooth
**Part of Speech:** verb (primitive root)
**Strong's Count:** 1,016 occurrences

### Definition

To die; to be put to death; to kill. A primitive root verb. The causative (Hiphil) form = "to cause to die / to kill." The absolute infinitive construction `moth tamut` (מוֹת תָּמוּת, "dying you shall die") is used in Gen 2:17 for the death penalty — a strong Hebrew idiom for certainty.

### Translations (Selected)

Top KJV renderings: "died" (75), "die" (70), "surely" (49), "shall die" (38), "be put to death" (33), "was dead" (28)

### Key Study Occurrences

**Genesis 2:17** — `moth tamut` (מוֹת תָּמוּת)
> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt **surely die** [moth tamut].
- The absolute infinitive construction emphasizes certainty: "dying you shall die"
- This death sentence is the direct counterpart to Gen 3:22 — man is forbidden the tree of life AND given a death sentence for disobedience. Mortality is the consequence of sin.

**Ezekiel 18:4** — `tamut` (תָמוּת)
> ...the soul [nephesh] that sinneth, it shall **die** [tamut].
- Here the subject of `muwth` is the nephesh — the living being itself dies. Not just the body.

**Hosea 13:14** — context for death being overcome
> I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death [maveth]: O death [maveth], I will be thy plagues; O grave [sheol], I will be thy destruction...
- Quoted in 1 Cor 15:55: "O death, where is thy sting?" — Paul connects the Hosea 13:14 promise to the resurrection victory.

## H4194 — מָוֶת (mâveth) — DEATH

**Original:** מָוֶת
**Transliteration:** maveth
**Pronunciation:** maw-veth
**Part of Speech:** noun (masculine)
**Strong's Count:** 167 occurrences

### Definition

Death (natural or violent); the dead; the place or state of the dead (sheol); figuratively: pestilence, ruin. Derived from `H4191` (`muwth`, to die). As a noun, it names the condition or event of dying.

### Translations (Selected)

Top KJV renderings: "of death" (26), "death" (22), "the death" (20), "from death" (10)

### Key Study Occurrences

**Hosea 13:14** — Death as an enemy to be destroyed
> I will redeem them from **death** [maveth]: O **death** [maveth], I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction...
- Paul applies this text in 1 Cor 15:54-55 to the resurrection victory — death is the last enemy, and its destruction is the eschatological event that coincides with the bestowal of immortality.

**Isaiah 25:8** (LXX/NT connection)
> He will swallow up death [maveth] in victory...
- Directly quoted in 1 Cor 15:54: "then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
- The Hebrew `maveth` becomes the Greek `thanatos` in the LXX — the same word `thanatos` that Paul uses in 1 Cor 15:26 ("last enemy... death") and 2 Tim 1:10 ("abolished death [thanaton]").

### Connection to G2288 (thanatos)

The LXX renders `maveth` as `thanatos` (θάνατος, G2288). The NT vocabulary of death (`thanatos`) stands on the OT foundation of `maveth`. The conquering of `maveth` (Isa 25:8; Hos 13:14) becomes the conquering of `thanatos` (1 Cor 15:26,54-55; 2 Tim 1:10; Rev 20:14).

## Summary: Hebrew Background Words

| Hebrew | Strong's | Core meaning | Role in study |
|--------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| chay / chayyim | H2416 | life / living | Key phrases: "tree of life" (Gen 2:9); "live forever" (Gen 3:22); "everlasting life" (Dan 12:2) |
| olam | H5769 | eternity / forever | Qualifies "life" in the immortality phrases; becomes `aionios` in LXX/NT |
| nephesh | H5315 | living being / soul | Man is a nephesh (Gen 2:7); the nephesh dies (Ezk 18:4); no inherent immortality |
| muwth | H4191 | to die | Man sentenced to die (Gen 2:17); the nephesh that sins dies (Ezk 18:4) |
| maveth | H4194 | death (noun) | The enemy to be swallowed up (Isa 25:8; Hos 13:14); becomes thanatos in NT |

**OT theological pattern:** Man is a nephesh (`H5315`) who lives by divine breath (Gen 2:7). He is sentenced to death (`muwth`, H4191) for sin (Gen 2:17). Access to endless life (`chay le-olam`, H2416+H5769) required the tree of life (Gen 3:22-24), which was cut off. The OT anticipates a future resurrection to `chayyei olam` (Dan 12:2) — but provides no word equivalent to the Greek `athanasia` (deathlessness) as a present human possession. The concept of immortality as a present human endowment is absent from the Hebrew vocabulary of the OT.

### The Immortality Word Map

```
G110  athanasia     = deathlessness    → God alone has it (1 Tim 6:16)
                                         mortal must put it on (1 Cor 15:53)
G861  aphtharsia    = incorruption     → humans seek it (Rom 2:7)
                                         raised in it (1 Cor 15:42)
                                         Christ brought it to light (2 Tim 1:10)
G862  aphthartos    = incorruptible    → God is uncorruptible (Rom 1:23)
                                         dead raised incorruptible (1 Cor 15:52)
G2349 thnetos       = mortal           → present human body (all 6 occurrences)
G5349 phthartos     = corruptible      → present human body (all 6 occurrences)
                                         contrast with God (Rom 1:23)
```

### The Resurrection Transformation

At the resurrection event (1 Cor 15:52-54), four things happen simultaneously:
- `phthartos` (corruptible) → puts on → `aphtharsia` (incorruption) [G5349 → G861]
- `thnetos` (mortal) → puts on → `athanasia` (immortality) [G2349 → G110]
- Dead raised as `aphthartos` (incorruptible) [G862]
- `maveth` / `thanatos` (death) swallowed up in victory [fulfilling Isa 25:8]
