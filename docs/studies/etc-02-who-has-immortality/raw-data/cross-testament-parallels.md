## 1 Timothy 6:16 — hybrid-ot (OT parallels)

Glosses: alone having immortality in light dwelling unapproachable whom has seen no one of men nor...

HYBRID MATCHES:

  Psalmi 136:7           0.385   (age, light)

  Ecclesiastes 1:8       0.351   (able, see)
  Psalmi 136:8           0.349   (age, dominion)

**Observations:** The OT parallels for 1 Tim 6:16 focus on light, sight (no one can see God), eternity, and God's dominion. The unique NT declaration that God "alone has immortality" has no close OT parallel — the OT approaches divine immortality through divine eternity (olam) and light (Psa 36:9; 56:14) but never makes the exclusive "alone" claim with an immortality-specific word.

HYBRID MATCHES:

  GAL 1:5                0.367   (age, amen)

**Observations:** The closest NT parallel is 1 Tim 1:17 (King eternal, immortal, invisible — same letter, same author, same subject). 1 Cor 15:50 connects because it discusses the immortality that must be put on (implying mortals do not yet have it).

HYBRID MATCHES (all weak — no close OT parallel):
  Proverbia 10:30        0.339

  Psalmi 136:4           0.321
  Iob 34:15              0.321

**Observations:** No strong OT parallel for the specific concept of "mortal must put on immortality." The OT resurrection passages (Dan 12:2; Isa 25:8; 26:19) use different vocabulary. This is consistent with the PROMPT.md note that "there is no single Hebrew word equivalent to the Greek athanasia."

  MAT 25:46              0.364   (age, alive)

**Observations:** The NT parallel JHN 3:16 (top NT match) is significant — the tree of life passage in Gen 3:22 parallels John 3:16's theme of everlasting life. Rev 2:7; 22:2,14 (tree of life in paradise) are not among the top 15 but confirm the eschatological restoration. REV 7:3 (tree keyword) confirms.
