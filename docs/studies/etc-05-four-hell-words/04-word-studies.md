## CORE WORDS -- The Four "Hell" Words

### 1. H7585 -- sheol (sheh-ole)

**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** Hades or the world of the dead (as if a subterranean retreat), including its accessories and inmates -- grave, hell, pit
**Total Occurrences:** 67 (65 per BLB)
**Transliteration:** she'owl

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| (to/in/of/the) grave | 31 | 46.3% |
| (of/into/in/to) hell | 27 | 40.3% |
| (into/of) pit | 3 | 4.5% |
| Other (depth, etc.) | 6 | 9.0% |

**Key Observation:** The same Hebrew word is translated "grave" 31 times and "hell" 27 times in KJV. The word itself does not inherently mean a place of punishment -- it is the general abode of the dead, entered by both righteous (Jacob, Gen 37:35; David, Ps 16:10) and wicked (Ps 9:17; Num 16:33).

**LXX Translation (Septuagint):**
H7585 (sheol) is translated by these Greek words in the LXX:
| Greek | Count | PMI Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| G86 hades | 58 | 33.87 | Unseen world, underworld |
| G2609 katago | 10 | 14.59 | To lead down |
| G2597 katabaino | 17 | 13.15 | To descend |
| G2288 thanatos | 14 | 11.98 | Death |
| G684 apoleia | 3 | 5.44 | Ruin, loss, destruction |
| G5590 psyche | 9 | 5.29 | Soul, breath, life |

**Critical Finding:** In 58 of 65+ occurrences, the LXX translators rendered H7585 (sheol) as G86 (hades). This confirms sheol-hades equivalence and demonstrates that both words refer to the same concept: the realm/state of the dead.

### 2. G86 -- hades (hah-dace)

**Part of Speech:** Proper locative noun
**Definition:** From a- (negative particle) and eido (to see); properly "unseen," i.e. Hades -- the unseen world
**Total Occurrences:** 11 (BLB: 11)
**Transliteration:** haides

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| hell / Hell | 8 | 72.7% |
| of hell | 2 | 18.2% |
| O grave | 1 | 9.1% |

**NT Distribution:**
- Matthew: 2 (11:23; 16:18)
- Luke: 2 (10:15; 16:23)
- Acts: 2 (2:27; 2:31) -- both quoting Psalm 16:10
- 1 Corinthians: 1 (15:55)
- Revelation: 4 (1:18; 6:8; 20:13; 20:14)

**Key Observation:** Hades in the NT functions as the Greek equivalent of sheol. Acts 2:27,31 directly quotes Psalm 16:10, substituting hades for sheol, confirming the words are interchangeable. Hades is temporary -- Rev 20:13-14 states it delivers up the dead and is then cast into the lake of fire. It is personified alongside Death (Rev 6:8; 20:13-14).

**Etymology:** From a- (not) + eido (to see) = "the unseen place." The word itself carries no inherent meaning of punishment or torment.

### 3. G1067 -- geenna (gheh-en-nah)

**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** Of Hebrew origin (H1516 gay + H2011 Hinnom); valley of (the son of) Hinnom
**Total Occurrences:** 12 (BLB); 11 in KJV apparatus
**Transliteration:** geenna

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| hell | 9 | 81.8% |
| of hell | 2 | 18.2% |

**NT Distribution (by speaker):**
- Jesus: 11 of 12 occurrences (Matt 5:22,29,30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15,33; Mark 9:43,45,47; Luke 12:5)
- James: 1 occurrence (Jas 3:6)

**Key Observation:** Gehenna is used exclusively by Jesus (11x) and James (1x). It derives from the Valley of Hinnom (ge-Hinnom), a real geographic location southwest of Jerusalem where children were burned in sacrifice to Molech (2 Ki 23:10; Jer 7:31; 32:35). The OT prophets declared it would become the "valley of slaughter" (Jer 7:32; 19:6). Unlike sheol/hades, gehenna is consistently associated with fire and judgment. Matt 10:28 says God is able to "destroy" (apollumi) both soul and body in gehenna. The verb apollumi means to destroy utterly, ruin, lose.

### 4. G5020 -- tartaroo (tar-tar-o-oh)

**Part of Speech:** Verb (not a noun)
**Definition:** From Tartaros (the deepest abyss of Hades); to incarcerate in eternal torment
**Total Occurrences:** 1
**Transliteration:** tartaroo

**The Single Occurrence:**
2 Peter 2:4 -- "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell [tartaroo], and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment."

**Key Observation:** Tartaroo is a verb (to cast into Tartarus), not a noun designating a place. It is used only once and applied only to fallen angels, never to human beings. Tartarus was a Greek mythological term for the deepest part of the underworld. Peter appropriates the term to describe the confinement of angels awaiting judgment -- it is a holding place, not a final destination. Jude 1:6 provides a parallel: "reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."

## BACKGROUND WORDS -- Gehenna Origin

### 5. H1516 -- gay (gah-ee)

**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun (also masculine)
**Definition:** Probably by transmutation from the same root as ge'a (abbreviated); a gorge (from its lofty sides; hence narrow, but not a gully or winter-torrent) -- valley
**Total Occurrences:** 67 (60 per BLB)
**Transliteration:** gay'

Used in combination with H2011 (Hinnom) to form the geographic name "Valley of Hinnom" -- the source for the Greek word gehenna. Occurs in Joshua 15:8; 18:16 (boundary marker), 2 Kings 23:10, 2 Chronicles 28:3; 33:6, Jeremiah 7:31,32; 19:2,6; 32:35, Nehemiah 11:30.

---

### 6. H2011 -- Hinnom (hin-nome)

**Part of Speech:** Proper locative noun
**Definition:** Probably of foreign origin; Hinnom, apparently a Jebusite
**Total Occurrences:** 13
**Transliteration:** Hinnom

**All 13 occurrences refer to the Valley of Hinnom:**
- Joshua 15:8 (3x); 18:16 (4x) -- Geographic boundary descriptions
- 2 Kings 23:10 (2x) -- Josiah defiles Topheth
- 2 Chronicles 28:3 (2x) -- Ahaz burns children there
- 2 Chronicles 33:6 (2x) -- Manasseh burns children there
- Nehemiah 11:30 -- Settlement boundary
- *Isaiah 66:24, Jeremiah 7:31,32; 19:2,6; 32:35 -- per BLB/lexicon*

**Key Observation:** Every OT occurrence of Hinnom is geographic or cultic. The valley was (1) a real place, (2) associated with child sacrifice to Molech, and (3) prophetically declared a place of destruction/slaughter by Jeremiah. This geographic-historical reality is the foundation for Jesus' use of "gehenna" as an image of final judgment.

## SUPPORTING WORDS -- Torment/Punishment Vocabulary

### 7. G929 -- basanismos (bas-an-is-mos)

**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** From G928 (basanizo); torture -- torment
**Total Occurrences:** 6
**Transliteration:** basanismos

**All occurrences:**
- Revelation 9:5 (2x) -- torment of locusts
- Revelation 14:11 -- smoke of their torment ascends
- Revelation 18:7 -- torment and sorrow of Babylon
- Revelation 18:10 -- the hour of Babylon's judgment/torment
- Revelation 18:15 -- merchants stand afar for fear of her torment

**Key Observation:** 5 of 6 occurrences are in Revelation. Of these, 3 refer to the destruction of Babylon (a symbolic entity), and 1 to the plague of locusts. Only Rev 14:11 directly concerns final judgment of idolaters, and notably the smoke (not the torment itself) is what "ascends forever."

---

### 8. G928 -- basanizo (bas-an-id-zo)

**Part of Speech:** Verb
**Definition:** From G931 (basanos = a touchstone); to torture -- pain, toil, torment, toss, vex
**Total Occurrences:** 12
**Transliteration:** basanizo

**Notable occurrences:**
- Matt 8:6 -- servant "grievously tormented" (sick)
- Matt 8:29 -- demons ask "art thou come to torment us before the time?"
- Matt 14:24 -- ship "tossed" with waves (same word)
- Mark 5:7; Luke 8:28 -- demons plead not to be tormented
- 2 Pet 2:8 -- Lot "vexed" his righteous soul
- Rev 9:5 -- tormented as a scorpion stings
- Rev 11:10 -- two prophets "tormented" those on earth
- Rev 12:2 -- woman "pained" in childbirth
- Rev 14:10 -- "tormented with fire and brimstone"
- Rev 20:10 -- devil, beast, false prophet "tormented day and night for ever and ever"

**Key Observation:** The word basanizo has a wide semantic range: it is used for sickness (Matt 8:6), waves tossing a boat (Matt 14:24), moral distress (2 Pet 2:8), and childbirth pain (Rev 12:2), in addition to punishment contexts. Rev 20:10 applies it to the devil, beast, and false prophet -- these are symbolic entities, not individual humans.

### 9. G2851 -- kolasis (kol-as-is)

**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** From G2849 (kolazo); penal infliction -- punishment, torment
**Total Occurrences:** 2 (BLB; 1 in KJV text)
**Transliteration:** kolasis

**Occurrences:**
- Matthew 25:46 -- "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment" (kolasis aionios)
- 1 John 4:18 -- "Fear hath torment" (kolasis)

**Key Observation:** Kolasis occurs only twice in the NT. In classical Greek, kolasis originally meant "pruning" or "corrective punishment" (distinct from timoria, retributive punishment). In Matt 25:46, it is paired with aionios. The meaning depends on whether aionios means "eternal" in the sense of duration or "age-long" / "pertaining to the age to come."

---

### 10. G4663 -- skolex (sko-lakes)

**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**Definition:** Of uncertain derivation; a grub, maggot or earth-worm -- worm
**Total Occurrences:** 3
**Transliteration:** skolex

**All occurrences:**
- Mark 9:44 -- "Where their worm dieth not"
- Mark 9:46 -- "Where their worm dieth not"
- Mark 9:48 -- "Where their worm dieth not"

**Key Observation:** All three occurrences are in Jesus' gehenna warning, quoting Isaiah 66:24. In the Isaiah source, the worm feeds on "carcases" (dead bodies, Hebrew peger), not living beings. The worm and fire in Isaiah 66:24 are instruments of consumption/decomposition of the dead, not agents of ongoing torment of the living. The skolex is a physical maggot, not a spiritual entity.

---

### 11. H7496 -- rapha (raw-faw)

**Part of Speech:** Masculine plural noun
**Definition:** From rapha in the sense of rapha; properly lax, i.e. (figuratively) a ghost (as dead; in plural only) -- dead, deceased
**Total Occurrences:** 8
**Transliteration:** rapha (rephaim)

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count |
|---|---|
| the dead | 5 |
| Dead | 1 |
| of the dead | 1 |
| deceased | 1 |

**Key occurrences with sheol:**
- Job 26:5 -- "Dead things [rephaim] are formed from under the waters"
- Psalm 88:10 (per lexicon) -- referenced among sheol passages
- Proverbs 2:18; 9:18; 21:16 -- "the dead" / depths of sheol
- Isaiah 14:9 -- "Hell from beneath is moved for thee... it stirreth up the dead [rephaim]"
- Isaiah 26:14 -- "The dead [rephaim] shall not live; the deceased shall not rise"
- Isaiah 26:19 -- "Thy dead men shall live... awake and sing"

**Key Observation:** Rephaim are the "shades" or inhabitants of sheol. In Isaiah 14:9, the rephaim are "stirred up" at the arrival of the king of Babylon -- but this is highly poetic/taunt language (see Isa 14:4 "thou shalt take up this proverb"). In Isaiah 26:14, the rephaim "shall not live" and "shall not rise" -- contradicting any idea of conscious activity. The term describes the dead as powerless, inactive shades.

---

### 12. G3041 -- limne (lim-nay)

**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Definition:** Probably from G3040 (limen, a harbor); a pond (large or small) -- lake
**Total Occurrences:** 10
**Transliteration:** limne

All 10 occurrences are in the NT:
- Luke 5:1,2; 8:22,23,33 -- Lake of Gennesaret / lake (geographic)
- Revelation 19:20; 20:10,14,15; 21:8 -- "lake of fire"

**Key Observation:** In its 5 Revelation occurrences, limne (lake) is combined with pur (fire) to form "the lake of fire" -- a term that appears only in Revelation. The lake of fire is explicitly identified as "the second death" (Rev 20:14; 21:8). It is distinct from hades -- hades itself is cast into the lake of fire (Rev 20:14). The lake of fire receives: (1) the beast and false prophet (Rev 19:20), (2) the devil (Rev 20:10), (3) death and hades (Rev 20:14), (4) those not in the book of life (Rev 20:15), (5) the wicked categories of Rev 21:8.

## G166 -- aionios (ahee-o-nee-os)

**Note:** This word was studied in detail in etc-03. It is the adjective used in "everlasting punishment" (Matt 25:46), "everlasting fire" (Matt 18:8; 25:41), "eternal damnation" (Mark 3:29), and "everlasting destruction" (2 Thess 1:9). Its meaning ("eternal," "age-long," "pertaining to the age") is a critical interpretive question for this study.
