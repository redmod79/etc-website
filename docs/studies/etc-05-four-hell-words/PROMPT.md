| ᾅδης (haidēs) | G86 | 58 | 33.87 | Hades, unseen world |
| κατάγω (katagō) | G2609 | 10 | 14.59 | to lead down |
| καταβαίνω (katabainō) | G2597 | 17 | 13.15 | to descend |
| θάνατος (thanatos) | G2288 | 14 | 11.98 | death |
| γῆρας (gēras) | G1094 | 3 | 7.79 | old age |
| ὠδίν (ōdin) | G5604 | 3 | 7.23 | a pang, throe |

| ψυχή (psychē) | G5590 | 9 | 5.29 | breath, soul |

**Key finding:** The LXX overwhelmingly translates sheol as hades (58 of ~65 instances), confirming semantic equivalence. The next most common translations involve descending/going down vocabulary, death, and destruction -- none involve torment vocabulary.

#### Hebrew Source Words for G86 (Hades)
| Hebrew Word | Strong's | Count | Score | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|---------|
| שְׁאוֹל (shᵉ'owl) | H7585 | 58 | 33.87 | Sheol, grave, pit |
| יָרַד (yarad) | H3381 | 27 | 15.89 | to descend |

**Key finding:** G86 (hades) maps to H7585 (sheol) as its primary Hebrew source (58 instances, score 33.87 -- by far the dominant mapping). The associated vocabulary is descending, death, pit, shades (the deceased), lowest -- consistent with the unseen abode of all the dead, not specifically a place of torment.

### Focus Areas
(Derived from tool discoveries and prior study gaps)

1. **Sheol (H7585) -- Comprehensive semantic range:** All ~67 OT occurrences. KJV translates this single word as "hell," "grave," and "pit." RV introduced "Sheol" in many places. What does the translation pattern reveal? Who goes to sheol (righteous, wicked, or both)? What is described happening there? Is sheol EVER described as a place of torment in a didactic context? Prior study etc-04 already established sheol = unconsciousness, silence, darkness, no knowledge (N019). This study examines the WORD itself exhaustively.

2. **Hades (G86) -- All 11 NT occurrences:** The LXX translates sheol as hades in 58 of ~65 instances. Acts 2:27,31 directly demonstrates this equivalence (Peter quoting Ps 16:10). How does hades function in each NT passage? Special attention to Luke 16:23 (only hades text with torment -- already classified parabolic/Neutral in etc-04), Rev 20:13-14 (hades cast into lake of fire -- already noted as N020), Rev 1:18 (keys of hades and death), Matt 16:18 (gates of hades).

3. **Gehenna (G1067) -- All 12 NT occurrences and OT background:** Derived from Hebrew ge-hinnom (Valley of Hinnom). OT: site of child sacrifice (2 Ki 23:10; 2 Chr 28:3; 33:6; Jer 7:31; 32:35), prophetically cursed (Jer 7:32; 19:6). How does Jesus use gehenna? He says God can "destroy both soul and body in gehenna" (Matt 10:28 -- already E028). Mark 9:43-48 quotes Isa 66:24 (corpses, not living beings). Does gehenna vocabulary point to destruction or to ongoing torment?

4. **Tartaroo (G5020) -- 2 Peter 2:4:** Only NT occurrence. Applied to angels, not humans. Parallel in Jude 1:6. What is the relationship to Greek mythology? Does Peter borrow the term deliberately?

5. **Interchangeability question:** The KJV translates sheol, hades, gehenna, and tartaroo ALL as "hell." Are they interchangeable or do they describe different concepts? The evidence from prior studies and Strong's data suggests distinct concepts: sheol/hades = general abode of all dead (temporary); gehenna = eschatological fire/destruction (final); tartaroo = angel imprisonment.

6. **Does any word inherently mean eternal torment?** Examine the lexical definition, LXX patterns, OT background, and actual usage of each word. Strong's definition of G5020 includes "eternal torment" language -- is this definition derived from the text or from theological tradition?

7. **LXX translation patterns:** The LXX translates sheol as hades 58 times. The associated vocabulary is descending, death, pit, destruction, shades -- NOT torment. Does the LXX evidence support the idea that sheol/hades means "place of torment"?

8. **Rev 20:13-14 -- Hades cast into the lake of fire:** Hades and the lake of fire are demonstrably distinct (one is cast INTO the other). What does this mean for the claim that "hades = hell = eternal torment"?

9. **Isaiah 66:24 and Mark 9:48:** "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." Isaiah 66:24 describes CORPSES ("carcases of the men that have transgressed against me"). Jesus quotes this in a gehenna context. Does the OT source point to ongoing torment of conscious beings or to the unquenchable destruction of the dead?

### Specific Research Questions to Answer
1. In how many of sheol's ~67 occurrences does the context describe torment or punishment? (vs. how many describe silence, darkness, unconsciousness, or simply the destination of all who die)
2. How many of hades' 11 NT occurrences describe conscious torment? (Answer from etc-04: only Luke 16:23, which is parabolic)
3. In gehenna passages, what does Jesus say happens to people? (Destroy: Matt 10:28. Fire: Matt 5:22; 18:9; Mark 9:43-48. Cast in: Luke 12:5. "Of hell": Matt 23:15,33. Tongue set on fire: Jas 3:6)
4. What is the OT background of gehenna in the Valley of Hinnom?
5. Is tartaroo ever applied to humans?
6. What does the LXX translation pattern (sheol -> hades 58x) tell us about the semantic range?
7. How does the KJV's uniform translation of all four words as "hell" obscure their distinct meanings?

### INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY
```
INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by ECT proponents, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by conditionalists, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says. Do not use editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," "honestly acknowledge," or "non-intuitive reading." Simply state what each passage says and what each side infers from it.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- Never use language like "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.
```

### Evidence Classification Requirements
Follow the full methodology in `D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-series-methodology.md`:
- Trees 1-5 for classification
- Tree 3 for every E-item classified as Conditionalist or ECT (full 4-gate documentation)
- N-tier 3-question test for every N-item
- I-B resolution protocol for every I-B inference
- Read and update `D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-master-evidence.md` before writing tally
- What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said sections
