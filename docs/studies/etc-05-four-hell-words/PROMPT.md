# Bible Study: The Four "Hell" Words — Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, and Tartaroo

## Question

English Bibles translate several different words as "hell." What are the original Hebrew and Greek words? Examine sheol (H7585), hades (G86), gehenna (G1067), and tartaroo (G5020). What is the semantic range of each? Are they interchangeable? Do any of them inherently mean a place of eternal conscious torment?

#### Key Findings from Prior etc5 Studies (series context only)

**From etc5-01 (What Is Man?):**
- Man was formed from dust + breath and *became* a living soul (nephesh); at death this process reverses — dust to earth, breath to God (E1, E12, N4). The soul (nephesh/psyche) can die and is not inherently indestructible (E24, E26, N7, N8).
- God alone currently possesses immortality (athanasia) — 1 Tim 6:16 uses the exclusive monos (E29, N5). Mortals must put on immortality at the resurrection (E31, N6).
- The state of the dead is described as unconscious across multiple independent authors: "The dead know not any thing" (Ecc 9:5); "thoughts perish that very day" (Psa 146:4); "man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more" (Job 14:12) — all classified as Plain didactic statements (E17, E13, E20).
- IB001 (conscious intermediate state) was Unresolved after etc5-01.

**From etc5-02 (Who Has Immortality?):**
- The three NT positive immortality words (athanasia G110, aphtharsia G861, aphthartos G862) are NEVER applied to any present human being in any NT text (N16). The deathless state ("cannot die any more") is explicitly post-resurrection per Luk 20:35-36 (E82).
- Eternal life is in the Son; those without the Son do not have life (1 Jn 5:11-12, N17).
- IB001 remained Unresolved.

**From etc5-03 (Biblical Death):**
- The second death IS the lake of fire, by explicit textual identification: Rev 20:14; 21:8 (E110, E113, N21). Hades is distinct from the lake of fire — hades is cast INTO it (N21). Three death registers identified: physical, spiritual, and second death (IA012).
- IA013: Second death = actual death (final destruction) is classified I-A (evidence-extending), systematizing apollymi (destroy/perish), "second death," and the death/life antithesis pattern. This remains the best-supported inference about the second death's nature.
- Rich Man and Lazarus (Luk 16) classified IB006 — Unresolved (genre question).
- IB001 (conscious intermediate state): still Unresolved as of etc5-03.

**From etc5-04 (State of the Dead):**
- IB001 SHIFTED from Unresolved to MODERATE (weight against conscious intermediate state). New evidence: E128 (1 Cor 15:18: without resurrection = perished; same author as Phil 1:23); E130-E131 (Acts 2:29,31: David dead and buried; Christ's soul in hades until resurrection); Rev 20:5 framework (N025: dead are "not living" between death and resurrection); N026 (hades = temporary holding state that delivers up the dead and is then abolished).
- Hades was confirmed as a temporary holding state for all the dead — the model: hades receives → holds until resurrection → delivers up → hades itself destroyed (N026).
- Acts 7:59-60 (IA015): spirit-commendation followed immediately by "fell asleep" in the same Lukan narrative — weight against conscious intermediate state.
- Ecc 9:5 ("dead know not any thing") confirmed plain and unqualified by Hebrew morphological analysis (IB002 confirmed: Moderate against the "under the sun" qualifier).

**Series-level foundation for this study:**
The accumulated evidence from etc5-01 through etc5-04 establishes:
1. Sheol/hades is already heavily defined from the conditionalist framework: it is a temporary state of unconscious waiting, receiving all the dead, from which God resurrects. The prior series confirms hades = sheol (LXX data + NT quotations of OT).
2. The second death (lake of fire) is death in the fullest sense — the complete destruction of the whole person — supported by IA013 from etc5-03.
3. The conscious intermediate state question (IB001) has shifted to Moderate against, with David confirmed in hades at Pentecost (Acts 2:29-31) — making it clear that OT saints were in hades, not in conscious paradise, before the resurrection.

### Focus Areas

Derived from tool discoveries (Nave's entries, Strong's lookups, LXX mapping, etc5 series context):

1. **Semantic analysis of H7585 (sheol) — all 67 occurrences must be covered.** The KJV translates the same word as both "grave" and "hell" depending on context (E30 from etc4). The 25 unique KJV translations of H7585 reveal the word's actual semantic range. The LXX equates sheol with hades in 58 of its occurrences (by far the strongest PMI score). Research must cover all 67 occurrences organized by category: (a) righteous in sheol, (b) wicked in sheol, (c) descriptive passages about conditions in sheol, (d) rescue/redemption from sheol.

2. **Semantic analysis of G86 (hades) — all 11 occurrences must be covered.** Critical texts: Acts 2:27,31 (the sheol-hades equivalence via LXX quotation of Ps 16:10); Rev 20:13-14 (hades delivers up dead and is cast into the lake of fire); Rev 1:18 (Christ holds the keys of hades and death); 1 Cor 15:55 (quoting Hos 13:14 — sheol = hades). The Rich Man and Lazarus (Luk 16:23) must be examined with genre awareness per IB006 classification from etc5-03.

3. **Semantic analysis of G1067 (gehenna) — all 12 occurrences must be covered.** The OT background (gê Hinnôm, Valley of Hinnom, H1516+H2011) is essential: the valley's history of child sacrifice (2 Ki 23:10; Jer 7:31-32) and Josiah's defilement of it, leading to its becoming a burning garbage dump. Isaiah 66:24 ("carcases… worm shall not die, fire not quenched") is the primary OT source text Jesus quotes (Mk 9:43-48). The word apollymi (G622, "destroy/perish") in Mat 10:28 is critical for the debate about whether gehenna involves destruction or ongoing torment.

4. **Semantic analysis of G5020 (tartaroo) — the single occurrence at 2 Pet 2:4.** This is a verbal hapax legomenon (verb form of Tartaros, the deepest abyss). Must examine: (a) subjects = angels only, not humans; (b) state = temporary confinement "reserved unto judgment"; (c) Jude 1:6 as the parallel text. Compare with G12 (abyssos/bottomless pit) in Revelation where the abyss also holds demonic entities.

5. **H7496 (rephaim) — the inhabitants of sheol.** These "shades" or "dead ones" (always plural) appear in texts that describe sheol's population: Job 26:5 (dead things formed under the waters); Psa 88:11; Isa 14:9 (rephaim stirred up to meet the king of Babylon in sheol); Isa 26:14,19 (rephaim who will not rise vs. God's dead who will arise). Critical for understanding whether sheol's inhabitants have any form of activity.

6. **H6757 (tsalmaveth) — shadow of death.** 18 occurrences; key texts include Psa 23:4; Psa 107:10,14; Isa 9:1-2; Job 10:21-22; 38:17. This term functions as a synonym-parallel to sheol in the poetic literature, reinforcing sheol's character as darkness and death.

7. **The critical distinction between hades and the lake of fire.** Rev 20:13-14 explicitly distinguishes them: hades delivers up the dead and is then cast into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is identified as "the second death" (Rev 20:14; 21:8). This is N21 from etc5-03 and must be carried forward and deepened.

8. **The eternal-fire / unquenchable-fire question.** Mat 25:41 ("everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels"); Mk 9:43 ("fire that never shall be quenched"); Isa 66:24 (worm/fire OT source). The biblical example explicitly called an "ensample of eternal fire" (Sodom — Jude 1:7) was reduced to ashes (2 Pet 2:6). This N10 from etc4 must be freshly confirmed with tool-retrieved verse texts.

9. **The aionion kolasin (everlasting/age-during punishment) question from Mat 25:46.** The same adjective aionion modifies both "punishment" and "life." The research must examine: (a) the semantic range of aionios; (b) whether it modifies the process or the result of punishment; (c) how the same term is used elsewhere in Matthew and the NT.

10. **The question of interchangeability.** The research must directly answer: sheol ≠ gehenna (sheol is temporary and receives all the dead; gehenna is the final judgment state for the wicked); hades = sheol (LXX translation + NT quotation prove this); tartaroo is categorically distinct (angels only, pre-judgment, single occurrence). The "hell" translation in KJV conflates all four into a single English word.

### Important Context from Prior etc5 Studies (for the analysis agent)

The analysis agent must integrate findings from etc5-01 through etc5-04. Key established evidence relevant to this study:

| Master Evidence ID | Statement | Classification |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| E017 | "The dead know not any thing" — Ecc 9:5 | Conditionalist (Plain) |
| E019 | "No work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave [sheol]" — Ecc 9:10 | Conditionalist (Plain) |
| E026 | God "is able to destroy both soul and body in hell [gehenna]" — Mat 10:28 | Conditionalist (Plain) |

| E134 | "Death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them" — Rev 20:13 | Conditionalist (Plain) |
| N021 | The second death IS the lake of fire (explicit textual identification) | Conditionalist (N-tier) |
| N026 | Hades is a temporary holding state: receives → holds → delivers up → is destroyed | Conditionalist (N-tier) |
| IA013 | Second death = actual death (final irreversible destruction) | I-A (Evidence-Extending) |
| IB001 | Conscious intermediate state for the righteous | Moderate — weight AGAINST (as of etc5-04) |
| IB006 | Rich Man and Lazarus as literal hades description | I-B Unresolved |

## Related Studies in This Series

This study builds on the following etc5 foundation studies:

| Study | Key Findings Relevant Here |
|-------|---------------------------|
| etc5-01-what-is-man | Man became a nephesh (whole person); soul can die (E24, N7); God alone has immortality (E29, N5); state of the dead = unconscious (IA005); death = reversal of creation formula (N4) |
| etc5-02-who-has-immortality | Positive immortality words never applied to present human state (N016); deathless state is post-resurrection only (E082); eternal life is in the Son (N017) |
| etc5-03-biblical-death | Second death IS the lake of fire (N021); hades is distinct from the lake of fire (N021); second death = actual death/destruction supported as I-A (IA013); death/life are ontological antitheses throughout Paul and John (IA014) |
| etc5-04-state-of-the-dead | Hades confirmed as temporary holding state (N026); IB001 shifted to Moderate weight against conscious intermediate state; David confirmed in hades at Pentecost (E130, E131); spirit-commendation followed by sleep in Luke's narrative (IA015) |
