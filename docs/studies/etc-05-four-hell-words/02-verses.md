## Question

English Bibles translate several different words as "hell." What are the original Hebrew and Greek words? Examine sheol (H7585), hades (G86), gehenna (G1067), and tartaroo (G5020). What is the semantic range of each? Are they interchangeable? Do any of them inherently mean a place of eternal conscious torment?

## Primary Verses

### Part A — All Hades Occurrences (G86 — 11 verses)

#### Matthew 11:23 [hades — city judgment]

**Context (Matt 11:20-24):**
> 11:20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:
> 11:21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
> 11:22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
> **11:23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.**
> 11:24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

**Note:** "Hell" = G86 (hades). Used as a contrast to heaven — brought DOWN to hades. Judgment language; not a description of the internal state of hades.

#### Matthew 16:18 [hades — gates shall not prevail]

**Context (Matt 16:15-20):**
> 16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
> 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
> 16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed [it] unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
> **16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.**
> 16:19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

**Note:** "Gates of hell" = pulai tou hadou — the gates of hades (the realm of death). The church cannot be overcome by death/the grave. This is about death's power, not punishment.

---

#### Luke 10:15 [hades — Capernaum parallel to Matt 11:23]

**Context (Luke 10:12-16):**
> 10:12 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
> 10:13 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
> 10:14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.
> **10:15 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.**
> 10:16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.

**Note:** Synoptic parallel to Matt 11:23. Same hades usage — judgment language.

#### Luke 16:23 [hades — Rich Man and Lazarus]

**Context (Luke 16:19-31 — full passage):**
> 16:19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
> 16:20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
> 16:21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
> 16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
> **16:23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.**
> 16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
> 16:25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
> 16:26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.
> 16:27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
> 16:28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
> 16:29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
> 16:30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
> 16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

**Note:** "Hell" = G86 (hades). This is the ONLY NT passage where hades is described from inside with conscious experience. IB006 from etc5-03 classified this as Unresolved (genre question — parable or literal). Genre markers: hyperbolic details, parabolic structure (like other Lucan parables), teaching purpose about hearing Moses and the prophets.

#### Acts 2:27 and 2:31 [hades — Peter's Pentecost sermon, quoting Ps 16:10]

**Context (Acts 2:22-36):**
> 2:22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:
> 2:23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:
> 2:24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
> 2:25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
> 2:26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
> **2:27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.**
> 2:28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
> 2:29 Men [and] brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
> 2:30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;
> **2:31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.**
> 2:32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
> 2:33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
> 2:34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
> 2:35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
> 2:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.

**Note:** CRITICAL PASSAGE. Peter quotes Psalm 16:10 (LXX: "sheol" → G86 hades). The quotation PROVES the LXX equation: sheol of Ps 16:10 = hades in Acts 2:27,31. Christ's soul was IN hades between death and resurrection; it was NOT left there. David "is both dead and buried" (v.29) — confirming OT saints go to hades (not conscious paradise before resurrection).

#### 1 Corinthians 15:55 [hades — quoting Hosea 13:14]

**Context (1 Cor 15:50-57):**
> 15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
> 15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
> 15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
> 15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.
> 15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
> **15:55 O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory?**
> 15:56 The sting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law.
> 15:57 But thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

**Note:** "Grave" = G86 (hades). Paul quotes Hosea 13:14 (LXX). "O grave/hades" = sheol in Hosea. The KJV translates G86 as "grave" here — confirming that even the KJV recognized hades = grave (sheol), not a place of torment, in this context.

**Cross-reference (Hosea 13:14):**
> I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.

---

#### Revelation 1:18 [hades — Christ holds the keys]

**Context (Rev 1:13-19):**
> 1:13-16 [Vision of the glorified Christ]
> 1:17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
> **1:18 [I am] he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.**
> 1:19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;

**Note:** "Hell" = G86 (hades). Death and hades are paired as a hendiadys — the twin powers of death. Christ "was dead" and entered hades; now he holds the keys — he has authority over death and the realm of the dead. Consistent with N026 (hades as temporary holding state).

---

#### Revelation 6:8 [hades — the pale horse]

**Context (Rev 6:5-11):**
> 6:7 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.
> **6:8 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.**
> 6:9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:

**Note:** "Hell" = G86 (hades). Death and hades are personified as a pair — Death kills, Hades follows to receive the dead. This confirms hades is the receiving state for those who die.

---

#### Revelation 20:13 [hades — delivers up the dead]

> **20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.**

**Note:** "Hell" = G86 (hades). Hades DELIVERS UP the dead — it gives them back for judgment. This is the key verse establishing hades as a TEMPORARY holding state. After delivering up the dead, hades is then destroyed (v.14).

---

#### Revelation 20:14 [hades — cast into the lake of fire]

**Context (Rev 20:11-15):**
> 20:11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
> 20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
> 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
> **20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.**
> 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

**Note:** CRITICAL PASSAGE. Hades is CAST INTO the lake of fire and thereby DESTROYED. "This is the second death" = explicit identification: the lake of fire = the second death. Hades is distinct from the lake of fire; hades ends when cast into it. This is E110/N026 from prior etc5 studies.

### Part B — All Gehenna Occurrences (G1067 — 12 verses)

#### Matthew 5:22 [gehenna — anger/hell fire]

**Context (Matt 5:20-26):**
> 5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
> 5:21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
> **5:22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.**
> 5:23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;

**Note:** "Hell fire" = geennan tou puros (gehenna of fire). Escalating language: judgment → council → gehenna. Gehenna = final condemnation.

---

#### Matthew 5:29 [gehenna — pluck out the eye]

> **5:29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.**

**Note:** "Hell" = G1067 (gehenna). "Body cast into gehenna" — physical language. The body is destroyed, not tortured continuously.

---

#### Matthew 5:30 [gehenna — cut off the hand]

> **5:30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.**

**Note:** "Hell" = G1067 (gehenna). Parallel to v.29 — the body is "cast into gehenna."

---

#### Matthew 10:28 [gehenna — fear him who destroys body and soul]

**Context (Matt 10:24-31):**
> 10:24 The disciple is not above [his] master, nor the servant above his lord.
> 10:26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
> 10:27 What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, [that] preach ye upon the housetops.
> **10:28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.**
> 10:29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
> 10:30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

**Note:** CRITICAL PASSAGE. "Hell" = G1067 (gehenna). The Greek verb is ἀπολέσαι (apollesai, G622 ἀπόλλυμι) = Aorist Active Infinitive of "to destroy/perish." God DESTROYS both soul AND body in gehenna. This is E026 from prior etc5 studies — a plain, unqualified statement about the nature of gehenna's effect.

---

#### Matthew 18:9 [gehenna — two eyes / hell fire]

**Context (Matt 18:7-10):**
> 18:7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
> 18:8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast [them] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
> **18:9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.**
> 18:10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.

**Note:** "Hell fire" = G1067 (gehenna of fire). v.8 calls it "everlasting fire" (pyr to aionion); v.9 calls it "hell fire" (gehenna of fire) — used interchangeably in the same pericope.

---

#### Matthew 23:15 [gehenna — child of hell]

**Context (Matt 23:13-16):**
> 23:13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in [yourselves], neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
> 23:14 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
> **23:15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.**

**Note:** "Child of hell" = huion geennēs (son of gehenna). Idiomatic — "son of" means "one destined for" or "characterized by." The proselyte is doubly destined for gehenna.

---

#### Matthew 23:33 [gehenna — damnation of hell]

**Context (Matt 23:29-35):**
> 23:29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,
> 23:31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.
> 23:32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
> **23:33 [Ye] serpents, [ye] generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?**
> 23:34 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and [some] of them ye shall kill and crucify; and [some] of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute [them] from city to city:

**Note:** "Damnation of hell" = krisis geennēs (judgment of gehenna). The scribes and Pharisees cannot escape gehenna's judgment. Strong condemnation language.

---

#### Mark 9:43 [gehenna — cut off hand / fire never quenched]

**Context (Mark 9:42-49 — full gehenna section):**
> 9:42 And whosoever shall offend one of [these] little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
> **9:43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:**
> **9:44 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.**
> **9:45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:**
> **9:46 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.**
> **9:47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:**
> **9:48 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.**
> 9:49 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.

**Note:** CRITICAL PASSAGE. "Hell" = G1067 (gehenna) in vv.43, 45, 47. The refrain "their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" (vv.44,46,48) quotes Isaiah 66:24 directly. In Isaiah, the worm and fire refer to CORPSES — not conscious souls. The "never quenched" fire = a fire that burns to completion without being prematurely extinguished.

---

#### Mark 9:45 [gehenna — cut off foot]

> **9:45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:**

*(See full context under Mark 9:43 above)*

---

#### Mark 9:47 [gehenna — pluck out eye]

> **9:47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:**

*(See full context under Mark 9:43 above)*

---

#### Luke 12:5 [gehenna — whom to fear]

**Context (Luke 12:1-7):**
> 12:1 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
> 12:2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
> 12:4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
> **12:5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.**
> 12:6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
> 12:7 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

**Note:** "Hell" = G1067 (gehenna). Synoptic parallel to Matt 10:28. "After he hath killed hath power to cast into hell" — the sequence is kill (bodily death), then cast into gehenna. The power over gehenna extends BEYOND physical death.

---

#### James 3:6 [gehenna — the tongue set on fire]

**Context (Jas 3:1-8):**
> 3:5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
> **3:6 And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.**
> 3:7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
> 3:8 But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.

**Note:** "Hell" = G1067 (gehenna). James uses gehenna figuratively — the tongue's destructive power is like the fire of gehenna. This is the only non-Jesus use of gehenna in the NT. Used metaphorically; confirms gehenna was understood as consuming, destructive fire.

---

### Part C — Tartaroo (G5020 — 1 verse + Jude 1:6 parallel)

#### 2 Peter 2:4 [tartaroo — angels cast to the deep]

**Context (2 Peter 2:1-9):**
> 2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
> 2:2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
> 2:3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.
> **2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;**
> 2:5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person], a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
> **2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;**
> 2:7 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:
> 2:8 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds;)
> 2:9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:

**Note:** CRITICAL PASSAGE. "Hell" = G5020 (tartaroo/tartarosas) — Aorist Active Participle. The verb form ταρταρώσας = "having cast down to Tartarus." Key features:
- Subjects = ANGELS only, not humans
- State = "chains of darkness" (seirois zophou)
- Purpose = TEMPORARY: "reserved unto judgment" (eis krisin teroumenous)
- Sodom's fate (v.6) = "turning into ashes" — cf. Jude 1:7's "eternal fire" resulted in ashes

---

#### Jude 1:6-7 [tartaroo parallel + eternal fire = Sodom]

**Full Jude passage (1:4-13):**
> 1:4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
> 1:5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
> **1:6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.**
> **1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.**
> 1:8 Likewise also these [filthy] dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
> 1:9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
> 1:12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds [they are] without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
> 1:13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.

**Note:** CRITICAL PASSAGE — Jude 1:7:
- Sodom and Gomorrah suffer "the vengeance of eternal fire" (puros aioniou)
- 2 Pet 2:6 describes the SAME event: "turning the cities... into ashes"
- Therefore: "eternal fire" = a fire whose RESULT is eternal (permanent destruction), not a fire that burns eternally
- This is the biblical example explicitly called "eternal fire" — and it reduced cities to ashes

**Jude 1:6** parallels 2 Pet 2:4:
- Same angels, same state of confinement
- "Everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day"
- Confirms: angels in Tartaroo are PRE-JUDGMENT, not in final punishment

---

### Part D — Key Sheol Passages (H7585)

#### Genesis 37:35 [sheol — Jacob, righteous mourner]

**Context (Gen 37:33-36):**
> 37:33 And he knew it, and said, [It is] my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
> 37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
> **37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.**
> 37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, [and] captain of the guard.

**Note:** "Grave" = H7585 (sheol). Jacob expects to join JOSEPH in sheol — a righteous patriarch expecting to go to the same place as his son (who is actually alive). Sheol is where ALL the dead go.

---

#### Numbers 16:30, 33 [sheol — Korah/Dathan go alive]

> **16:30 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that [appertain] unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.**
> 16:31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that [was] under them:
> 16:32 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that [appertained] unto Korah, and all [their] goods.
> **16:33 They, and all that [appertained] to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.**

**Note:** "Pit" = H7585 (sheol). Wicked men go alive into sheol — it is a place that receives even the living dead. "They perished" — sheol is where they are destroyed.

#### Psalm 9:17 [sheol — the wicked]

> **9:17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, [and] all the nations that forget God.**
> 9:18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall [not] perish for ever.

**Note:** "Hell" = H7585 (sheol). The wicked go to sheol. But so do the righteous (Gen 37:35; Ps 16:10). Sheol is not an exclusively wicked destination; the wicked are "turned INTO" it — meaning it is their end.

---

#### Psalm 16:10 [sheol — Messianic promise, not left in sheol]

**Full Psalm 16:**
> 16:1 Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
> 16:2 [O my soul], thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou [art] my Lord: my goodness [extendeth] not to thee;
> 16:5 The LORD [is] the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
> 16:7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
> 16:8 I have set the LORD always before me: because [he is] at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
> 16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
> **16:10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.**
> 16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence [is] fulness of joy; at thy right hand [there are] pleasures for evermore.

**Note:** "Hell" = H7585 (sheol). Peter quotes this in Acts 2:27,31 and applies it to Christ's resurrection. The SOUL (nephesh) goes to sheol but will not be ABANDONED there — resurrection is the escape. This is the definitive LXX equation verse: sheol → hades (cf. Acts 2:27).

---

#### Psalm 31:17 [sheol — the wicked silent there]

> 31:17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, [and] let them be silent in the grave.

**Note:** "Grave" = H7585 (sheol). The wicked are "silent" in sheol — consistent with the state of unconscious death. Silence = no praise, no activity, no consciousness.

---

#### Psalm 49:14-15 [sheol — all laid there, but God redeems]

> **49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.**
> **49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.**
> 49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
> 49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.

**Note:** "Grave" = H7585 (sheol) in both verses. ALL go to sheol (v.14 — they are laid there); but God will REDEEM from sheol (v.15) — this is the hope of resurrection. The contrast is not torment vs. rest, but sheol vs. redemption from sheol.

---

#### Psalm 115:17 [sheol — the dead do not praise]

> 115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.
> 115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.

**Note:** "Into silence" = down to sheol (parallel statement). The dead = those in sheol; they do not praise the Lord. Contrast: the living bless the Lord (v.18). This confirms sheol is a state of non-activity.

---

#### Psalm 139:8 [sheol — even there God is present]

> 139:7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
> **139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou [art] there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou [art there].**
> 139:9 [If] I take the wings of the morning, [and] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;

**Note:** "Hell" = H7585 (sheol). Sheol is presented as the extreme lower limit of existence — even there, God is present. This is cosmological language (heaven-sheol-sea = totality of creation). Not a description of torment.

---

#### Job 14:13 [sheol — Job's longing to be hidden there]

**Context (Job 14:8-19):**
> 14:10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where [is] he?
> 14:11 [As] the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:
> 14:12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens [be] no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
> **14:13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!**
> 14:14 If a man die, shall he live [again]? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
> 14:15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.

**Note:** "Grave" = H7585 (sheol). Job LONGS to go to sheol — to be HIDDEN there "until thy wrath be past." Sheol is a refuge from God's immediate wrath, not a place of torment from God. Job hopes to wait in sheol until resurrection ("till my change come" v.14).

---

#### Job 3:17-19 [sheol — the weary are at rest]

> **3:17 There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary be at rest.**
> **3:18 [There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.**
> **3:19 The small and great are there; and the servant [is] free from his master.**

**Note:** Describing sheol. The wicked CEASE troubling — they are no longer active. The weary REST. Prisoners REST. "Small and great are there" — all classes go to sheol. No torment language; rather, REST and CESSATION of activity.

---

#### Job 17:13-16 [sheol — Job's home and resting place]

> **17:13 If I wait, the grave [is] mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.**
> **17:14 I have said to corruption, Thou [art] my father: to the worm, [Thou art] my mother, and my sister.**
> **17:15 And where [is] now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?**
> **17:16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when [our] rest together [is] in the dust.**

**Note:** "Grave" = H7585 (sheol). Job calls sheol "mine house" — a resting place in darkness. Hope descends to sheol (the "bars of the pit") — meaning hope seems to end at sheol. Rest "in the dust."

---

#### Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10 [sheol — the dead know nothing]

> **9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.**
> 9:6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any [thing] that is done under the sun.
> 9:10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do [it] with thy might; for [there is] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.

**Note:** E017 and E019 from prior etc5 studies. The dead know nothing; there is no work, knowledge, or wisdom IN SHEOL. These are plain, unqualified statements. Hebrew parsing (see raw-data/hebrew-parsing.md) confirms: v.5 uses unconditional negation (ein + yodeim); v.10 explicitly names sheol.

---

#### Isaiah 14:9-15 [sheol — king of Babylon mocked]

> **14:9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet [thee] at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, [even] all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.**
> 14:10 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?
> **14:11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, [and] the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.**
> 14:12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! [how] art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
> 14:13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
> 14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
> **14:15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.**

**Note:** "Hell" = H7585 (sheol) in vv.9,11,15. This is POETRY (taunt song against Babylon's king). Sheol is personified — it "stirs up" the rephaim (dead shades) to mock the fallen king. Even the greatest kings are reduced to the same state in sheol. "Worms cover thee" = bodily decomposition. Sheol receives even the mightiest.

---

#### Isaiah 66:24 [OT source of gehenna imagery]

> **66:24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.**

**Note:** CRITICAL PASSAGE. Hebrew parsing confirms: פִגְרֵי (pigrê) = CORPSES (plural construct of peger, a dead body). The "worm" and "fire" work on CORPSES — not conscious persons. The fire is "not quenched" = not prematurely extinguished. The result is "abhorring" (deraon = abhorrence, also in Dan 12:2). Jesus quotes this verse in Mark 9:44,46,48.

---

#### Hosea 13:14 [sheol — to be ransomed from death]

> **13:14 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.**

**Note:** "Grave" = H7585 (sheol) in both occurrences. Paul quotes this in 1 Cor 15:55 (with hades). God will RANSOM from sheol, will DESTROY sheol itself. Sheol is an enemy to be defeated.

---

#### Deuteronomy 32:22 [sheol — fire burns to lowest]

> **32:22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.**

**Note:** "Hell" = H7585 (sheol). "Lowest sheol" = the uttermost depths of death. Used in a passage about God's judgment on Israel's idolatry. Fire as metaphor for divine wrath.

---

#### Ezekiel 32:21, 27 [sheol — warriors speak from within]

> **32:21 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.**
> 32:27 And they shall not lie with the mighty [that are] fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though [they were] the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

**Note:** "Hell" = H7585 (sheol). The mighty warriors "speak" from sheol — but this is poetic/prophetic language (same genre as Isa 14). Sheol is the realm of all the mighty dead. "Slain by the sword" — the dead are there in their death state.

---

### Part E — Valley of Hinnom OT Background

#### 2 Kings 23:10 [Tophet defiled by Josiah]

> **23:10 And he defiled Topheth, which [is] in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.**

**Note:** Josiah's reform — he defiled Tophet (the sacred burning site). The valley was the site of child sacrifice to Molech. By defiling it (making it ceremonially unclean), he stopped the practice. The valley then became associated with burning, garbage, and defilement — the background for Jesus's use of gehenna.

---

#### Jeremiah 7:31-32 [Tophet renamed valley of slaughter]

> **7:31 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which [is] in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded [them] not, neither came it into my heart.**
> **7:32 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.**
> 7:33 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray [them] away.

**Note:** God condemns child sacrifice in the valley of Hinnom. The valley will be renamed "the valley of slaughter." Dead bodies (carcases) will be left there for birds and beasts.

---

#### Jeremiah 19:2-6 [valley of Hinnom renamed]

> 19:2 And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which [is] by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,
> 19:3 And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.
> 19:4 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;
> 19:5 They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire [for] burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake [it], neither came [it] into my mind:
> **19:6 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.**

---

#### Jeremiah 32:35 [Hinnom — child sacrifice to Molech]

> **32:35 And they built the high places of Baal, which [are] in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.**

---

#### Isaiah 30:33 [Tophet prepared for the king]

> **30:33 For Tophet [is] ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made [it] deep [and] large: the pile thereof [is] fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.**

**Note:** Tophet as a metaphor for divine judgment — the pile of fire for the Assyrian king.

---

### Part F — Key Judgment Passages

#### Matthew 3:12 [fire — unquenchable, chaff burned]

> **3:12 Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.**

**Note:** "Unquenchable fire" (asbestos, G762) = a fire that cannot be extinguished — it burns until it consumes. The chaff is BURNED UP (katakaisei = burned completely). The fire is unquenchable because it consumes completely, not because it burns forever.

---

#### Matthew 25:41 and 25:46 [everlasting fire / everlasting punishment]

> **25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:**
> 25:42-45 [elaboration of failure to minister]
> **25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.**

**Note:** CRITICAL PASSAGE.
- "Everlasting fire" (pyr to aionion) and "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion) — same adjective aionios.
- Greek parsing (see raw-data/greek-parsing.md): κόλασιν = G2851 (kolasis, "cutting off/pruning"), αἰώνιον = G166 (aionios).
- The fire was "prepared for the devil and his angels" — not for humans per se; humans are thrown into it secondarily.
- The parallelism with "life eternal" (zoen aionion) — same adjective for both outcomes.

---

#### 2 Thessalonians 1:9 [eternal destruction]

> **1:9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;**

**Note:** "Everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion, G3639 + G166). The punishment = destruction (olethros). "From the presence of the Lord" = banished from God's presence. This is not torment language — it is destruction language.

---

#### Revelation 14:10-11 [torment with fire / smoke ascends forever]

> 14:9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
> **14:10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:**
> **14:11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.**

**Note:** CRITICAL PASSAGE. Greek parsing (see raw-data/greek-parsing.md):
- εἰς αἰῶνας αἰώνων (eis aionas aionon) = "into ages of ages" — the smoke ascends
- This is the strongest torment language in Revelation, specific to beast-worshippers
- Context: angelic warning vision in the midst of tribulation events (chs. 12-16)
- The SMOKE ascends forever — possibly an idiom for permanent destruction (cf. Isa 34:10 of Edom's smoke ascending).

---

#### Revelation 20:10 [devil tormented forever]

> **20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.**

**Note:** The devil, beast, and false prophet = tormented "day and night for ever and ever" in the lake of fire. NOTE: This verse specifies these three entities (supernatural beings). The same lake receives human dead (v.15) — but the specific ongoing torment language here is applied to the supernatural enemies.

---

#### Revelation 20:13-15 [full judgment passage]

> **20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.**
> **20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.**
> **20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.**

---

#### Revelation 21:4, 8 [no more death / second death]

> **21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.**
> 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

**Note:** Rev 21:4 confirms "no more death" in the new creation — because hades and death have been cast into the lake of fire (20:14). Rev 21:8 = the lake of fire = the second death.

---

### Part G — Rephaim (H7496) Passages

#### Job 26:5-6 [rephaim under the waters / sheol naked]

> **26:5 Dead [things] are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.**
> **26:6 Hell [is] naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.**

**Note:** "Dead things" = H7496 (rephaim — the dead/shades). Sheol is "naked before God" = completely exposed to divine sight.

---

#### Psalm 88:11 [the dead in sheol cannot praise]

> **88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise [and] praise thee? Selah.**
> **88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? [or] thy faithfulness in destruction?**

**Note:** The grave = sheol. No lovingkindness declared there, no faithfulness proclaimed — the dead cannot praise or declare. Consistent with Ps 115:17.

---

#### Proverbs 2:18 [paths lead to rephaim]

> **2:18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.**

**Note:** "The dead" = H7496 (rephaim). The paths of the strange woman lead to the realm of the dead.

---

#### Proverbs 9:18 [guests are rephaim in depths of sheol]

> **9:18 But he knoweth not that the dead [are] there; [and that] her guests [are] in the depths of hell.**

**Note:** "The dead" = H7496 (rephaim). "Depths of hell" = the deep places of sheol.

---

#### Proverbs 21:16 [wanders to congregation of rephaim]

> **21:16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.**

**Note:** "The dead" = H7496 (rephaim). The "congregation of the rephaim" = the assembled dead in sheol.

---

#### Isaiah 26:14, 19 [rephaim will not rise / but God's dead will]

> **26:14 [They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.**
> 26:19 Thy dead [men] shall live, [together with] my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew [is as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

**Note:** v.14 "deceased" = H7496 (rephaim). A contrast between two groups: the enemies (rephaim who shall NOT rise — v.14) and God's people (who SHALL rise — v.19). The rephaim are the dead who remain permanently dead; the righteous will be resurrected.

---

### Part H — Tsalmaveth (H6757) — Shadow of Death

#### Psalm 23:4

> **23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou [art] with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.**

**Note:** "Shadow of death" = H6757 (tsalmaveth). The darkest valley — associated with death's shadow. God's presence overcomes even the shadow of death.

---

#### Psalm 107:10, 14

> **107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, [being] bound in affliction and iron;**
> **107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.**

**Note:** "Shadow of death" = H6757 (tsalmaveth). Used of oppression and imprisonment — liberation from death's shadow = divine deliverance.

---

#### Isaiah 9:1-2

> **9:1 Nevertheless the dimness [shall] not [be] such as [was] in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict [her by] the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.**
> **9:2 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.**

**Note:** "Shadow of death" = H6757 (tsalmaveth). Used of spiritual darkness and oppression — messianic light overcomes the shadow of death. Matthew quotes this in 4:16 regarding Jesus's ministry in Galilee.

## Additional Context Passages

### Revelation 21:8 [second death = lake of fire]

> **21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.**

### 2 Peter 2:6 [Sodom turned to ashes — eternal fire = ashes]

> **2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;**

**Note:** CRITICAL. Jude 1:7 calls Sodom's judgment "eternal fire." 2 Pet 2:6 describes the SAME judgment as "turning into ashes." The eternal fire produced permanent destruction (ashes) — not ongoing burning. This is the biblical definition of "eternal fire" from the Bible's own cross-reference.
