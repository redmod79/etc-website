# Analysis
## Study: etc5-05 — Four "Hell" Words (Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, Tartaroo)

---

## Part 1 — H7585 Sheol (OT: 67 Occurrences)

### 1.1 Definition and Basic Scope

H7585 (שְׁאוֹל, shᵉʼôwl) is the primary OT Hebrew term for the realm of the dead. Strong's defines it as "hades or the world of the dead (as if a subterranean retreat), including its accessories and inmates — grave, hell, pit." The word appears 67 times across 14 OT books, concentrated in the wisdom and prophetic literature: Job (12×), Psalms (13–16×), Proverbs (9×), and Isaiah (14×).

The KJV renders H7585 with 25 distinct English phrases across those 67 occurrences. The breakdown by category:
- "grave" renderings (to the grave, in the grave, the grave, of the grave, into the grave, from the grave, and variants): approximately 31 occurrences (~46%)
- "hell" renderings (hell, of hell, in hell, into hell, to hell, from hell): approximately 31 occurrences (~46%)
- "pit" renderings (into the pit, in the pit): approximately 3 occurrences (~4%)
- Remaining: 2 other renderings

The KJV consistently uses "hell" for poetic and prophetic contexts (Isa, Deut, Ps 86:13) and "grave" for narrative and wisdom literature (Gen, Job, Ecc). The same Hebrew word, in the same period of Jewish history, is rendered by the translators as either "hell" or "grave" based on literary context — a consistent translation decision that does not reflect two different Hebrew words or two different concepts.

### 1.2 Who Goes to Sheol?

The OT texts on sheol do not restrict it to the wicked. The evidence:

**Righteous persons:**
- Jacob (Gen 37:35): "I will go down into the grave [sheol] unto my son mourning." Jacob, a righteous patriarch, expects to go to sheol. He anticipates joining Joseph there (Joseph is actually alive — Jacob does not know this).
- David (Ps 16:10): "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [sheol]." David anticipates his soul going to sheol; the hope is that God will not LEAVE it there, not that it will avoid sheol.
- Job (Job 14:13): "O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave [sheol], that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past." Job expresses a longing to be hidden in sheol — a righteous sufferer regarding sheol as a refuge, not a torment.
- Job (Job 17:13): "If I wait, the grave [sheol] is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness." Sheol = Job's anticipated home.
- Job (Job 3:17-19): Describing sheol — "There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary are at rest. There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master." Small and great, weary and wicked, slave and free — all classes in sheol.

**Wicked persons:**
- Ps 9:17: "The wicked shall be turned into hell [sheol], and all the nations that forget God."
- Proverbs (5:5; 7:27; 9:18): The paths of the adulterous lead to sheol.
- Isa 14:15: The king of Babylon brought down to sheol ("the sides of the pit").
- Hab 2:5: The proud, greedy man enlarges his appetite "as hell [sheol], and is as death, and cannot be satisfied."

**Conclusion from the evidence:** Sheol is the destination of all the dead, both righteous and wicked. The texts that associate sheol with the wicked do not state that the righteous avoid it — they merely note that the wicked also go there. The texts that show righteous going to sheol confirm it is the universal realm of the dead.

### 1.3 Conditions in Sheol

Multiple independent biblical authors describe sheol consistently:

**Silence and inactivity:**
- Ps 31:17: "let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave [sheol]." Silence = the characteristic of sheol.
- Ps 115:17: "The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence." Parallel statement: going down to sheol = going down to silence.
- Job 3:17-18: The weary are "at rest"; prisoners "rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor."

**Absence of consciousness and activity:**
- Ecc 9:5 (E017): "The dead know not any thing." (See also E019: no work, device, knowledge, or wisdom in the grave.)
- Job 3:19: "The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master." Status distinctions cease.
- Job 14:21 (E021): "His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not." The dead do not perceive events.

**Darkness:**
- Job 10:21-22: "Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; a land of darkness... without any order, and where the light is as darkness."
- Job 17:13: "I have made my bed in the darkness."

**God's sovereignty extends into sheol:**
- Ps 139:8: "If I make my bed in hell [sheol], behold, thou art there." Sheol is not beyond God's reach or presence.
- Deut 32:22: "A fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell [sheol]." God's judgment extends to the depths of sheol.
- Job 26:6: "Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering." Sheol is fully visible to God.

**Sheol is temporary for some (rescue/redemption):**
- Ps 16:10: The soul goes to sheol; the hope is that God will not leave it there ("thou wilt not LEAVE my soul in sheol").
- Ps 30:3: "O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave."
- Ps 49:15: "God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me."
- Hos 13:14: "I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death." God will destroy sheol itself.
- Job 14:13-15 (E094): Job waits in the grave until God's "change" comes and God calls — a resurrection hope.

The rescue language applies primarily to the righteous; the wicked are not said to be redeemed from sheol in these OT texts.

### 1.4 Key Metaphorical and Poetic Uses

Several passages use sheol in highly figurative or personified ways:

**Isaiah 14:9-15 (taunt song against Babylon's king):** "Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead [rephaim] for thee." Sheol is personified as roused to receive the tyrant. The dead rulers of the nations speak to greet him. This is prophetic poetry — a taunt song (genre marker: v.4 calls it a "proverb" or "taunting speech"). The imagery of rephaim speaking and rising from their thrones is literary personification, not a literal description of activity in sheol.

**Ezekiel 32:21, 27:** Mighty warriors "speak" from sheol; kings lie in sheol with their weapons. Again, the genre is prophetic oracle/lament over fallen nations — literary personification of the dead.

**Isaiah 5:14:** "Therefore hell [sheol] hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure." Sheol is personified as an insatiable creature. This is metaphor — sheol is not described as having an inner experience but as consuming the dead wholesale.

**Proverbs 27:20:** "Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied." Sheol paired with "destruction" (avaddon) as a metaphor for insatiability.

These personified and figurative uses do not describe the inner experience of persons in sheol — they are literary devices applied to sheol as a concept. The prose and wisdom literature (Genesis, Job, Ecclesiastes) that describes what the dead actually experience in sheol consistently presents silence, rest, and the absence of activity.

### 1.5 H7496 Rephaim — The Dead Inhabitants of Sheol

The rephaim (plural of H7496, rephāʼ, "lax/limp/weak") are the shades of the dead inhabiting sheol. The root denotes slackness or weakness. The 8 OT occurrences consistently present them as inactive:
- Isa 26:14: "They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased [rephaim], they shall not rise."
- Isa 26:19 (by contrast): The righteous will arise — the resurrection distinction is between rephaim (permanently dead) and those God raises.
- Ps 88:10: "Shall the dead [rephaim] arise and praise thee?"
- Job 26:5: "Dead things [rephaim] are formed from under the waters" — beneath the earth, passive.

The LXX translators used both G3498 (nekros, the dead) and G86 (hades) to render rephaim — confirming that the rephaim inhabit the hades/sheol realm. The image is of weak, inactive shadows of the dead, not conscious suffering persons.

### 1.6 H6757 Tsalmaveth — Shadow of Death

H6757 (tsalmaveth, "shadow of death") occurs 18 times and is a compound of tsel (shadow) + maveth (death). It is a poetic expression for extreme darkness, danger, and proximity to death — not a distinct location from sheol but a descriptive characterization of the death-state and situations of mortal danger. All 18 KJV occurrences render it "shadow of death" or a variant. It reinforces the OT picture of sheol as a dark, inactive realm (cf. Job 10:21-22 using both sheol and tsalmaveth in the same passage).

---

## Part 2 — G86 Hades (NT: 11 Occurrences)

### 2.1 Definition and Etymology

G86 (ᾅδης, háidēs) derives from G1 (alpha-privative) + G1492 (to see) = "the unseen place." It is the Greek equivalent of the underworld — both the location and (in classical Greek) the god of the underworld.

Strong's: "properly, unseen, i.e. 'Hades' or the place (state) of departed souls."

All 11 KJV occurrences are rendered "hell" (9×) or "grave" (1×, at 1 Cor 15:55) — the KJV never retains "hades." The RV and most modern translations retain "Hades."

### 2.2 LXX Equation: Hades = Sheol

The LXX translated H7585 (sheol) as G86 (hades) 58 times out of 67 sheol occurrences — a PMI score of 33.87, dominant by a large margin over any other Greek rendering. This is the strongest single lexical correspondence in the entire LXX:

| Greek | Count | PMI Score |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| G86 hades | 58 | 33.87 |
| G2609 katago (bring down) | 10 | 14.59 |
| G2288 thanatos (death) | 14 | 11.98 |

This statistical dominance confirms the LXX translators treated sheol and hades as equivalent terms. NT uses of G86 (hades) inherit the full OT semantic range of H7585 (sheol).

Two NT quotations of OT sheol passages confirm this equation in the NT text itself:
- Acts 2:27 quotes Ps 16:10 (sheol) using hades: "Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [hades]."
- Acts 2:31 interprets the resurrection as the soul "not left in hell [hades]."
- 1 Cor 15:55 quotes Hos 13:14 (sheol) using hades: "O grave [hades], where is thy victory?"

### 2.3 All 11 Hades Occurrences — Analysis

**Matt 11:23 / Luke 10:15 (paired synoptic):** "Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell [hades]." The heaven/hades contrast is spatial — the city is brought DOWN (cast low). This is judgment language using hades as the opposite of heaven/exaltation. It does not describe the inner state of hades.

**Matt 16:18:** "The gates of hell [hades] shall not prevail against [the church]." The "gates of hades" = the gates of death/the realm of the dead. The church cannot be overcome by death. This is about death's power over God's people, not about the nature of hades itself.

**Luke 16:23:** "And in hell [hades] he lift up his eyes, being in torments." (Full passage: 16:19-31.) This is the ONLY NT occurrence describing conscious experience from inside hades. The passage is the rich man and Lazarus — an account delivered by Jesus in a parabolic context (series of parables to the Pharisees, Luke 15-16). The stated purpose of the account is the sufficiency of Moses and the prophets (v.31). This passage is examined under Difficult Passages (Part 6 below).

**Acts 2:27:** Peter quotes Ps 16:10 in the Pentecost sermon. Christ's soul was in hades between death and resurrection. Peter immediately establishes that David "is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day" (v.29) — David, who wrote Ps 16:10, was still in hades (the text implies) as of Pentecost. Peter applies the prophecy specifically to Christ's resurrection, not to David's.

**Acts 2:31:** Peter explains: "His soul was not left in hell [hades], neither his flesh did see corruption." The resurrection = the departure of the soul from hades. Hades is where souls are until the resurrection.

**1 Corinthians 15:55:** Paul quotes Hos 13:14 (LXX). "O grave [hades], where is thy victory?" Hades = the grave, the enemy to be defeated at the resurrection. Paul uses this as a taunt against death itself — its final defeat at the last trumpet.

**Revelation 1:18:** "I have the keys of hell [hades] and of death." Christ holds authority over the realm of the dead. Death and hades are paired as twin powers of the post-fall world. Christ entered hades (died) and emerged (resurrection); he now holds the keys.

**Revelation 6:8:** "His name that sat on him was Death, and Hell [hades] followed with him." Death kills; hades follows to receive the dead. This personification confirms hades as the receiver of the dead in the post-fall era.

**Revelation 20:13:** "Death and hell [hades] delivered up the dead which were in them; and they were judged every man according to their works." Hades DELIVERS UP the dead for judgment. Hades holds the dead until the resurrection-judgment. At that point, hades hands over its contents.

**Revelation 20:14:** "And death and hell [hades] were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." CRITICAL. Hades is not the final destination — it is itself cast into the lake of fire and abolished at the final judgment. Hades ends. The lake of fire is distinct from hades; it receives hades as a thing to be destroyed.

### 2.4 Hades and the Lake of Fire: Explicit Distinction

Rev 20:14 makes an explicit textual distinction between hades and the lake of fire:
1. Hades is cast INTO the lake of fire — they are separate entities.
2. Hades is destroyed ("cast into the lake of fire") — it ceases to exist.
3. The lake of fire is identified as the second death — a final state.
4. Hades is identified as the pre-judgment state of the dead; the lake of fire is the post-judgment fate.

This distinction is already established by N026 (hades = temporary holding state). This study adds explicit textual confirmation (E148 implicitly covered by E110): hades and the lake of fire are not the same thing.

## Part 3 — G1067 Gehenna (NT: 12 Occurrences)

### 3.1 Etymology and OT Background

G1067 (γέεννα, géenna) derives from the Hebrew גֵּי הִנֹּם (gê Hinnôm = "Valley of [the son of] Hinnom," H1516 + H2011). The valley lay south/southwest of Jerusalem. Its history:
- Site of child sacrifice to Molech under wicked kings (2 Ki 23:10; 2 Chr 28:3; 33:6; Jer 7:31).
- Josiah defiled it (2 Ki 23:10) — making it ceremonially unclean and stopping the practice.
- Jeremiah prophesied it would be renamed "the valley of slaughter" (Jer 7:32; 19:6).
- It became a perpetually burning dump for refuse and corpses — the tophet.
- Isaiah 30:33 uses tophet as a metaphor for divine judgment: a pile of fire prepared for the Assyrian king.
- Isaiah 66:24 is the definitive OT text on which Jesus's gehenna imagery is based.

### 3.2 Isaiah 66:24 — The Source Text

Isaiah 66:24 is the OT source of the "worm shall not die, fire is not quenched" imagery:

> "And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases [pigrê, H6297] of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh."

Key observations:
- The word rendered "carcases" is פִגְרֵי (pigrê), the plural construct of H6297 (peger) = "a dead body" or "corpse." This is the ordinary Hebrew word for a dead body (used in Gen 15:11; Num 14:29,32,33; 2 Chr 20:24,25; Isa 14:19; 34:3; 37:36; Nah 3:3).
- The objects on which the worm and fire work are CORPSES — dead bodies, not conscious persons.
- "Shall not die" and "shall not be quenched" describe the worm and fire, not the persons — the worm persists because there is sufficient material; the fire is not extinguished because it is not quenched prematurely.
- The result of the whole scene is "abhorring" (deraon, H1860) — an object of horrified aversion. The same word appears in Dan 12:2 for those who come to "everlasting contempt."

Jesus directly quotes this verse in Mark 9:44, 46, and 48 (cross-testament parallel hybrid score 0.424 — the top NT parallel for Isa 66:24). The refrain "where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" is a direct citation of Isa 66:24.

### 3.3 All 12 Gehenna Occurrences — Analysis

**Matthew 5:22:** "Danger of hell fire [geennan tou puros]." Escalating condemnation: judgment → council → gehenna. Gehenna = final condemnation outcome.

**Matthew 5:29-30 (paired):** "The whole body should be cast into hell [gehenna]." The body is what goes to gehenna — physical language for the person's complete destruction. The contrast: better to lose one member than the whole body go to gehenna.

**Matthew 10:28 (CRITICAL):** "Fear him which is able to destroy [apollesai, G622 apollumi] both soul and body in hell [gehenna]." The verb is ἀπολέσαι — the Aorist Active Infinitive of apollumi (G622), the word for "destroy" or "perish completely." It is not βασανίζω (to torment) or κολάζω (to punish). The explicit statement is that both soul and body are DESTROYED in gehenna. God's ability over gehenna is framed in terms of destruction, not torment. This is E026 (already in master).

**Matthew 18:8-9:** v.8 calls it "everlasting fire" (pyr to aionion); v.9 calls it "gehenna of fire." Both expressions used interchangeably in the same pericope for the same destination.

**Matthew 23:15:** "Twofold more the child of hell [gehenna]." Idiomatic — "son of gehenna" means "one destined for gehenna."

**Matthew 23:33:** "How can ye escape the damnation of hell [krisis geennēs]?" — the judgment of gehenna.

**Mark 9:43-48 (CRITICAL):** The passage uses gehenna three times (vv.43, 45, 47) and appends the refrain "where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" three times (vv.44, 46, 48). Each refrain is a quotation of Isa 66:24. The OT source text has pigrê (corpses) as the objects of the worm and fire. The "fire that never shall be quenched" = a fire not prematurely extinguished — it burns to completion. The "never quenched" character of the fire describes the fire's thoroughness, not its eternal duration.

**Luke 12:5:** "Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell [gehenna]." The sequence is physical death, then casting into gehenna — the power over gehenna extends beyond bodily death.

**James 3:6:** "It is set on fire of hell [gehenna]." James uses gehenna as a metaphor for destructive, consuming fire — the tongue's destructive power compared to gehenna's fire. The metaphor functions because gehenna was understood as the symbol of thorough destruction by fire.

### 3.4 Vocabulary Absent from Gehenna Passages

A critical lexical observation: the torment vocabulary is systematically absent from all 12 gehenna passages.

| Word | Definition | Appears in any of 12 gehenna passages? |
|------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| G928 βασανίζω (basanizo) | to torment, to torture | No |
| G929 βασανισμός (basanismos) | torment, torture | No |
| G931 βάσανος (basanos) | a touchstone/torment | No |
| G622 ἀπόλλυμι (apollumi) | to destroy, to perish | Yes (Matt 10:28 — destruction) |

The torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos/basanos) appears in Luke 16:23-28 (hades — the rich man account), Revelation 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers), and Revelation 20:10 (devil, beast, false prophet). None of these passages uses the word gehenna. Gehenna is consistently associated with fire and destruction (apollumi), not the torment vocabulary.

### 3.5 "Unquenchable Fire" and "Everlasting Fire"

Two fire-descriptors used with gehenna require attention:

**"Fire that never shall be quenched" / "unquenchable fire" (G762 asbestos — Matt 3:12; Mark 9:43-48):**
The word asbestos means "unquenchable" = cannot be put out. It does not mean "never stops burning." An unquenchable fire burns until it has consumed its fuel completely, without being artificially extinguished. Matt 3:12 says the chaff is "burned up" (katakaisei, G2618 = burned completely, consumed) with unquenchable fire. The result of unquenchable fire on chaff is complete burning-up, not perpetual burning.

**"Everlasting fire" (pyr to aionion — Matt 18:8; Matt 25:41; Jude 1:7):**
The adjective aionios (G166) is the same adjective used for "eternal life" and "everlasting punishment" in Matt 25:46. Jude 1:7 calls Sodom's destruction "eternal fire." 2 Pet 2:6 describes the same event as "turning the cities... into ashes." The biblical precedent: "eternal fire" on Sodom produced ashes, not ongoing burning. The "eternal" character of the fire refers to the finality/permanence of the result, not to the fire's continuous burning.

## Part 4 — G5020 Tartaroo (NT: 1 Occurrence)

### 4.1 Definition and Etymology

G5020 (ταρταρόω, tartaróō) is a verb formed from Τάρταρος (Tartaros) — the name of the deepest abyss in Greek mythology, below even Hades, where the Titans were imprisoned (Hesiod's Theogony). Peter borrows this term from Greek cosmological vocabulary to describe the confinement of fallen angels, using imagery familiar to his audience.

Strong's: "from Tartaros (the deepest abyss of Hades); to incarcerate in eternal torment / the deepest abyss."

**Note:** The Strong's gloss "to incarcerate in eternal torment" reflects an interpretive tradition but is not demanded by the grammar of the single occurrence. The verse itself characterizes the state as "chains of darkness" and "unto judgment," not as ongoing torment.

### 4.2 The Only Occurrence — 2 Peter 2:4

> "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell [ταρταρώσας, tartarosas], and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment."

Key grammatical observations:
- **ταρταρώσας** = Aorist Active Participle, Nominative Singular Masculine = "having cast down to Tartarus." The action is completed; they are already confined.
- **Subject = ἀγγέλων (angels)** — this passage applies exclusively to fallen angels, not to humans.
- **σειροῖς ζόφου** = "in chains/pits of darkness/gloom" — the characterization of the confinement is darkness (ζόφος), not fire or torment.
- **τηρουμένους εἰς κρίσιν** = "being kept/reserved unto judgment" (Present Passive Participle, indicating ongoing state) — they are being held FOR judgment, which is still future. This is a pre-judgment confinement state.

### 4.3 Jude 1:6 — The Parallel

Jude 1:6 describes the same event: "And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."

Jude confirms: (1) same angels, (2) "chains under darkness" — matching 2 Pet 2:4's "chains of darkness," (3) "unto the judgment of the great day" — pre-judgment confinement until the great day.

The immediately following verse, Jude 1:7, uses Sodom as a parallel example: "Even as Sodom and Gomorrha... suffering the vengeance of eternal fire." 2 Pet 2:6 (same author as 2 Pet 2:4) describes Sodom as "turning... into ashes." The juxtaposition in both letters of the angels-in-confinement example with the Sodom example (eternal fire = ashes) appears to be a deliberate pair of OT judgment illustrations.

### 4.4 Scope and Limitations of Tartaroo

Tartaroo's semantic scope is severely limited by its single occurrence:
- Applies only to fallen angels — not a single human is said to be "tartaroo'd."
- Describes pre-judgment confinement, not post-judgment final state.
- Characterized by darkness, not fire or torment.
- The purpose stated in the text is custody "unto judgment" — the final judgment is still future from the text's perspective.
- Cannot be extended to describe the fate of humans without adding concepts not present in the text.

---

## Part 5 — Patterns Identified

### 5.1 Translation Collapse in the KJV

The KJV renders four distinct Greek/Hebrew terms as "hell":
- H7585 (sheol): the realm of all the dead (OT)
- G86 (hades): the NT equivalent of sheol
- G1067 (gehenna): the eschatological judgment symbol
- G5020 (tartaroo): a verb for angelic pre-judgment confinement

A reader of the KJV sees one English word where the original texts use four distinct terms with four distinct referents and four distinct scopes. The translation collapse creates the impression of a single homogeneous concept. The word studies demonstrate that these four terms are not interchangeable and describe different realities at different points in the eschatological sequence.

### 5.2 Temporal Sequence of the Four Terms

The four terms describe different points in the sequence of death and judgment:

| Stage | Term | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Pre-judgment: fallen angels | Tartaroo | Temporary pre-judgment confinement in darkness |
| Pre-judgment: all the dead | Sheol / Hades | Temporary holding state until resurrection |
| Post-judgment: final fate | Gehenna / Lake of fire | Symbol of final judgment outcome |
| Post-judgment: destruction of hades | — | Hades itself cast into lake of fire (Rev 20:14) |

Sheol/hades are not the same as the lake of fire/gehenna. They exist on opposite sides of the judgment event. Revelation 20 explicitly sequences this: hades delivers up its dead for judgment (v.13), then hades is cast into the lake of fire (v.14).

### 5.3 The Apollumi / Torment Vocabulary Divide

The vocabulary associated with each term:

| Term | Associated vocabulary | Torment vocabulary present? |
|------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Sheol | Silence, rest, darkness, the dead | No |
| Hades | Death (paired with hades), keys, gates | No (except Luke 16:23 — disputed genre) |
| Gehenna | Fire, apollumi (destroy), unquenched | No (βασανισμός absent from all 12 passages) |
| Lake of fire | βασανισμός (Rev 14:10-11; 20:10) | Yes — but not called gehenna |

The explicit torment vocabulary (βασανίζω, βασανισμός) is concentrated in:
- Luke 16:23-28 (hades — parabolic account, genre disputed — IB006)
- Revelation 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers — tribulation context)
- Revelation 20:10 (devil, beast, false prophet — supernatural entities specifically named)

The 12 gehenna passages use destruction vocabulary (apollumi) and fire imagery but not torment vocabulary.

### 5.4 Sodom as the Biblical Definition of "Eternal Fire"

Jude 1:7 and 2 Pet 2:6 provide a biblical self-definition of "eternal fire" through cross-reference:
- Jude 1:7: Sodom "suffering the vengeance of eternal fire [puros aioniou]."
- 2 Pet 2:6 (same author, same examples): "turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes."

The same event is described as "eternal fire" in Jude and "into ashes" in 2 Peter. The cross-testament parallel hybrid score (JUD 1:7 → 2PE 2:6) is 0.471 — the highest-scoring parallel for Jude 1:7. These two passages by the same author on the same event provide the Bible's own working definition: "eternal fire" = fire that permanently destroys (produces ashes), not fire that continues burning forever.

Sodom is not still burning today. The adjective "eternal/everlasting" (aionios) modifies the fire's result or character, not its ongoing process.

### 5.5 The Rev 20:10 Specificity

Revelation 20:10 is the strongest ongoing-torment passage in the entire NT:
> "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."

Three observations from the text itself:
1. The subjects explicitly named are the devil, the beast, and the false prophet — specific supernatural entities (and one may be a human figure, but the beast and false prophet are at minimum symbolic/representative entities distinct from ordinary humans).
2. The same lake receives human dead in v.15: "Whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." But v.15 does not use torment language — it uses "cast into."
3. The ongoing torment language of Rev 20:10 is specific to the three named entities. The text does not apply "tormented day and night for ever and ever" to the humans cast in per v.15.

Whether the specific torment described for the devil/beast/false prophet extends to all persons in the lake of fire is a contested inference (IB008), not a statement of the text.

## Part 6 — Difficult Passages

### 6.1 Luke 16:23 — The Rich Man in Hades

The account of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) is the only NT passage describing conscious experience inside hades. The rich man is described as "in torments" (en basanois), seeing Abraham, communicating across a "great gulf," and expressing concern for his brothers.

**Genre considerations:**
- The passage follows a series of Lucan parables (Luke 15: lost sheep, lost coin, prodigal son; Luke 16: unjust steward, then rich man). The rich man and Lazarus appears in the same teaching context (Jesus responding to the Pharisees, v.14).
- Named characters appear in parables elsewhere (Lazarus in John 11 is a distinct figure; the use of a name does not automatically indicate non-parabolic genre).
- The primary stated message is v.31: "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead." The account's climax is a statement about the sufficiency of Scripture, not an exposition of the intermediate state.
- Physical impossibilities suggest symbolic/parabolic function: visible communication across a gulf, water dipping as relief.

**What the text says:**
- Hades is used (G86) — not gehenna, not the lake of fire.
- The rich man is conscious in hades (torment, seeing, speaking).
- Lazarus is in "Abraham's bosom" (not elsewhere described in OT or NT; only here).
- A "great gulf fixed" separates the two.

**The classification:** IB006 (existing item in master) — genre question prevents resolution. The parable's stated purpose is sufficiency of Scripture. The detail of conscious torment in hades conflicts with the plain state-of-death passages. See master evidence IB006.

This passage is not directly relevant to gehenna; it uses hades. If taken literally, it provides evidence for a conscious intermediate state in hades (IB001, IB006). The conflict with N026 (hades = temporary holding state with no description of inner torment) and N023 (dead lack consciousness across multiple independent witnesses) remains the same tension documented in IB001.

### 6.2 Isaiah 14:9-15 — The King of Babylon in Sheol

Isaiah 14:9-15 is among the most vivid sheol passages:
> "Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead [rephaim] for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we?"

**Genre:** The passage is an explicit taunt song (v.4: "thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon"). Taunt songs are a recognized OT prophetic-poetic genre (cf. Amos 5:2; Hab 2:6). The imagery of sheol "stirring up" the rephaim and the fallen kings speaking is literary personification — the same genre as Ezekiel 32:21, 27 (warriors speaking from sheol).

**What the passage teaches:** Even the mightiest rulers go to sheol. The great king will be leveled to the same state as all the other dead kings. "Art thou also become weak as we?" — sheol is characterized by weakness and diminishment, not ongoing power. The worms covering the tyrant (v.11) = bodily decomposition.

**The speaking rephaim:** The address of the dead kings to the arriving tyrant is a literary device — not a description of ongoing conscious conversation in sheol, any more than wisdom literature's personification of Lady Wisdom (Prov 8-9) is a literal description of a separate divine being. Genre governs interpretation.

### 6.3 Mark 9:43-48 — "The Fire Is Not Quenched"

The three-fold refrain ("where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched") directly quotes Isa 66:24. In Isa 66:24:
- Objects = pigrê (corpses, dead bodies)
- Worm and fire act on dead bodies
- Result = "abhorring unto all flesh" — a spectacle of judgment's completeness

The "never quenched" fire = a fire that burns without being prematurely extinguished — it consumes completely. The same imagery in Matt 3:12: unquenchable fire burns up the chaff (katakaisei = burns completely). The fire's "never quenched" character speaks to the completeness and certainty of judgment, not to the fire's eternal duration.

The passage does not describe the experience of conscious persons in gehenna — it describes the outcome visible to the righteous as they "go forth" (Isa 66:24: "they shall go forth, and look").

### 6.4 Matthew 25:46 — Aionion Punishment vs. Aionion Life

> "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment [kolasin aionion]: but the righteous into life eternal [zoen aionion]."

The same adjective aionios modifies both outcomes. The word kolasis (G2851) has a range: "cutting off/pruning" (agricultural sense), "punishment/penalty," "correction." The noun kolasis is distinct from basanismos (torment) and olethros (destruction).

**The textual observation (E119, existing master item):** The same adjective aionion modifies both punishment and life. This is a plain grammatical fact both sides acknowledge. What this implies depends on how one understands aionios — whether it means "eternal in duration" (infinite time) or "belonging to the age to come" (eschatological quality). Both readings are grammatically possible. This is the basis for IB items rather than E or N.

What the text does NOT say: it does not specify whether the kolasis (punishment) is torment or destruction. The word itself can include both. The parallel with "life" argues that the same quality/duration applies to both outcomes — but what that quality/duration is requires additional interpretive steps.

### 6.5 Revelation 14:10-11 and 20:10 — "For Ever and Ever"

These are the two explicit ongoing-torment passages:

**Rev 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers):**
- "Shall be tormented with fire and brimstone... the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever [eis aionas aionon]: and they have no rest day nor night."
- Subjects: those who worship the beast and receive his mark — a specific tribulation context.
- The smoke ascends forever — compare Isa 34:10 on Edom: "the smoke thereof shall go up for ever" — same idiom applied to a judgment that produced ruins, not ongoing burning.

**Rev 20:10 (devil, beast, false prophet):**
- "Shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
- Subjects: the devil, the beast, and the false prophet — three specific named entities.
- These three are thrown into the lake of fire "where the beast and the false prophet are" — they have been there since Rev 19:20 when the beast and false prophet were cast in at the beginning of the millennium.

**What both passages say:** These passages explicitly use torment language with "for ever and ever" language (E149 and E150 in this study; reclassified to Neutral in etc5-18 audit — subjects are symbolic entities or specific class; grammar shows "for ever" attaches to smoke; same formula = cessation in Rev 19:3). Neither passage uses the word gehenna. The question of whether their specific descriptions extend to all persons in the lake of fire is addressed in IB008 below.

## Part 7 — Word Study Insights

### 7.1 The Interchangeability Question — Direct Answer

**Sheol and Hades:** Interchangeable for the same underlying reality. LXX proves this lexically (58/67 occurrences); NT quotations of OT sheol passages prove this textually (Acts 2:27/Ps 16:10; 1 Cor 15:55/Hos 13:14). Any claim about sheol carries directly into hades and vice versa.

**Gehenna and Sheol/Hades:** NOT interchangeable. They describe different stages in the eschatological sequence:
- Sheol/hades = the current state of the dead, before judgment, temporary
- Gehenna = the post-judgment final fate, permanent
- Revelation 20:13-14 explicitly sequences: hades delivers up its dead FOR judgment → hades is cast into the lake of fire (gehenna-like final judgment)

**Tartaroo and all other terms:** NOT interchangeable with any of the others. Its scope is uniquely limited to fallen angels in a pre-judgment confinement state. It cannot legitimately be applied to human experience.

### 7.2 Inherent Meaning of Each Term for Eternal Conscious Torment

The word studies yield a consistent answer across all four terms:

**Sheol** does not inherently mean eternal conscious torment. Its 67 OT occurrences show it receives righteous and wicked alike; it is characterized by silence, darkness, inactivity, and rest; the explicit state-of-death vocabulary (E017, E019, E014, E015, E016) consistently describes the absence of consciousness.

**Hades** does not inherently mean eternal conscious torment. It is the NT equivalent of sheol (LXX proof, NT quotation proof). It is itself destroyed at Rev 20:14 — if hades were eternal conscious torment, its destruction would end eternal conscious torment. The one passage depicting conscious experience in hades (Luke 16:23) is genre-disputed (IB006).

**Gehenna** does not inherently mean eternal conscious torment. The key verb in the definitive passage (Matt 10:28) is apollumi (destroy). The source imagery (Isa 66:24) operates on corpses, not conscious persons. The torment vocabulary is absent from all 12 gehenna passages. The "eternal fire" descriptor is defined by Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6 as producing ashes (permanent result) rather than ongoing burning.

**Tartaroo** does not apply to humans and cannot be cited for human post-mortem torment. Its single occurrence involves fallen angels in pre-judgment darkness.

## Part 8 — Connections Between Passages

### 8.1 Cross-Testament Lexical Chain: Sheol → Hades → Luke 16 → Rev 20

1. OT uses sheol for all the dead (Jacob, David, Job, wicked kings).
2. LXX translates sheol as hades 58 times — establishing equivalence.
3. NT writers quote OT sheol texts using hades (Acts 2:27; 1 Cor 15:55) — confirming equivalence.
4. NT uses of hades follow the sheol pattern: realm of the dead, temporary, receives and holds the dead.
5. At Rev 20:13, hades delivers up the dead for judgment.
6. At Rev 20:14, hades is itself abolished — cast into the lake of fire.
7. The lake of fire is the second death — the post-judgment final fate distinct from hades.

### 8.2 The Valley of Hinnom → Tophet → Gehenna Chain

1. The valley of Hinnom was the site of child sacrifice to Molech (2 Ki 23:10; Jer 7:31).
2. Josiah defiled it — it became a site of burning refuse and corpses (2 Ki 23:10).
3. Jeremiah renamed it "the valley of slaughter" — where dead bodies would lie (Jer 7:32-33).
4. Isaiah 66:24 provides the defining imagery: fire and worm on corpses as an "abhorring" to all.
5. Jesus uses this imagery (gehenna + Mark 9:48 quoting Isa 66:24) as a symbol for final judgment.
6. The symbol = the consuming fire of Hinnom valley applied to eschatological judgment.

### 8.3 "Eternal Fire" = Ashes: Jude 1:7 ↔ 2 Pet 2:6

Two letters from closely related tradition both use Sodom as a judgment example:
- Jude 1:7: "suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
- 2 Pet 2:6: "turning into ashes."

The same event, the same judgment: eternal fire = turned to ashes. This is the Bible's own cross-reference for what "eternal fire" means applied to a historical judgment.

### 8.4 Mark 9:48 ↔ Isaiah 66:24 (Direct Quotation)

Cross-testament parallel hybrid score 0.424 — the top NT parallel for Isa 66:24. Mark 9:48 ("where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched") quotes Isa 66:24 directly. Isa 66:24's objects are corpses. The quotation carries the OT context into the NT use.

### 8.5 Rev 14:11 / Rev 20:10 vs. the Four "Hell" Words

The two passages most commonly cited for ECT in the NT (Rev 14:10-11 and Rev 20:10; reclassified to Neutral in etc5-18 audit) do not use any of the four "hell" words (sheol, hades, gehenna, tartaroo). They describe the lake of fire directly. This means:
- The torment language is NOT part of the semantic content of sheol, hades, gehenna, or tartaroo.
- The torment language appears separately, in Revelation's apocalyptic vision material, applied to specific entities (beast-worshippers; devil/beast/false prophet).
- The relationship between these torment passages and the destruction vocabulary of the four "hell" words is itself the contested inference (IB008).
