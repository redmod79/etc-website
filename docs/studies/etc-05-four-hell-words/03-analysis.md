## Word-by-Word Analysis

### I. SHEOL (H7585) -- All ~67 OT Occurrences

#### A. Sheol as "Grave" (KJV) -- 31 Occurrences

**Genesis 37:35; 42:38; 44:29,31** -- Jacob expects to go down to sheol in mourning for his sons. No punishment context; a righteous patriarch expects sheol as his destination. The context is grief, not judgment.

**1 Samuel 2:6** -- "The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave [sheol], and bringeth up." Sheol is described as a destination God controls. Going down and coming up are presented as divine actions. The "bringing up" from sheol suggests resurrection.

**1 Kings 2:6,9** -- David instructs Solomon about Joab and Shimei -- "let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace" and "bring thou down to the grave with blood." Sheol is used as the destination of death. The punishment is death (execution), not torment in sheol.

**Job 7:9** -- "He that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more." Sheol is permanent from the human perspective (until resurrection). No torment is described.

**Job 14:13** -- "O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave [sheol], that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past." Job requests sheol as a refuge -- a hiding place from God's wrath. This is incompatible with sheol being a place of torment.

**Job 17:13** -- "If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness." Sheol is characterized as a house of darkness and a bed -- rest, not torment.

**Job 21:13** -- "They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave." The wicked go to sheol at death. No torment is described; the point is the suddenness of death.

**Job 24:19** -- "Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned." Sheol "consumes" sinners, using destruction vocabulary (not torment vocabulary).

**Psalm 6:5** -- "For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?" Sheol is characterized by no remembrance and no thanksgiving -- unconsciousness, not torment.

**Psalm 30:3** -- "O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave." Deliverance from sheol is equated with deliverance from death. No torment context.

**Psalm 31:17** -- "Let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave." Sheol is characterized by silence.

**Psalm 49:14-15** -- "Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them... But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave." Death "feeds on" those in sheol (consumption vocabulary). Deliverance from sheol is equated with redemption -- resurrection.

**Psalm 88:3** -- "My soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave." Sheol is simply the destination of death.

**Psalm 89:48** -- "What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?" Universal: all die and go to sheol. No distinction between righteous and wicked.

**Psalm 141:7** -- "Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth." Sheol is associated with physical decomposition.

**Proverbs 1:12** -- "Let us swallow them up alive as the grave." Sheol is compared to something that consumes/swallows -- destruction vocabulary.

**Proverbs 30:16** -- "The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough." Sheol is insatiable -- it always receives more dead. No torment context.

**Ecclesiastes 9:10** -- "There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave [sheol], whither thou goest." A direct didactic description of sheol's nature: no activity, no knowledge, no wisdom. This is Solomon's characterization in Ecclesiastes.

**Song of Solomon 8:6** -- "Love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave." Sheol is a poetic figure for implacable finality.

**Hosea 13:14** -- "I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction." Sheol is equated with death. God promises to destroy sheol -- it is an enemy, not a destination designed for punishment. Paul quotes this in 1 Cor 15:55.

#### B. Sheol as "Hell" (KJV) -- 27 Occurrences

**Deuteronomy 32:22** -- "For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell [sheol]." God's anger burns to the depths of sheol. This describes the extent of divine wrath, not a description of sheol itself as a place of fire. The fire is God's anger, not sheol's characteristic.

**2 Samuel 22:6** -- "The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me." Sheol is used in poetic parallelism with death. David describes mortal danger, not afterlife torment.

**Job 11:8** -- "It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?" Heaven and sheol are used as spatial extremes (highest to lowest). No torment context.

**Job 26:6** -- "Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering." Sheol is paired with "destruction" (abaddon). God sees everything, even sheol. No torment described.

**Psalm 9:17** -- "The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God." The wicked go to sheol. The Hebrew "turned into" (shub) means to return to. Since the righteous also go to sheol (Jacob, David), the distinction is not sheol vs. non-sheol but the manner of arrival -- the wicked are sent there as judgment.

**Psalm 16:10** -- "For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [sheol]; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." A messianic psalm. Peter quotes this in Acts 2:27,31, directly substituting hades for sheol. Christ's soul was in sheol/hades between death and resurrection. Deliverance = resurrection.

**Psalm 18:5** -- "The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me." Identical context to 2 Sam 22:6. Mortal danger, not afterlife torment.

**Psalm 55:15** -- "Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell." An imprecatory prayer that enemies would die suddenly. Sheol is the destination of death.

**Psalm 86:13** -- "Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell." Deliverance from sheol = deliverance from death. No torment context.

**Psalm 116:3** -- "The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me." Sheol is paired with death in poetry. The "pains" are the pains of dying, not of afterlife torment.

**Psalm 139:8** -- "If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there." Sheol is the spatial opposite of heaven -- the deepest place. God's presence reaches both. No torment context.

**Proverbs 5:5** -- "Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell." The adulteress leads to death/sheol. The consequence is death, not torment in sheol.

**Proverbs 7:27** -- "Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death." Sheol is equated with death. "Chambers of death" describes compartments of the grave, not torture chambers.

**Proverbs 9:18** -- "But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell." The inhabitants of sheol are "the dead" (rephaim). They are dead, not tormented.

**Proverbs 15:11** -- "Hell and destruction are before the LORD." Sheol is paired with abaddon (destruction). Both are transparent to God.

**Proverbs 15:24** -- "The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath." The wise avoid premature death. Sheol is below; life is above.

**Proverbs 23:14** -- "Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell." Discipline saves the child from premature death. Sheol = death.

**Proverbs 27:20** -- "Hell and destruction are never full." Sheol and abaddon are insatiable -- they always receive more dead. No torment context.

**Isaiah 5:14** -- "Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure." Sheol is personified as swallowing the dead. Consumption/destruction vocabulary.

**Isaiah 14:9-10,15** -- "Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee... Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell." This is a mashal (taunt-poem, v.4). The rephaim "speaking" is poetic personification within an explicitly identified literary genre. Trees "rejoice" (v.8), sheol is "moved" (v.9) -- all literary devices. The passage does not constitute didactic teaching about conscious activity in sheol.

**Isaiah 28:15,18** -- "We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement... your covenant with death shall be disannulled." Sheol is personified alongside death. The people trust their treaty with death/sheol will save them. God will break it.

**Isaiah 57:9** -- "Thou wentest to the king with ointment... and didst debase thyself even unto hell." Sheol is the spatial extreme of debasement. No torment context.

**Ezekiel 31:16-17; 32:21,27** -- These prophetic lamentation passages describe nations "going down to sheol" with their armies. Ezekiel 32:21 says "the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell." This is prophetic lamentation poetry, the same genre as Isaiah 14. The "speaking" is poetic personification within prophetic dirge, not didactic description of conscious sheol activity. E32:27 specifically describes those in sheol as having "laid their swords under their heads" -- sleep/rest imagery.

**Amos 9:2** -- "Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down." Sheol and heaven are spatial extremes. No escape from God.

**Jonah 2:2** -- "Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice." Jonah uses sheol poetically for the interior of the great fish. He was alive, not dead, when he "cried from sheol." Sheol = the realm of death/near-death.

**Habakkuk 2:5** -- "Who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied." Sheol is insatiable. Paired with death. No torment context.

#### C. Sheol as "Pit" (KJV) -- 3 Occurrences

**Numbers 16:30,33** -- Korah and his company "went down alive into the pit [sheol]." They died by divine judgment -- the earth swallowed them. Sheol is the destination of their death. They "perished from among the congregation" (v.33). The text uses perishing vocabulary, not torment vocabulary.

#### D. Summary of Sheol Occurrences

Of approximately 67 sheol occurrences:
- **0 describe torment or conscious suffering in sheol in a didactic context.** Not one passage, in any genre, provides a direct didactic description of sheol as a place where the dead experience conscious torment.
- **Multiple passages describe sheol as characterized by:** silence (Ps 31:17; 115:17), darkness (Job 10:21-22; 17:13), no knowledge (Ecc 9:10), no remembrance (Ps 6:5), no praise (Ps 6:5; 88:10-12; 115:17; Isa 38:18-19), no work or wisdom (Ecc 9:10), rest (Job 3:17-18; 17:16), sleep (Job 14:12), consumption/destruction (Job 24:19; Ps 49:14; Prov 1:12; Isa 5:14).
- **Both righteous and wicked go to sheol:** Jacob (Gen 37:35), David (Ps 16:10), the wicked (Ps 9:17), Korah (Num 16:33).
- **Deliverance from sheol is equated with resurrection:** Ps 16:10; 49:15; Hos 13:14; 1 Sam 2:6.
- **Sheol is paired with "destruction" (abaddon):** Prov 15:11; 27:20; Job 26:6. The association is destruction, not torment.
- **Isaiah 14:9-10 and Ezekiel 32:21,27 use poetic personification** within identified literary genres (mashal and prophetic lamentation). These do not constitute didactic teaching about conscious activity in sheol.

### II. HADES (G86) -- All 11 NT Occurrences

**Matthew 11:23** -- "And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell [hades]." Jesus uses heaven/hades as spatial opposites (cf. Ps 139:8; Amos 9:2). Capernaum's pride will be reversed. No description of torment.

**Matthew 16:18** -- "The gates of hell [hades] shall not prevail against it [the church]." Hades is personified as a power that opposes the church. "Gates" suggests a fortress or prison. Death/hades will not overcome the church. No torment context.

**Luke 10:15** -- "And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell [hades]." Parallel to Matt 11:23. Same heaven/hades spatial contrast.

**Luke 16:23** -- "And in hell [hades] he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom." This is the only hades passage that describes conscious torment. It occurs within the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31), which follows a series of parables in Luke 15-16. The passage was classified as Neutral in etc-04 because the genre is parabolic (Tree 3, Gate 1 and Gate 3 fail). The parable's stated teaching point is "they have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them" (v.29). The imagery (Abraham's bosom, compartmentalized hades, conversations across a gulf) is not attested elsewhere in Scripture as literal afterlife geography.

**Acts 2:27** -- "Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [hades], neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." Peter quotes Psalm 16:10, substituting hades for sheol. This is the direct textual demonstration of sheol-hades equivalence. Christ's soul was in hades between death and resurrection. Deliverance from hades = resurrection. No torment described; the context is resurrection.

**Acts 2:31** -- "He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell [hades], neither his flesh did see corruption." Peter interprets Ps 16:10 as a prophecy of Christ's resurrection. Hades is the holding state between death and resurrection.

**1 Corinthians 15:55** -- "O death, where is thy sting? O grave [hades], where is thy victory?" Paul quotes Hosea 13:14. Hades is paired with death and both are defeated by resurrection. Hades = the realm of death.

**Revelation 1:18** -- "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell [hades] and of death." Christ has authority over hades and death. They are paired concepts. No torment described.

**Revelation 6:8** -- "And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell [hades] followed with him." Death and hades are personified as apocalyptic riders. They work together as paired forces of mortality. No description of torment; the context is killing.

**Revelation 20:13** -- "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell [hades] delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works." Hades gives up its dead for judgment. Hades is a temporary holding state, not a final destination.

**Revelation 20:14** -- "And death and hell [hades] were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." Hades is destroyed -- cast into the lake of fire. Hades and the lake of fire are demonstrably distinct: one is cast INTO the other. If hades were the place of eternal torment, it would not itself be destroyed.

#### Summary of Hades

Of 11 occurrences:
- **1 describes conscious torment** (Luke 16:23) -- within a parable.
- **2 describe the holding state between death and resurrection** (Acts 2:27,31).
- **1 describes hades as defeated by resurrection** (1 Cor 15:55).
- **4 personify hades alongside death** (Rev 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14).
- **2 use heaven/hades as spatial opposites** (Matt 11:23; Luke 10:15).
- **1 describes hades as unable to prevail against the church** (Matt 16:18).
- **Hades is temporary** -- it is cast into the lake of fire (Rev 20:14).
- **Hades and the lake of fire are distinct** -- one is cast into the other.

### III. GEHENNA (G1067) -- All 12 NT Occurrences

**Matthew 5:22** -- "Whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell [gehenna] fire." Jesus warns of the danger of gehenna fire. Fire is the dominant association.

**Matthew 5:29-30** -- "It is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell [gehenna]." Jesus says the body is "cast into" gehenna and "perishes" -- destruction vocabulary. The alternative to perishing is retaining the whole body. The Greek apollumi (perish) means to destroy utterly.

**Matthew 10:28** -- "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell [gehenna]." God is "able to destroy" (apolesai, from apollumi) both soul and body in gehenna. The verb is destroy, not torment. The passage states that both soul and body can be destroyed. (Already registered as E028.)

**Matthew 18:9** -- "It is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell [gehenna] fire." The alternatives are "enter into life" vs. "be cast into gehenna fire." Life is the opposite of gehenna, consistent with the life/death dichotomy in the series.

**Matthew 23:15** -- "Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell [gehenna] than yourselves." "Child of gehenna" = one destined for gehenna. Jesus addresses the Pharisees.

**Matthew 23:33** -- "Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell [gehenna]?" Jesus asks how the Pharisees can escape gehenna's judgment.

**Mark 9:43-48** -- "It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell [gehenna], into the fire that never shall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24. The Isaiah source reads: "They shall go forth, and look upon the carcases [peger] of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched." In Isaiah, the worm and fire act upon carcases (dead bodies), not living beings. The worm (skolex, maggot) is an agent of decomposition. Unquenchable fire in OT usage means fire that cannot be put out until it has consumed its fuel (cf. Jer 17:27; 2 Ki 22:17; Isa 34:10). The alternatives stated by Jesus are: "enter into life" vs. "go into gehenna." Life is the opposite of gehenna.

**Mark 9:45** -- Parallel to 9:43 with feet instead of hand.

**Mark 9:47** -- Parallel to 9:43 with eye instead of hand.

**Luke 12:5** -- "Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell [gehenna]." God kills first, then casts into gehenna. The sequence is: death, then gehenna disposal. This is consistent with Isaiah 66:24 (carcases viewed after death).

**James 3:6** -- "And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell [gehenna]." James uses gehenna figuratively for destructive fire. The tongue's destructiveness is compared to gehenna fire. This is the only non-Jesus occurrence.

#### The OT Background: Valley of Hinnom (Ge-Hinnom)

Gehenna derives from the Hebrew ge-Hinnom (Valley of the son of Hinnom), a real geographic location southwest of Jerusalem.

**Joshua 15:8; 18:16** -- Geographic boundary marker for the tribal allotments of Judah and Benjamin.

**2 Kings 23:10** -- "And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech." Josiah desecrated Topheth to prevent child sacrifice.

**2 Chronicles 28:3; 33:6** -- Kings Ahaz and Manasseh burned children there in sacrifice to Molech.

**Jeremiah 7:31-32** -- "They have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart. Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place."

**Jeremiah 19:6** -- "This place shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter."

**Jeremiah 32:35** -- "They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind."

**Isaiah 30:33** -- "For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it."

**Isaiah 66:24** -- "And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh." The subjects of the worm and fire are "carcases" (peger = dead bodies/corpses). The onlookers go forth and look upon dead bodies. This is the OT source text for Jesus' gehenna warnings in Mark 9:43-48.

The Valley of Hinnom's OT associations are: (1) a real geographic location, (2) child sacrifice to Molech, (3) prophetic cursing and renaming as "valley of slaughter" (Jer 7:32; 19:6), (4) burial until no room remains (Jer 7:32), (5) unquenchable fire consuming corpses (Isa 66:24).

#### Summary of Gehenna

Of 12 occurrences:
- **Jesus uses gehenna 11 times; James uses it once.**
- **The dominant action-word in gehenna passages is "destroy" (apollumi):** Matt 10:28 says God destroys both soul and body in gehenna. Matt 5:29-30 says body parts "perish." Luke 12:5 describes killing first, then casting into gehenna.
- **The alternative to gehenna is consistently "enter into life":** Matt 18:9; Mark 9:43,45,47. The dichotomy is life vs. gehenna (destruction), not life vs. torment.
- **Fire is the dominant imagery:** Matt 5:22 ("hell fire"); 18:9 ("hell fire"); Mark 9:43 ("fire that never shall be quenched").
- **The OT source text (Isaiah 66:24) describes corpses, not living beings.** The worm feeds on dead bodies. The fire consumes dead bodies. The onlookers view carcases.
- **No gehenna passage uses torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos, kolasis) for human beings.**
- **Gehenna differs from sheol/hades:** it is not the general abode of the dead but the place of final eschatological destruction.

### IV. TARTAROO (G5020) -- 1 NT Occurrence

**2 Peter 2:4** -- "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell [tartaroo], and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment."

**Jude 1:6** (parallel) -- "And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."

**Jude 1:7** -- "Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire." Sodom and Gomorrah are "set forth for an example" of "eternal fire." Sodom is not still burning. The fire's result (total destruction) is permanent, but the burning itself has ceased. The cities serve as an "example" visible to subsequent generations.

Observations about tartaroo:
- It is a **verb** (to cast into Tartarus), not a noun designating a place.
- It is used **only once** in the entire NT.
- It is applied **only to angels**, never to human beings.
- It describes a **temporary holding state** -- the angels are "reserved unto judgment." They have not yet received their final sentence.
- The **parallel in Jude 1:6** confirms: "reserved... unto the judgment of the great day."
- Tartarus was a Greek mythological term for the deepest part of the underworld. Peter borrows the term as his audience would understand it -- imprisonment of supernatural beings.
- **Strong's definition** of G5020 includes "to incarcerate in eternal torment," but the text itself says "reserved unto judgment," which indicates a pre-judgment holding state, not final torment.

### V. THE LAKE OF FIRE (Limne Pyros) -- Revelation Only

**Revelation 19:20** -- The beast and false prophet are cast into the lake of fire. These are symbolic entities (a beast and a false prophet), not individual human beings.

**Revelation 20:10** -- "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever." The three subjects are the devil, the beast, and the false prophet. The first is a supernatural being; the second and third are symbolic figures. "Tormented day and night for ever and ever" is applied to these three subjects. No human beings are named as subjects of this torment.

**Revelation 20:14** -- "And death and hell [hades] were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." Abstract concepts (death and hades) are cast into the lake of fire. The lake of fire IS the second death. Death and hades cannot literally be tormented -- they are destroyed.

**Revelation 20:15** -- "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." Human beings not in the book of life are cast into the lake of fire. The lake of fire has been identified as "the second death" in v.14.

**Revelation 21:8** -- "The fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." The lake of fire is again identified as "the second death" -- death terminology, not torment terminology.

The lake of fire is distinct from hades (hades is cast into it). It is identified twice as "the second death." Rev 20:10 applies torment language to the devil, beast, and false prophet, but not to human beings. When humans enter the lake of fire, the term used is "the second death" (Rev 20:14-15; 21:8).

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: The KJV Translation Conflation
The KJV translates four distinct words as "hell":
- Sheol (31 times as "grave," 27 times as "hell," 3 times as "pit")
- Hades (10 times as "hell," 1 time as "grave")
- Gehenna (11 times as "hell")
- Tartaroo (1 time as "hell")

This creates the appearance of a single concept ("hell") where the original languages have four distinct words with different semantic ranges. A reader of the KJV encounters "hell" approximately 54 times and naturally assumes a unified concept. The original texts contain:
- A general abode of all the dead (sheol/hades)
- A place of eschatological destruction associated with fire (gehenna)
- A temporary holding place for fallen angels (tartaroo)

### Pattern 2: Sheol/Hades = General Abode, Not Punishment Venue
Sheol receives both righteous (Jacob, David, Christ) and wicked. Its characteristics from didactic passages are: silence, darkness, unconsciousness, no work, no knowledge, no praise. It is paired with death and destruction (abaddon), not with torment. The LXX confirms the sheol-hades equivalence (58 of ~65 instances translated as hades). Acts 2:27,31 directly demonstrates this equivalence.

### Pattern 3: Gehenna = Destruction, Not Ongoing Torment
Gehenna passages use destruction vocabulary (apollumi: destroy, perish) rather than torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos). The alternative to gehenna is consistently "enter into life" -- the life/death dichotomy. The OT background (Valley of Hinnom) involves slaughter and corpse-disposal. The Isaiah 66:24 source text describes worms and fire acting on carcases (dead bodies).

### Pattern 4: Hades Is Temporary; Lake of Fire Is the Second Death
Hades gives up the dead and is itself cast into the lake of fire (Rev 20:13-14). The lake of fire is identified as "the second death" (Rev 20:14; 21:8). These are distinct: one is temporary, the other is final. The final state for the wicked is described with death vocabulary ("second death"), not torment vocabulary.

### Pattern 5: Tartaroo Is Unique and Limited
Tartaroo is applied only to angels. It is a holding state ("reserved unto judgment"), not a final destination. It has no direct relevance to the question of human final fate.

### Pattern 6: Torment Vocabulary Targets Non-Human or Symbolic Subjects
Rev 20:10 applies "tormented day and night for ever and ever" to three subjects: the devil, the beast, and the false prophet. The devil is a supernatural being. The beast and false prophet are symbolic entities in Revelation's apocalyptic framework. When human beings enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:15; 21:8), the identifying term is "the second death," not "torment."

## Connections Between Passages

### The Sheol-Hades-Lake of Fire Sequence
The biblical data presents a sequence: (1) Sheol/hades is the intermediate holding state for all the dead. (2) At the resurrection, hades gives up the dead for judgment (Rev 20:13). (3) After judgment, death and hades are cast into the lake of fire (Rev 20:14). (4) The wicked not in the book of life are cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death (Rev 20:15; 21:8). This sequence has three stages: death, holding (sheol/hades), and final disposition (lake of fire = second death). None of these stages is described in didactic language as conscious torment for human beings.

### The Isaiah 66:24 -- Mark 9:43-48 Connection
Jesus directly quotes Isaiah 66:24 in Mark 9:48. Isaiah 66:24 describes onlookers viewing the "carcases" of transgressors. The Hebrew peger (corpse, carcass) is used -- dead bodies, not living beings. The worm (tola'ath, a maggot) and unquenchable fire are agents of consumption acting on the dead. When Jesus applies this imagery to gehenna, the OT source determines the interpretive framework: gehenna fire acts on the dead, not on conscious beings.

### The Matt 10:28 -- Luke 12:5 Connection
Matt 10:28 says God can "destroy" (apollumi) both soul and body in gehenna. Luke 12:5 says God "after he hath killed hath power to cast into gehenna." The Lukan text specifies the sequence: killing first, then gehenna. This is consistent with Isaiah 66:24 (carcases in the fire). Gehenna is the disposal place after destruction, not a realm of ongoing conscious experience.

## Word Study Insights

### Etymology and Semantic Range
- **Sheol** (H7585): The etymology is uncertain. The word functions as the general destination of all who die. Its semantic range spans "grave," "pit," and "the unseen world of the dead." None of these meanings inherently includes torment.
- **Hades** (G86): From a- (not) + eido (to see) = "the unseen place." The etymology itself means "unseen," not "place of torment."
- **Gehenna** (G1067): From ge-Hinnom (Valley of Hinnom). The etymology is geographic: a real valley in Jerusalem. Its associations are fire, slaughter, and destruction of corpses.
- **Tartaroo** (G5020): From Greek mythology's Tartarus. Used once, for angels only.

### The LXX Translation Pattern
The LXX translates sheol as hades in 58 of ~65 instances. The remaining translations use descending vocabulary (katago, katabaino), death (thanatos), destruction (apoleia), and soul (psyche). No torment-related Greek word appears in the LXX translations of sheol. This confirms that the pre-Christian Jewish translators understood sheol/hades as the realm of the dead, not as a place of torment.

### Basanizo/Basanismos Distribution
The torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos) in eschatological contexts is concentrated in Revelation: Rev 14:10-11 and Rev 20:10. Rev 20:10 applies it to the devil, beast, and false prophet. Rev 14:10-11 applies it to those who worship the beast -- but the smoke "ascends forever," not the torment itself. The word basanizo also means sickness (Matt 8:6), wave-tossing (Matt 14:24), moral distress (2 Pet 2:8), and childbirth pain (Rev 12:2).

## Difficult Passages

### Isaiah 14:9-10 -- Do the Dead Speak in Sheol?
The passage depicts the rephaim (shades) "speaking" when the king of Babylon arrives in sheol. However, Isaiah 14:4 explicitly identifies this as a mashal (proverb/taunt-poem). Within this same poem, trees "rejoice" (v.8), sheol is "moved" (v.9). These are standard Hebrew poetic personification devices. The didactic descriptions of sheol (Ecc 9:10; Ps 6:5; 115:17) characterize it as a place of no knowledge, no work, no praise, and silence. The literary genre (mashal) governs the reading.

### Ezekiel 32:21,27 -- Warriors in Sheol
Ezekiel 32:21 says "the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell." This is within a prophetic lamentation (qinah). Verse 27 describes those in sheol with "their swords under their heads" -- they are lying down with their weapons, not in active torment. The genre is prophetic dirge, not didactic teaching.

### Luke 16:23 -- Conscious Torment in Hades?
The only hades passage describing conscious torment. Classified Neutral in etc-04 because: (a) it is a parable (Gate 1 and Gate 3 of Tree 3 fail), (b) "Abraham's bosom" as a location for the dead is not attested elsewhere in Scripture, (c) compartmentalized hades with conversations across a gulf is not described in any didactic passage, (d) the parable's own teaching point is "they have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them" (v.29).

### Revelation 20:10 -- Tormented Forever?
Three subjects are tormented: the devil, the beast, and the false prophet. The devil is a supernatural being. The beast and false prophet are symbolic entities unique to Revelation's apocalyptic framework. When human beings are cast into the same lake of fire (Rev 20:15; 21:8), the term used is "the second death," not "torment." The question of whether Rev 20:10's language extends to humans is examined in depth in a later study (etc-08 on aionios/duration).

### Revelation 14:10-11 -- Smoke Ascending Forever?
"The smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night." The subjects are those who worship the beast. This passage uses Babylon-destruction imagery from Isaiah 34:10 (Edom), where the smoke ascends forever but the land becomes desolate (not perpetually burning). The "no rest day nor night" applies to worshippers of the beast during the period described, paralleling the four living creatures who "rest not day and night" (Rev 4:8) -- the same Greek phrase. *(Examined in depth in etc-08 on aionios/duration.)*
