# Conclusion
## Study: etc5-05 — Four "Hell" Words (Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, Tartaroo)

**Question:** English Bibles translate several different words as "hell." What are the original Hebrew and Greek words? Examine sheol (H7585), hades (G86), gehenna (G1067), and tartaroo (G5020). What is the semantic range of each? Are they interchangeable? Do any of them inherently mean a place of eternal conscious torment?

---

## Summary Answer

The KJV's single English word "hell" translates four distinct terms: sheol (H7585, OT), hades (G86, NT), gehenna (G1067, NT), and tartaroo (G5020, NT). These four terms describe different realities at different points in the eschatological sequence and are not interchangeable.

**Sheol** is the OT term for the realm of all the dead — righteous and wicked alike. It is characterized by silence, darkness, inactivity, and the absence of consciousness. Neither righteous nor wicked persons are described as experiencing torment in sheol.

**Hades** is the NT equivalent of sheol — the LXX translates sheol as hades 58 times (PMI 33.87), and NT writers quote OT sheol passages using hades. Hades is a temporary holding state that receives the dead, holds them until the resurrection-judgment, delivers them up, and is then itself destroyed — cast into the lake of fire (Rev 20:14).

**Gehenna** is the NT symbol for final eschatological judgment, derived from the Valley of Hinnom. Its 12 NT occurrences are all eschatological, none referring to the literal valley. The key verb describing what happens in gehenna is apollumi (to destroy — Matt 10:28). The source imagery (Isa 66:24) depicts the worm and fire acting on corpses (pigrê), not conscious persons. The torment vocabulary (βασανισμός) is absent from all 12 gehenna passages.

**Tartaroo** is a verb (hapax legomenon, single occurrence) applied only to fallen angels, describing their pre-judgment confinement in "chains of darkness" until the judgment. It has no direct application to human fate.

None of the four terms inherently means "a place of eternal conscious torment." The explicit torment vocabulary in NT eschatology (Rev 14:10-11; Rev 20:10) appears separately from all four "hell" words, applied to specific entities (beast-worshippers in a tribulation context; the devil, beast, and false prophet).

## Key Verses

1. **Matthew 10:28** — "Fear him which is able to destroy [apollumi] both soul and body in hell [gehenna]." The word used for what happens in gehenna is "destroy," not "torment." (E026)
2. **Revelation 20:13-14** — Hades delivers up the dead for judgment, then is cast into the lake of fire. Hades ends; the lake of fire is distinct. (E110, N026)
3. **Acts 2:27, 31** — Peter quotes Ps 16:10 using hades, proving sheol = hades across the testaments. (E131, E135)
4. **Isaiah 66:24** — The source text of the gehenna imagery: "their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched" — the objects are pigrê (corpses, dead bodies). (E141)
5. **Jude 1:7 + 2 Peter 2:6** — Sodom's "eternal fire" (Jude) = "turned to ashes" (2 Pet). The biblical self-definition of "eternal fire" as permanent result, not ongoing process. (E147, N029, reclassified to IB009-resolved after Study 5)
6. **2 Peter 2:4** — Tartaroo applies only to fallen angels in pre-judgment "chains of darkness." (E145, E146)
7. **Revelation 20:10** — The devil, beast, and false prophet are tormented "day and night for ever and ever." The strongest ongoing-torment passage in the NT. (E149)
8. **Revelation 14:10-11** — Beast-worshippers tormented with fire; smoke ascends "for ever and ever." (E150)

## Full Analysis

### The Translation Problem

The KJV renders four distinct terms as "hell":
- H7585 (sheol): ~62 of 67 occurrences are rendered as "hell," "grave," or "pit"
- G86 (hades): 11 occurrences rendered as "hell" (×10) or "grave" (×1)
- G1067 (gehenna): 12 occurrences all rendered as "hell"
- G5020 (tartaroo): 1 occurrence rendered as "hell"

This translation collapse produces a unified English concept where the original texts use four distinct terms with different scopes. The KJV itself acknowledges the range by rendering the same H7585 (sheol) as "grave" in narrative and wisdom contexts (Genesis, Job, Ecclesiastes) and "hell" in poetic and prophetic contexts (Isaiah, Deuteronomy, Psalms 86:13). When the KJV translators use "grave" and "hell" for the same word, they implicitly acknowledge that the word does not inherently mean eternal conscious torment.

### Sheol and Hades: The Same Concept Across Two Testaments

The LXX equation (58/67 occurrences, PMI 33.87) demonstrates that the Greek-speaking Jewish translators understood sheol and hades as referring to the same reality. The NT writers confirm this through direct quotation:
- Acts 2:27 quotes Ps 16:10 (sheol → hades)
- 1 Corinthians 15:55 quotes Hosea 13:14 (sheol → hades)

The semantic range of hades in the NT inherits the full OT range of sheol: the realm of all the dead, holding them between death and resurrection, with no inherent torment vocabulary.

**Hades receives both righteous and wicked:** Christ's soul was in hades (Acts 2:31). David's soul was in sheol/hades (Ps 16:10, Acts 2:29). Jacob expected to go to sheol (Gen 37:35). The distinction is not between righteous-sheol and wicked-sheol; it is between hades (temporary) and the lake of fire (post-judgment final fate).

**Hades is temporary:** Rev 20:13 — hades delivers up the dead. Rev 20:14 — hades is cast into the lake of fire and destroyed. The abolition of hades at the final judgment means hades cannot be the final, eternal destination of the wicked.

### Gehenna: Destruction Vocabulary, Not Torment Vocabulary

All 12 NT gehenna passages associate the term with fire and with apollumi (destroy), not with the torment vocabulary. The vocabulary analysis:

- The word βασανισμός (torment) does not appear in any of the 12 gehenna passages.
- The verb used for what God does in gehenna (Matt 10:28) is apollumi (Aorist Active Infinitive) = "to destroy completely/cause to perish."
- The fire imagery derives from Isaiah 66:24 (corpses consumed by worm and fire) and the Valley of Hinnom (a burning dump).
- The "eternal fire" descriptor (Matt 18:8; Matt 25:41; Jude 1:7) is defined by Scripture itself through the Sodom cross-reference (Jude 1:7 = eternal fire; 2 Pet 2:6 = ashes): eternal fire means permanent destructive result, not ongoing burning.

The destruction vocabulary is consistent across the parallel passage at Luke 12:5 (synoptic of Matt 10:28) and across all non-metaphorical gehenna references.

### Tartaroo: Strictly Limited in Scope

The single NT occurrence of tartaroo (2 Pet 2:4) cannot bear doctrinal weight for human post-mortem experience:
- It applies only to angels.
- It describes pre-judgment custody, not final punishment.
- Its characterization is "chains of darkness," not fire or torment.
- It is a verb (not a noun), used once, never applied to humans.

Any doctrinal claim about human experience derived from tartaroo requires extending the term beyond its stated scope.

### The Torment Passages (Rev 14:10-11 and Rev 20:10)

These two passages contain explicit textual content (E149, E150) and must be examined directly. [Note: E149 and E150 were reclassified from ECT to Neutral in the etc5-18 audit — see reclassification notes.]

**Revelation 14:10-11:** Beast-worshippers — those who take the mark of the beast — are tormented with fire and brimstone; the smoke of their torment ascends "for ever and ever." This is an angelic warning vision during the tribulation sequence (chapters 12-16). The subjects are those who specifically worship the beast and receive his mark.

**Revelation 20:10:** The devil, beast, and false prophet are tormented "day and night for ever and ever" in the lake of fire. The specific subjects named are these three entities.

These passages are ECT E items. What they explicitly state:
- The three named entities (devil, beast, false prophet) face ongoing torment.
- Beast-worshippers face torment with fire, smoke ascending "for ever and ever."

What these passages do NOT state:
- That the ongoing torment description applies to all persons in the lake of fire (Rev 20:15 uses "cast into," not "tormented").
- That gehenna = the same experience as the lake of fire's torment passages.

The relationship between these torment-language passages and the destruction vocabulary of the four "hell" words remains a contested inference (IB008).

| E19 | **E142** | The verb used with gehenna in Matthew 10:28 is ἀπολέσαι (G622 apollumi, Aorist Active Infinitive) = "to destroy/perish completely" — not βασανίζω (to torment) or κολάζω (to punish). | Matt 10:28 (Greek morphology) | Neutral |

| E21 | **E144** | Mark 9:43-48 — the refrain "where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" (vv.44,46,48) is a direct quotation of Isaiah 66:24 (cross-testament parallel hybrid score 0.424). | Mark 9:48; Isa 66:24 | Neutral |

| E26 | **E149** | The devil, beast, and false prophet are "tormented day and night for ever and ever" in the lake of fire. Subjects are three named entities; beast/false prophet are symbolic (Rev 17:8,11 = apoleia). Book's genre: esēmainō (Rev 1:1).

### Necessary Implications

| Study # | Master ID | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why unavoidable | Classification |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| N1 | N026 | Hades is a temporary holding state: (a) receives the dead, (b) holds them until judgment, (c) delivers them up, (d) is itself destroyed. | E131, E134, E110 | Three independent statements without added concepts: soul in hades until resurrection (Acts 2:31), hades delivers up dead at judgment (Rev 20:13), hades abolished (Rev 20:14). | Conditionalist |
| N2 | N021 | The second death IS the lake of fire, by explicit textual identification. | E110, E113 | Both Rev 20:14 and Rev 21:8 provide the definition "this IS the second death." | Conditionalist |
| N3 | N023 | The dead lack consciousness, thought, knowledge, praise, and activity — consistently across multiple independent authors. | E017, E019, E013, E014, E015, E016, E022, E020, E021 | Multiple independent witnesses (Qohelet, Psalmists, Job, Isaiah) with unqualified negative statements. | Conditionalist |
| N4 | **N027** | Sheol and hades refer to the same reality across the two testaments. | E138, E131, E135 | The LXX translates sheol as hades 58/67 times (E138); NT writers quote OT sheol passages using hades and treat them as referring to the same state (Acts 2:27/Ps 16:10 at E131/E135; 1 Cor 15:55/Hos 13:14). The correspondence is confirmed by both the translators' word choice and the NT writers' exegetical application. Both sides must acknowledge the lexical equivalence. | Neutral |
| N5 | **N028** | Gehenna and sheol/hades are distinct terms describing different stages in the eschatological sequence: sheol/hades = pre-judgment state of the dead; gehenna = post-judgment final fate. | N026, E110, Matt 10:28 (E026), all 12 gehenna passages | N026 establishes hades as temporary and pre-judgment. Rev 20:13-14 establishes the sequence: hades delivers up → judgment → hades destroyed. The gehenna passages uniformly describe eschatological judgment outcomes, not the current state of the dead. No interpretation is required to see that these are different moments in the sequence; it follows directly from the temporal content of each group of passages. | Neutral |
| N6 | **N029** | "Eternal fire" in biblical usage (as defined by the Bible's own cross-reference) denotes a fire whose result is permanent and irrevocable, not a fire that continues burning forever. | E147 | Jude 1:7 calls Sodom's judgment "eternal fire"; 2 Pet 2:6 (same letter-tradition) calls the same event "turned to ashes." These two statements by the same author about the same event provide the Bible's working definition. The conclusion follows without added concepts: if the eternal fire on Sodom = ashes, "eternal" modifies the permanence of the result, not the ongoing process of burning. | Neutral |
> **[RECLASSIFIED]** N029 was reclassified from Neutral (N-tier) to I-B Conditionalist direction (STRONG), subsumed by IB009, after Study 5. All prose references to N029 should be read as IB009-resolved (formerly N029).

### Inferences

#### I-A (Evidence-Extending)

| Study # | Master ID | Claim | E/N Basis | Why inference | Classification |
|---------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| IA1 | IA005 | The state of the dead is one of complete unawareness — no thought, knowledge, praise — until the resurrection. | E013, E017-E019, E020-E022, E014-E016, N009 | Systematizes multiple E/N items into a positive claim about the absence of any continuing consciousness. No single verse states this as a comprehensive claim. | Conditionalist |
| IA2 | IA013 | The second death is actual death — final and irreversible destruction — rather than ongoing conscious torment. | E110, E111, E026, E114, E116, E117, N021, N022 | Systematizes destruction vocabulary (apollumi, olethros) from multiple passages; the name "death" itself is incorporated as evidence. No single verse states "the second death is annihilation." | Conditionalist |
| IA3 | **IA016** | The four "hell" words (sheol, hades, gehenna, tartaroo) describe distinct realities that are not interchangeable, and none of the four terms inherently carries the semantic content of "eternal conscious torment." | E137-E148, N027, N028 (this study); N026, N023 (prior studies) | Systematizes the word-study data for four separate lexical items into a comparative vocabulary conclusion. No single verse states "these terms are distinct and non-synonymous." | Conditionalist |
| IA4 | **IA017** | Because the source text of the Mark 9 gehenna imagery (Isa 66:24) depicts fire and worm acting on corpses, the gehenna fire-imagery in Mark 9 is grounded in the complete destruction of those who are already dead, rather than the ongoing torment of conscious persons. | E141 (Isa 66:24 objects = corpses), E144 (Mark 9:48 quotes Isa 66:24), E026 (apollumi in Matt 10:28), E143 (torment vocabulary absent) | Combines E141 + E144 + E026 + E143 into an interpretive claim about what the gehenna imagery implies. The OT source's context (corpses) is brought into the NT quotation to characterize the imagery as destruction-grounded. Requires inferring that the OT corpse-context governs the NT use of the imagery. | Conditionalist |

#### I-B (Competing Evidence)

| Study # | Master ID | Claim | FOR | AGAINST | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|-------|-----|---------|------------|
| IB1 | IB001 | A conscious intermediate state exists for the righteous between death and resurrection. | E038, E039, E050, E051, E052, E123 | N023, N026, E017, E020, E130, E131, E124, N025 | **Moderate — weight AGAINST** (established in etc5-04; no revision needed from this study) |
| IB2 | IB006 | Luke 16:19-31 is a literal historical account of the intermediate state. | E123 (rich man conscious in hades, in torment, communicating) | Parabolic context (series of Lucan parables); primary message = sufficiency of Scripture (v.31); conflict with N026, N023; genre-determining step is the inference | **Unresolved** (no change from etc5-03/04) |
| IB3 | **IB008** | The ongoing torment language applied to the devil, beast, false prophet (Rev 20:10), and beast-worshippers (Rev 14:10-11) applies universally to all persons in the lake of fire. | E149 (Rev 20:10: devil/beast/false prophet tormented forever); E150 (Rev 14:10-11: beast-worshippers tormented, smoke forever); Both use explicit "for ever and ever" language | Rev 20:15 casts humans into the lake of fire without adding torment language; the three specifically named entities in Rev 20:10 are supernatural figures; Rev 14:10-11 specifies a defined group (beast-worshippers in the tribulation context); the four "hell" words consistently use destruction rather than torment vocabulary (N028, IA016, E026, E142, E143); the named subjects differ from the general "whosoever was not found written" (Rev 20:15) | **Moderate — weight AGAINST universal extension.** E149 and E150 are genuine ECT explicit statements. Rev 20:15 adds the general human case without repeating the torment language. The text explicitly names specific subjects for the ongoing torment (three entities in 20:10; a defined group in 14:10-11). Extending the same language to all in the lake without textual basis requires step beyond what is stated. SIS #4a: Rev 20:15 (immediately following Rev 20:10 in same passage, same author) casts humans in without torment language — the adjacent verse governs scope. |

## I-B Resolution Sections

### IB008 — New Item: Universal Extension of Rev 20:10 Torment Language

**Step 1 — Identify the tension:**
Revelation 20:10 states that the devil, beast, and false prophet are tormented "day and night for ever and ever" in the lake of fire. Revelation 14:10-11 states that beast-worshippers are tormented with fire, their smoke ascending "for ever and ever." Both are genuine explicit statements.

The tension: these passages use ongoing torment language, while the four "hell" words and the destruction vocabulary (apollumi, olethros) consistently describe destruction/death. Rev 20:15 casts the general human wicked into the lake of fire with no added torment language.

**Step 2 — Assess clarity:**
The torment language in Rev 14:10-11 and Rev 20:10 is clear and explicit as written. The question is not about the clarity of these verses themselves but about the scope of their application: do they describe the experience of all persons in the lake of fire, or of the specific entities named?

**Step 3 — Count and weigh:**
- FOR universal extension: E149 (devil/beast/false prophet tormented forever), E150 (beast-worshippers tormented forever). Two passages using torment language. [Note: reclassified to Neutral in etc5-18 audit.]
- AGAINST universal extension: Rev 20:15 (humans cast in, no torment language added in same passage); the four "hell" words' consistent destruction vocabulary (N028, E026, E142, E143); the destruction/death vocabulary in 2 Th 1:9 (E116), Matt 10:28 (E026), John 3:16 (E114); the named subjects in both passages are specific entities or groups.

**Step 4 — Apply SIS:**
SIS #4a (same author, same passage, adjacent verse): Rev 20:10 names the devil/beast/false prophet; Rev 20:15 (same vision, same author, next verse) casts the human wicked into the lake of fire without adding "tormented day and night for ever and ever." If the ongoing torment description applied universally to all in the lake, the adjacent verse would be the natural place to confirm it. The author instead uses "cast into" without the torment language.

**Step 5 — State resolution:**
**Moderate — weight AGAINST universal extension.** The ongoing torment language in Rev 14:10-11 and Rev 20:10 is textually specific to named entities and defined groups; its extension to all persons in the lake requires inferring beyond the text's stated subjects. The adjacent verse in the same passage (Rev 20:15) does not extend the torment language to the general human wicked. The consistent destruction vocabulary of the four "hell" words and parallel eschatological passages works against universal torment as the framework for all in the lake of fire.

## Positional Tally

### New This Study (etc5-05)

| Category | Conditionalist | ECT | Neutral | Total |
|----------|---------------|-----|---------|-------|
| E (Explicit) | 2 | 0 | 12 | 14 |
| N (Necessary Impl.) | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| I-A | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| I-B (new) | — | — | 1 new item | 1 |
| I-C | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| I-D | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Subtotal new** | **4** | **0** | **14** | **18 new** |

Note: The 2 new Conditionalist E items are E140 and E148. E149 and E150 were reclassified from ECT to Neutral in the etc5-18 audit (grammar, context, and harmony with other E-items: E149's subjects are symbolic entities whose destiny is apoleia/destruction per Rev 17:8,11; same formula = cessation in Rev 19:3; E150's grammar shows "for ever" attaches to smoke, not persons — E211). The 12 Neutral E items are E137-E139, E141-E147, E149, E150. N029 (originally counted as 1 of 3 new Neutral N items) was reclassified to I-B Conditionalist direction (STRONG), subsumed by IB009; it is no longer counted in the N-tier.

### Running Master Totals After etc5-05

| Category | Conditionalist | ECT | Neutral | Total |
|----------|---------------|-----|---------|-------|
| E (Explicit) | 84 | 6 | 60 | **150** |
| N (Necessary Impl.) | 22 | 0 | 6 | **28** |
| I-A | 15 | 0 | 2 | **17** |

**Simplified tally:**
- Conditionalist items (E+N): 84 + 22 = **106**
- ECT items (E+I-D): 6 + 3 = **9**
- Neutral items (E+N): 60 + 6 = **66**
- Inferences (I-A): 17 (15 Conditionalist, 2 Neutral)
- Inferences (I-B): 8 total (IB001-IB008); 6 resolved Moderate (IB001-IB003, IB005, IB007, IB008), 2 Unresolved (IB004, IB006)
- I-C: 2 (Conditionalist)
- I-D: 3 (ECT)

## What CAN Be Said

From the explicit statements and necessary implications of this study:

1. **The KJV's single word "hell" translates four distinct original terms with different scopes, different temporal referents, and different associated vocabularies.** The translation collapse is a demonstrable textual fact (E137).

2. **Sheol and hades are the same concept across the two testaments**, confirmed by the LXX translation data (58/67 occurrences, PMI 33.87 — E138) and direct NT quotation of OT sheol passages using hades (E131, E135, N027).

3. **Both righteous and wicked persons go to sheol/hades.** Jacob, David, and Job anticipated going to sheol; the wicked also go there. Sheol is the universal realm of the dead, not an exclusively wicked destination (E139).

4. **Sheol/hades is a temporary state** that delivers up the dead at the resurrection-judgment and is then itself destroyed (N026, E134, E110). Hades is not the final eternal destination.

5. **The key verb describing what happens in gehenna is apollumi (destroy), not basanizo (torment)** — the explicit statement of Matt 10:28 (E026, E142).

6. **The torment vocabulary (βασανισμός) is absent from all 12 gehenna passages** — a demonstrable lexical fact (E143).

7. **The source text of the gehenna fire imagery (Isa 66:24, quoted directly in Mark 9:48) depicts fire and worm acting on pigrê — corpses, dead bodies, not conscious persons** (E141, E144).

8. **"Eternal fire" on Sodom produced ashes** — the Bible's own cross-reference (Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6) defines "eternal fire" as permanently destructive result, not ongoing burning process (E147, N029, reclassified to IB009-resolved after Study 5).

9. **Tartaroo applies only to fallen angels in pre-judgment confinement in "chains of darkness"** — it cannot be applied to human experience (E145, E146).

10. **Explicit ongoing torment language ("tormented for ever and ever") appears in Rev 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers) and Rev 20:10 (devil, beast, false prophet)** — these passages use torment vocabulary (E149, E150, reclassified to Neutral in etc5-18 audit: subjects are symbolic entities or specific class; grammar of E211 shows "for ever" attaches to smoke; same formula = cessation in Rev 19:3). Neither passage uses the word gehenna.

## What CANNOT Be Said

From the explicit statements and necessary implications:

1. **"Sheol inherently means a place of torment."** The OT texts consistently present sheol as characterized by silence, inactivity, rest, and darkness. The righteous expected to go there without any description of torment.

2. **"Hades is eternal."** Rev 20:14 explicitly states hades is cast into the lake of fire — hades ends. Any claim that hades = eternal conscious torment conflicts with the explicit statement that hades is destroyed.

3. **"Gehenna means eternal conscious torment."** No single gehenna passage uses torment vocabulary. The definitive passage (Matt 10:28) uses apollumi (destroy). The source imagery (Isa 66:24) operates on corpses.

4. **"Tartaroo describes the fate of the wicked."** The word occurs once, applies only to angels, and describes pre-judgment temporary confinement in darkness — not fire, not torment, and not a human experience.

5. **"The four 'hell' words are interchangeable synonyms."** Sheol = hades (proven); gehenna ≠ sheol/hades (different temporal stage); tartaroo ≠ any of the others (different subject, different purpose, different characterization).

6. **"The ongoing torment of Rev 20:10 is explicitly stated to apply to all persons in the lake of fire."** Rev 20:10 names three specific entities; Rev 20:15 adds the general human case without repeating the torment language. The extension of the torment language to all in the lake is an inference beyond the text's stated subjects (IB008 — Moderate weight against universal extension).

7. **"The unquenchable fire of Mark 9 / Matt 3:12 means a fire that burns forever."** The word asbestos means "cannot be prematurely extinguished"; Matt 3:12 says the chaff is "burned up" (katakaisei = burned completely) by the unquenchable fire. The fire is unquenchable because it burns to completion.
