# Four Hell Words -- Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, Tartaroo

## Question
Semantic range of Sheol (H7585), Hades (G86), Gehenna (G1067), Tartaroo (G5020). Interchangeability? Does any inherently mean eternal torment? LXX translation patterns.

## Summary Answer
The KJV translates four distinct Hebrew/Greek words as "hell," creating the appearance of a single unified concept. Sheol (H7585, ~67 OT occurrences) and hades (G86, 11 NT occurrences) are semantically equivalent (confirmed by the LXX translating sheol as hades 58 times and by Acts 2:27,31 directly quoting Ps 16:10). Both designate the general abode of all the dead (righteous and wicked), characterized in didactic passages by silence, darkness, unconsciousness, and no activity (Ecc 9:10; Ps 6:5; 115:17; Job 10:21-22). Gehenna (G1067, 12 NT occurrences) derives from the Valley of Hinnom (ge-Hinnom), a site of child sacrifice cursed by Jeremiah as "the valley of slaughter" (Jer 7:32; 19:6). Jesus uses gehenna for eschatological destruction, stating God can "destroy both soul and body in gehenna" (Matt 10:28), and quoting Isaiah 66:24, which describes worms and fire acting on corpses. Gehenna passages use destruction vocabulary (apollumi), not torment vocabulary (basanizo). Tartaroo (G5020, 1 NT occurrence) is a verb applied exclusively to fallen angels, describing temporary imprisonment "reserved unto judgment" (2 Pet 2:4). No word among the four inherently means "eternal torment" based on its semantic range, etymology, LXX translation pattern, or biblical usage.

## Key Verses
- **Acts 2:27,31** -- Peter quotes Ps 16:10 (sheol) using hades, confirming equivalence: "thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [hades], neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption"
- **Ecclesiastes 9:10** -- "There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave [sheol], whither thou goest"
- **Matthew 10:28** -- "Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell [gehenna]"
- **Mark 9:43-48** -- "Go into hell [gehenna], into the fire that never shall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" (quoting Isa 66:24)
- **Isaiah 66:24** -- "They shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched"
- **Revelation 20:13-14** -- "Death and hell [hades] delivered up the dead... and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
- **2 Peter 2:4** -- "God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell [tartaroo], and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment"
- **Psalm 6:5** -- "In death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave [sheol] who shall give thee thanks?"
- **Luke 12:5** -- "Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell [gehenna]"

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Sheol and hades are semantically equivalent, designating the same concept: the realm/state of the dead | E2 (LXX translates sheol as hades 58x), E3 (Acts 2:27,31 directly quotes Ps 16:10 substituting hades for sheol) | Neutral | The LXX overwhelmingly translates one as the other (58/65), and Peter's sermon directly demonstrates the equivalence. No reader can deny the words refer to the same concept. | N019 (updated) |
| N2 | Sheol/hades is the common destination of all the dead (righteous and wicked), not a punishment venue for the wicked only | E4 (Jacob, David, wicked, Korah all go to sheol), E3 (Christ's soul was in hades) | Neutral | Righteous persons (Jacob, David, Christ) and wicked persons (Ps 9:17, Korah) all go to sheol/hades. This is not a wicked-only destination. | N019 (updated) |
| N3 | Sheol/hades is characterized by unconsciousness, not conscious activity, in didactic passages | E5 (Ecc 9:10: no work/knowledge/wisdom), E6 (Ps 6:5: no remembrance), E7 (Ps 115:17: silence), E8 (Ps 88:10-12: forgetfulness), E10 (Job 10:21-22: darkness), E11 (Job 17:13: bed in darkness) | Cond. | Six didactic passages from four different authors describe sheol as a place of no activity, no knowledge, silence, darkness, and forgetfulness. No didactic passage describes sheol as a place of conscious activity. | N004 (updated) |
| N4 | Gehenna and sheol/hades are distinct concepts: gehenna is eschatological destruction; sheol/hades is the general abode of all the dead | E30 (Matt 10:28: God destroys in gehenna), E23 (Rev 20:13-14: hades is temporary, cast into lake of fire), E36-E38 (gehenna derives from Valley of Hinnom with destruction/slaughter associations), E4 (both righteous and wicked go to sheol) | Neutral | Gehenna has destruction/fire associations and is eschatological; sheol/hades receives all the dead and is temporary. They function differently. Both sides accept this distinction. | N022 *NEW* |
| N5 | Hades is temporary, not the final state: it delivers up the dead and is cast into the lake of fire | E23 (Rev 20:13-14) | Neutral | Rev 20:13-14 directly states hades delivers up the dead and is cast into the lake of fire. | N020 |
| N6 | Hades and the lake of fire are distinct: one is cast into the other | E47 (Rev 20:14: hades cast INTO lake of fire) | Neutral | If A is cast into B, A and B are not the same thing. Both sides accept this. | N023 *NEW* |
| N7 | Tartaroo applies only to angels, not to humans | E42 (2 Pet 2:4: used once, for angels only), E43 (context is "angels that sinned"), E44 (Jude 1:6 parallel: "angels which kept not their first estate") | Neutral | Both texts specify the subjects as angels. No text applies tartaroo to humans. Both sides accept this. | N024 *NEW* |
| N8 | The OT background of gehenna (Valley of Hinnom) involves slaughter, corpse disposal, and destruction -- not ongoing torment of the living | E37 (child sacrifice), E38 (renamed "valley of slaughter"; burial till no room), E35 (Isa 66:24: corpses consumed by worm and fire) | Neutral | The historical Valley of Hinnom was a place where people died (child sacrifice, then prophetically: slaughter and burial). Isaiah 66:24 describes corpses. Both sides accept the historical background. | N025 *NEW* |
| N9 | The KJV translation of four distinct words as one English word ("hell") obscures their different semantic ranges | E1 (sheol translated "grave" 31x and "hell" 27x), E2 (LXX confirms sheol=hades), E36 (gehenna from ge-Hinnom), E42 (tartaroo = verb for angel-imprisonment) | Neutral | When four words with different meanings are all rendered "hell," the English reader cannot distinguish them. Both sides recognize this translation issue. | N026 *NEW* |

**N-tier verification (3-question test applied to each):**

- **N1/N019:** (1) Both ECT and Conditionalist scholars agree the LXX translates sheol as hades and that Peter demonstrates this. YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N2/N019:** (1) Both sides agree both righteous and wicked go to sheol. YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N3/N004:** (1) An ECT scholar would acknowledge these texts describe sheol as a place of no work, knowledge, praise, etc. The scholar would qualify these statements (e.g., "from the earthly perspective"). The N-item states what the combined texts say. Positional classification is because one side must qualify these statements to maintain their position. (2) The texts state one thing. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| I1 | Sheol/hades is a place of conscious existence, possibly with distinct compartments for the righteous and wicked | I-B | ECT-direction | FOR: E28/E155 (Luke 16:23: rich man conscious in hades), E19/E171 (Isa 14:9-10: rephaim "speak" in sheol), E20/E183 (Ezek 32:21: mighty "speak" in sheol). AGAINST: E5/E021 (Ecc 9:10: no work/knowledge/wisdom in sheol), E6/E017 (Ps 6:5: no remembrance), E7/E018 (Ps 115:17: silence), E8/E044 (Ps 88:10-12: forgetfulness), E10/E145 (Job 10:21-22: darkness), E11/E146 (Job 17:13: bed in darkness), E12/E144 (Job 7:9-10: come up no more). Also: E19/E171 is a mashal (taunt-poem, v.4); E20/E183 is prophetic lamentation. | The FOR evidence comes from one parable (Luke 16:23, which fails Tree 3 Gates 1 and 3) and two poetic/literary passages (Isa 14, identified as mashal; Ezek 32, prophetic lamentation). The AGAINST evidence comes from six didactic passages across four authors. The claim requires treating parabolic and poetic personification as didactic descriptions of sheol's nature, contradicting the didactic passages. | #2 (choosing between parabolic/poetic vs. didactic descriptions), #3 (importing parabolic imagery as literal geography) |
| I2 | Gehenna is a place of eternal conscious torment for the wicked | I-B | ECT-direction | FOR: E34/E127 (Mark 9:43-48: fire that never shall be quenched; worm dieth not). AGAINST: E30/E028 (Matt 10:28: God destroys both soul and body in gehenna -- destroy, not torment), E31/E189 (Matt 5:29-30: members perish, apollumi), E33/E191 (Luke 12:5: God kills first, then casts into gehenna), E35/E192 (Isa 66:24: the source text describes carcases/corpses, not living beings), E40/E197 (no gehenna passage uses torment vocabulary for humans). | The FOR evidence cites "fire that never shall be quenched" and "worm dieth not" from Mark 9:43-48. But the OT source (Isa 66:24) explicitly describes these as acting on "carcases" (peger = dead bodies). Jesus himself chose this OT quotation. The other gehenna passages use destruction vocabulary (apollumi: destroy, perish), not torment vocabulary. No gehenna passage applies basanizo, basanismos, or kolasis to human beings. The claim requires reading "unquenchable fire" as meaning "fire that torments forever" when the OT source and NT vocabulary both point to destruction. | #2 (choosing between destruction and torment readings of fire/worm imagery), #4b (importing torment concept when apollumi/peger point to destruction) |
| I3 | Revelation 20:10 teaches that all the wicked will be tormented forever in the lake of fire | I-C | ECT-direction | E48/E125 (Rev 20:10: the devil, beast, and false prophet are tormented day and night for ever and ever). E49/E204 (when humans enter the lake of fire in Rev 20:15 and 21:8, the term used is "the second death"). E50/E205 (the beast and false prophet are symbolic entities). The text specifies three subjects: the devil, the beast, and the false prophet. Rev 20:15 and 21:8 describe human entry into the lake of fire as "the second death." | The claim extends torment language from three named subjects (devil, beast, false prophet) to all human beings cast into the lake of fire. The text itself does not make this extension -- when it describes human fate, it uses "the second death" (death vocabulary), not "torment" vocabulary. The claim requires importing the concept that what happens to three named symbolic/supernatural subjects automatically applies to all unnamed human beings. | #3 (external framework: extending symbolic/supernatural subjects to all humans), #4b (cross-referencing without verified textual connection between the three subjects' fate and human fate) |
| I4 | The "four hell words" describe a unified concept of eternal conscious torment | I-D | ECT | E1/E177 (KJV translates all four as "hell"), E2/E178 (LXX confirms sheol=hades), N4/N022 (gehenna and sheol/hades are distinct), N7/N024 (tartaroo applies only to angels), E5/E021 (sheol characterized by unconsciousness), E23/E123 (hades is temporary), E30/E028 (gehenna uses destruction vocabulary), E42/E199 (tartaroo is for angels). The four words have distinct semantic ranges, distinct subjects, and distinct temporal scopes. Treating them as one concept requires the KJV translation choice to override the original languages. | The claim requires overriding multiple E/N statements: sheol/hades is the abode of ALL the dead (not punishment), gehenna uses destruction vocabulary (not torment), tartaroo applies to angels (not humans), hades is temporary (not eternal). The unified "hell" concept exists only in the English translation, not in the source texts. | #3 (external framework: KJV translation as interpretive lens), overrides E021, E028, N022, N024 |
| I5 | The "under the sun" qualifier invalidates sheol descriptions in Ecclesiastes, rendering the didactic death-state passages unreliable | I-C | ECT-direction | E5/E021 (Ecc 9:10: no work/knowledge in sheol). The "under the sun" phrase appears in Ecc 9:6, not 9:10 (which simply says "in the grave whither thou goest"). More importantly, the same death-state observations are made in Psalms (6:5; 30:9; 88:10-12; 115:17), Job (3:17-18; 7:9-10; 10:21-22; 14:12-21; 17:13-16; 34:14-15), and Isaiah (38:18-19) -- authors who do not use the "under the sun" framework. | The claim applies one author's literary device to six or more other authors who do not use it. Even within Ecclesiastes, "under the sun" appears in 9:6, not in 9:5 or 9:10. The claim requires extending a qualifier from one book to other books that do not contain it. | #3 (external framework: applying one author's literary device to all death-state passages) |

### I-B Resolution: I1 -- Sheol/Hades Is a Place of Conscious Existence

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E28/E155 (Luke 16:23: rich man conscious in hades), E19/E171 (Isa 14:9-10: rephaim "speak" in sheol), E20/E183 (Ezek 32:21: mighty "speak" in sheol)
- AGAINST: E5/E021 (Ecc 9:10: no work/knowledge/wisdom), E6/E017 (Ps 6:5: no remembrance), E7/E018 (Ps 115:17: silence), E8/E044 (Ps 88:10-12: forgetfulness, darkness), E10/E145 (Job 10:21-22: darkness), E11/E146 (Job 17:13: bed in darkness), E12/E144 (Job 7:9-10: come up no more)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E155 (Luke 16:23) | Ambiguous | Parabolic genre. Fails Tree 3 Gates 1 and 3. The rich man is a character in a parable. |
| E171 (Isa 14:9-10) | Ambiguous | The text itself identifies this as a mashal (taunt-poem, v.4). Personification is the governing device. |
| E183 (Ezek 32:21) | Ambiguous | Prophetic lamentation (qinah). Verse 27 describes subjects lying with swords under their heads (sleep/rest). |
| E021 (Ecc 9:10) | Plain | Direct didactic statement: no work, device, knowledge, wisdom in sheol. |
| E017 (Ps 6:5) | Plain | Direct didactic statement: no remembrance in death, no thanksgiving in sheol. |
| E018 (Ps 115:17) | Plain | Direct didactic statement: the dead praise not the LORD; they go down into silence. |
| E044 (Ps 88:10-12) | Plain | Direct didactic statement: God's wonders unknown in the dark, the land of forgetfulness. |
| E145 (Job 10:21-22) | Plain | Direct speech: death is the land of darkness, without any order. |
| E146 (Job 17:13) | Plain | Direct speech: sheol is a house, bed in darkness, rest in dust. |
| E144 (Job 7:9-10) | Plain | Direct speech: he that goeth down to sheol shall come up no more. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 3 Ambiguous items (1 parabolic, 1 mashal, 1 prophetic lamentation).
AGAINST: 7 Plain items from four authors (Solomon, David, Heman, Job) across three books (Ecclesiastes, Psalms, Job).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The didactic passages (Ecc 9:10; Ps 6:5; 115:17; 88:10-12) directly address what sheol is like and use relevant vocabulary (no work, no knowledge, silence, forgetfulness). The FOR passages are: a parable (genre not didactic), a mashal/taunt-poem (genre is literary personification, identified by the text itself), and a prophetic lamentation (genre is dirge). Didactic > parabolic/poetic in the clarity hierarchy. The plain didactic descriptions govern the reading of the literary/parabolic depictions.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
7 Plain didactic items on the AGAINST side vs. 3 Ambiguous items (all from non-didactic genres) on the FOR side. The plain governs the ambiguous. Sheol/hades is characterized by unconsciousness in didactic passages; the depictions of consciousness come from parabolic and poetic genres. Master I032 *NEW*.

### I-B Resolution: I2 -- Gehenna Is a Place of Eternal Conscious Torment

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E34/E127 (Mark 9:43-48: unquenchable fire, undying worm)
- AGAINST: E30/E028 (Matt 10:28: God destroys in gehenna), E31/E189 (Matt 5:29-30: perish/apollumi), E33/E191 (Luke 12:5: kills then casts into gehenna), E35/E192 (Isa 66:24: carcases/corpses), E40/E197 (no gehenna passage uses torment vocabulary for humans)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E127 (Mark 9:43-48) | Contextually Clear | Jesus quotes Isa 66:24. The imagery (worm, fire) is drawn from an OT text that describes corpses. The phrase "unquenchable fire" appears in OT contexts of completed destruction (Jer 17:27; Isa 34:10). |
| E028 (Matt 10:28) | Plain | Jesus' direct teaching: God can "destroy" (apollumi) both soul and body in gehenna. The verb is destroy, not torment. |
| E189 (Matt 5:29-30) | Plain | Jesus' direct teaching (Sermon on the Mount): members "perish" (apollumi) vs. whole body cast into gehenna. |
| E191 (Luke 12:5) | Plain | Jesus' direct teaching: God kills, then casts into gehenna. Sequence: death, then gehenna. |
| E192 (Isa 66:24) | Plain | The prophetic source text specifies "carcases" (peger = dead bodies). The Hebrew is unambiguous. |
| E197 (no gehenna torment vocab) | Plain | Observable fact: no gehenna passage uses basanizo, basanismos, or kolasis for humans. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 1 Contextually Clear item (Mark 9:43-48, which quotes Isa 66:24).
AGAINST: 5 Plain items including Jesus' own direct teaching (Matt 10:28: apollumi; Luke 12:5: kills then casts) and the OT source text (Isa 66:24: corpses).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Mark 9:43-48 quotes Isaiah 66:24. This is a verified textual connection (direct OT quotation = #4a). The OT source describes "carcases" -- dead bodies, not living beings. The worm (tola'ath/skolex = maggot) is an agent of decomposition. The fire acts on the dead. This is the interpretive key for Mark 9:43-48.

Jesus' own vocabulary in gehenna passages is apollumi (destroy/perish), not basanizo (torment). In Matt 10:28, the same Jesus who quotes Isa 66:24 in Mark 9 says God "destroys" soul and body in gehenna. In Luke 12:5, the same Jesus says God "kills" and then "casts into gehenna." The consistent vocabulary of the speaker (Jesus) across multiple gehenna passages is destruction, not torment.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
5 Plain items (including Jesus' own apollumi/destroy vocabulary and the OT source text describing corpses) on the AGAINST side vs. 1 Contextually Clear item (which quotes the very OT text that describes corpses) on the FOR side. The OT source governs the reading of the NT quotation. Master I033 *NEW*.

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases Scripture, or states an observable linguistic/textual fact. Checked.
- Each uses plain lexical meaning without adding concepts. Checked.
- E-items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Checked.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- All items classified Conditionalist have full Tree 3 documentation.
- 10 items classified Conditionalist were documented in prior studies (etc-01, etc-04) with all four gates passed.
- 4 new Conditionalist items (E14/E180, E15/E181, E31/E189, E35/E192) have full Tree 3 documentation above with all four gates passed.
- No E-items classified as ECT.
- All neutral E-items are textual observations both sides accept.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- Each N-item follows unavoidably from cited E-items. Checked.
- Three N-tier tests applied to each. All pass (documented above).
- N3/N004 (sheol characterized by unconsciousness in didactic passages) classified Conditionalist because one side must qualify these statements.
- All other N-items are Neutral because both sides accept the textual observations.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1 (sheol conscious): E/N items on both sides -> text-derived -> I-B. Checked.
- I2 (gehenna eternal torment): E/N items on both sides -> text-derived -> I-B. Checked.
- I3 (Rev 20:10 extends to all): Imports concept from specific subjects to all humans -> external framework -> I-C. Checked.
- I4 (four words = one concept): Imports KJV translation as hermeneutical lens -> external -> I-D (overrides E/N statements about distinct semantic ranges). Checked.
- I5 ("under the sun" invalidates): Imports one author's qualifier to all authors -> external -> I-C. Checked.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1: Requires didactic statements about sheol's unconsciousness to be overridden by parabolic/poetic depictions -> conflicts -> I-B. Checked.
- I2: Requires apollumi (destroy) to mean "torment" and peger (corpse) to mean "living being" -> conflicts -> I-B. Checked.
- I3: Does not directly override E48/E125 (which says what it says about the three subjects) but extends it beyond stated subjects -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I4: Requires overriding E/N statements about distinct meanings -> conflicts -> I-D. Checked.
- I5: Does not directly override E5/E021 but attempts to limit its scope -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.

**Step E: Consistency checks.**
- I-B (I1, I2): Both have E/N items on BOTH sides. Confirmed.
- I-C (I3, I5): Neither overrides an E/N statement directly. Confirmed.
- I-D (I4): Overrides multiple E/N statements (distinct semantic ranges, distinct subjects, distinct temporal scopes). Confirmed.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- Mark 9:43-48 quoting Isaiah 66:24: direct OT quotation, verified textual connection (#4a). Checked.
- Acts 2:27,31 quoting Psalm 16:10: direct OT quotation, verified textual connection (#4a). Checked.
- "Under the sun" applied to non-Ecclesiastes passages: no verified textual connection (#4b, inference trigger). Checked.
- Rev 20:10 subjects extended to Rev 20:15 humans: no textual statement connecting the three subjects' fate to human fate (#4b, inference trigger). Checked.

Note: I-B items (I1/I032 and I2/I033) classified by the direction they argue (ECT-direction). Both were resolved Strong toward the Conditionalist reading via SIS: didactic descriptions of sheol (unconsciousness) govern parabolic/poetic depictions (I1); Jesus' destruction vocabulary (apollumi) and Isaiah 66:24's corpse-description govern the reading of gehenna imagery (I2).

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture Explicitly States or Necessarily Implies)

1. Sheol (H7585) and hades (G86) are semantically equivalent. The LXX translates sheol as hades in 58 of approximately 65 instances. Acts 2:27,31 directly demonstrates this equivalence by quoting Psalm 16:10 (sheol) using hades. Both words designate the realm/state of the dead.

2. Sheol/hades receives both righteous and wicked. Jacob (Gen 37:35), David (Ps 16:10), Christ (Acts 2:27,31), the wicked (Ps 9:17), and Korah (Num 16:33) all go to sheol/hades. It is the universal destination of the dead, not a punishment venue for the wicked alone.

3. Sheol is characterized by unconsciousness in didactic passages: no work, no device, no knowledge, no wisdom (Ecc 9:10); no remembrance, no thanksgiving (Ps 6:5); silence (Ps 115:17); darkness (Job 10:21-22; 17:13); forgetfulness (Ps 88:12); rest (Job 3:17-18). Six didactic passages from four authors describe these characteristics. No didactic passage describes sheol as a place of conscious activity.

4. Hades is temporary. Death and hades deliver up the dead for judgment and are then cast into the lake of fire (Rev 20:13-14). Hades is a holding state ended by resurrection.

5. Hades and the lake of fire are distinct. Hades is cast INTO the lake of fire (Rev 20:14). One entity cannot be the same as the entity it is cast into.

6. Gehenna (G1067) derives from ge-Hinnom, the Valley of the son of Hinnom -- a real geographic location southwest of Jerusalem (Josh 15:8; 18:16). Its OT associations are: child sacrifice to Molech (2 Ki 23:10; 2 Chr 28:3; 33:6; Jer 7:31; 32:35), prophetic cursing as "the valley of slaughter" (Jer 7:32; 19:6), and burial until no room remains (Jer 7:32).

7. In gehenna passages, Jesus uses destruction vocabulary (apollumi: destroy, perish), not torment vocabulary. Matt 10:28: God "destroys" both soul and body in gehenna. Matt 5:29-30: members "perish." Luke 12:5: God kills, then casts into gehenna. No gehenna passage applies basanizo, basanismos, or kolasis to human beings.

8. Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24 in Mark 9:43-48. The Isaiah source describes "carcases" (peger = dead bodies/corpses) consumed by worm and fire. The subjects of the worm and fire are dead, not living.

9. The alternative to gehenna in Jesus' teaching is consistently "enter into life" (Matt 18:9; Mark 9:43,45,47). The dichotomy is life vs. gehenna (destruction), not life vs. torment.

10. Tartaroo (G5020) is a verb (to cast into Tartarus) used once in the entire NT (2 Pet 2:4), applied exclusively to fallen angels, never to human beings. It describes temporary imprisonment ("reserved unto judgment"), not a final destination.

11. The KJV translates sheol (31x as "grave," 27x as "hell"), hades (10x as "hell," 1x as "grave"), gehenna (11x as "hell"), and tartaroo (1x as "hell") -- all as "hell." This creates the appearance of a single concept where the original languages have four distinct words with different semantic ranges.

12. Rev 20:10 applies "tormented day and night for ever and ever" to three named subjects: the devil, the beast, and the false prophet. When human beings enter the same lake of fire (Rev 20:15; 21:8), the identifying term is "the second death" -- death vocabulary, not torment vocabulary.

## What CANNOT Be Said (Not Explicitly Stated or Necessarily Implied by Scripture)

1. **It cannot be said that sheol/hades inherently means "place of torment."** The word's etymology (unseen place), LXX translation pattern (no torment vocabulary), and biblical usage (receives righteous and wicked alike; characterized by unconsciousness in didactic passages) do not support this meaning. The one passage depicting conscious torment in hades (Luke 16:23) is a parable.

2. **It cannot be said that gehenna inherently means "place of eternal conscious torment."** The word's etymology (Valley of Hinnom -- a geographic location), OT background (slaughter, corpse disposal), and NT usage (apollumi/destroy vocabulary; Isaiah 66:24 source describing corpses) point to destruction, not ongoing torment.

3. **It cannot be said that tartaroo tells us anything about human fate.** It is used once, for angels only.

4. **It cannot be said that the four "hell" words describe one unified concept.** They have distinct semantic ranges (general abode of all dead; eschatological destruction; angel imprisonment), distinct subjects (all humans; the wicked; angels), and distinct temporal scopes (temporary holding; final; pre-judgment).

5. **It cannot be said that Rev 20:10's torment language applies to human beings.** The three named subjects (devil, beast, false prophet) include one supernatural being and two symbolic entities. When human beings enter the lake of fire, the text identifies their fate as "the second death," not "torment."

6. **It cannot be said that the "worm that dieth not" and "fire that is not quenched" (Mark 9:48) describe the torment of living, conscious beings.** Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24, where the worm and fire act on "carcases" (peger = dead bodies). The worm (skolex = maggot) is an agent of decomposition. "Unquenchable fire" in OT usage means fire that cannot be extinguished before completing its work (cf. Jer 17:27; Isa 34:10; 2 Ki 22:17).

7. **It cannot be said that Isaiah 14:9-10 or Ezekiel 32:21 prove consciousness in sheol.** Isaiah 14:4 identifies the passage as a mashal (taunt-poem), and the same passage has trees rejoicing and sheol being "moved." Ezekiel 32 is prophetic lamentation, and v.27 describes subjects lying with swords under their heads (rest/sleep imagery). These are literary genres employing personification.

8. **It cannot be said that the "under the sun" qualifier invalidates the death-state descriptions in sheol.** The same observations about sheol's unconsciousness appear in Psalms (6:5; 88:10-12; 115:17), Job (3:17-18; 7:9-10; 10:21-22; 14:12-21; 17:13-16), and Isaiah (38:18-19) -- authors who do not use the "under the sun" framework.

## Analysis

### Sheol: The General Abode of All the Dead

Sheol (H7585) occurs approximately 67 times in the OT. The KJV translates it as "grave" 31 times, "hell" 27 times, and "pit" 3 times. The Revised Version and subsequent translations have increasingly retained "Sheol" as a transliteration, recognizing that neither "grave" (too physical) nor "hell" (too loaded with torment associations) adequately captures the word's semantic range.

The LXX translates sheol as hades in 58 of approximately 65 instances. The remaining translations use descending vocabulary, death, destruction, and soul. No torment-related word appears in the LXX translations of sheol. This demonstrates that pre-Christian Jewish translators understood sheol as the realm of the dead, not as a place of torment.

Examination of all ~67 occurrences reveals: (a) both righteous and wicked go to sheol, (b) didactic passages characterize it by unconsciousness, silence, darkness, no knowledge, no work, and no praise, (c) deliverance from sheol is equated with resurrection, (d) sheol is paired with abaddon (destruction) rather than with torment, (e) the two passages that depict apparent conscious activity in sheol (Isa 14:9-10; Ezek 32:21) are in identified literary genres (mashal and prophetic lamentation) using personification.

### Hades: The NT Equivalent of Sheol

Hades (G86) occurs 11 times in the NT. Acts 2:27,31 directly quotes Psalm 16:10 (sheol) using hades, confirming the words are interchangeable. Hades is paired with death throughout Revelation (1:18; 6:8; 20:13-14). It is temporary -- delivered up and destroyed (Rev 20:13-14). The etymology (a- + eido = unseen) carries no inherent meaning of torment. The one description of conscious torment in hades (Luke 16:23) is in a parable, classified Neutral in etc-04.

### Gehenna: Eschatological Destruction

Gehenna (G1067) occurs 12 times in the NT -- 11 from Jesus, 1 from James. It derives from the Valley of Hinnom, whose OT associations are child sacrifice, prophetic cursing, slaughter, burial, and corpse-disposal. Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24 in Mark 9:43-48; the Isaiah source describes worms and fire acting on "carcases" (peger = dead bodies). Jesus' consistent vocabulary in gehenna passages is apollumi (destroy, perish), not basanizo (torment). The alternative to gehenna is "enter into life" -- the life/destruction dichotomy. No gehenna passage applies torment vocabulary to human beings.

### Tartaroo: Angels Only

Tartaroo (G5020) appears once (2 Pet 2:4), as a verb, applied only to fallen angels. It describes temporary imprisonment ("reserved unto judgment"), paralleled in Jude 1:6. It has no bearing on the question of human final fate.

### The KJV Translation Problem

The KJV's translation of all four words as "hell" has created a unified concept in English that does not exist in the original languages. A KJV reader encounters "hell" 54 times and naturally infers a single destination of torment. The original texts contain three distinct concepts (general abode of all dead, eschatological destruction, angel imprisonment) with different characteristics, subjects, and temporal scopes.

### Cross-Study Integration

This study confirms and extends findings from prior studies:
- **etc-01** established that God can "destroy both soul and body in gehenna" (Matt 10:28, E028). This study examines all 12 gehenna passages and finds the destruction vocabulary (apollumi) is consistent throughout.
- **etc-02** established that the wages of sin is death (Rom 6:23, E087) and that the wicked are punished with "everlasting destruction" (2 Thess 1:9, E090). This study adds that gehenna -- the place of final judgment -- uses the same destruction vocabulary.
- **etc-03** established that the second death is the lake of fire (Rev 20:14, E123). This study adds that hades and the lake of fire are distinct (hades is cast into the lake of fire) and that when humans enter the lake of fire, the term is "the second death," not "torment."
- **etc-04** established that sheol/hades is the common destination of all the dead (N019) and that hades is temporary (N020). This study examines the full semantic range of all four "hell" words and confirms these findings exhaustively.

## Conclusion

This study examined 57 explicit statements, 9 necessary implications, and 5 inferences regarding the four words translated "hell" in the KJV.

14 explicit statements are classified Conditionalist: 10 describe sheol as unconscious/dark/silent (from prior studies) or describe consumption/destruction in sheol/gehenna (new items); 4 describe gehenna using destruction vocabulary or Isaiah 66:24 describing corpses. 0 explicit statements are classified ECT. 43 explicit statements are classified Neutral (textual observations accepted by both sides, including translation data, geographic origins, distribution patterns, genre identifications, and vocabulary observations).

1 necessary implication is classified Conditionalist (sheol characterized by unconsciousness in didactic passages). 8 are Neutral (sheol-hades equivalence, distinct concepts, hades temporary, hades distinct from lake of fire, tartaroo for angels only, gehenna OT background, KJV translation conflation).

2 inferences (I-B) present competing textual claims: (I1) that sheol/hades is a place of conscious existence, and (I2) that gehenna is a place of eternal conscious torment. Both resolved Strong toward the Conditionalist reading via SIS: didactic passages govern parabolic/poetic depictions, and Jesus' apollumi vocabulary plus the Isaiah 66:24 source text govern the reading of gehenna imagery. 2 inferences (I-C) import external frameworks. 1 inference (I-D) requires overriding multiple E/N statements to treat four distinct words as a unified concept of eternal torment.
