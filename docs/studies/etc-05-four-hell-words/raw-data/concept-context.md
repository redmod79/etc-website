## Mark 9:43
"And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched."

**Concepts Found:** No theological concepts identified by the tool.

**Note:** The concept_context tool did not identify mapped theological concepts in Mark 9:43. However, the verse's content links to the LIFE concept (entering into life vs. being cast into gehenna) and to the FIRE/DESTRUCTION motif. The OT source text for the "worm/fire" language is Isaiah 66:24, which describes corpses (peger), not living beings.

**Key Finding from Concept Context:** The concept_context tool categorizes hades (G86) under the DEATH concept, not as a separate theological category. This confirms that hades is understood within the biblical semantic field as part of the death/dying domain, not as a distinct "place of torment."
