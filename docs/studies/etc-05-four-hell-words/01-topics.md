## Question

English Bibles translate several different words as "hell." What are the original Hebrew and Greek words? Examine sheol (H7585), hades (G86), gehenna (G1067), and tartaroo (G5020). What is the semantic range of each? Are they interchangeable? Do any of them inherently mean a place of eternal conscious torment?

### HELL

From Nave's Topical Dictionary:

**Note on translation:** In the A.V. (KJV) this word occurs in O.T. Scriptures as the translation of the Hebrew word "sheol," which signifies the unseen state.

**R.V. Usage (partial list):** In the R.V. of O.T., "hell" appears only in ISA 5:14; 14:9,15; 28:15,18; 57:9; EZK 31:16,17; 32:21,27; AMO 9:2; JON 2:2; HAB 2:5. In the R.V., "sheol" is translated "lowest pit" in DEU 32:22; PSA 86:13, and "pit" in PSA 55:15. In the R.V. the word "Sheol" itself occurs in: 2SA 22:6; JOB 11:8; 26:6; PSA 9:17; 16:10; 18:5; 116:3; 139:8; PRO 5:5; 7:27; 9:18; 15:11,24; 23:14; 27:20.

**Greek "hades" retained in R.V. at:** MAT 11:23; 16:18; LUK 10:15; 16:23; ACT 2:27,31; REV 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14.

**THE FUTURE HOME OF THE WICKED:** PSA 9:17; PRO 5:5; 9:13,15-18; 15:24; 23:13,14; ISA 30:33; 33:14; MAT 3:12; 5:29,30; 7:13,14; 8:11,12; 10:28; 13:30,38-42,49,50; 16:18; 18:8,9,34,35; 22:13; 25:28-30,41,46; MRK 9:43-48; LUK 3:17; 16:23-26,28; ACT 1:25; 2TH 1:9; 2PE 2:4; Jude 1:6-23; REV 2:11; 9:1,2; 11:7; 14:10,11; 19:20; 20:10,15; 21:8.

### HADES

From Nave's Topical Dictionary:

**1. The unseen world**, translated "hell" in A.V., but in the R.V. the word "Hades" is retained:
MAT 10:28; 11:23; 16:18; LUK 10:15; 16:23; ACT 2:27,31; REV 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14.

**2. The realm (state) of the dead:**
2SA 22:6; JOB 26:5; PSA 6:5; 17:15; 30:9; 49:15; 86:13; 88:10-12; 115:17; 116:3; PRO 15:24; 21:16; 27:20; ECC 9:4-6; ISA 5:14; JON 2:2; LUK 23:42,43; JHN 8:22; 2CO 12:4.

Cross-references: See HELL; IMMORTALITY; PARADISE; RIGHTEOUS, FUTURE STATE OF; SPIRIT; WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF.

**Nave's Note on Hades vs. Sheol:** Nave's organizes both under HELL, with HADES pointing back to HELL. The entry for HADES 2 explicitly uses OT passages (from the realm of sheol) to illustrate what hades is — confirming the equivalence. The LXX translated sheol as hades 58 times (PMI score 33.87 — by far the strongest lexical correspondence).

### TOPHET / VALLEY OF HINNOM

From Nave's Topical Dictionary:

- Also called TOPHETH.
- A place in the valley of the sons of Hinnom: 2KI 23:10.
- Jewish children passed through the fire to the god Molech: 2KI 23:10; JER 7:31,32; 19:6,11-14; 32:35.
- See also 2CH 28:3; 33:6.
- Destroyed by Josiah: 2KI 23:10.
- Horror of: ISA 30:33.

**Note on etymology:** The Greek word γέεννα (gehenna, G1067) derives directly from the Hebrew גֵּי הִנֹּם (gê Hinnôm, H1516+H2011) — "Valley of Hinnom." The Strong's lexicon for G1067 confirms: "of Hebrew origin (H1516 and H2011); valley of (the son of) Hinnom." The valley became a burning garbage dump after Josiah defiled it (2 Ki 23:10), and Jesus uses it as the symbol for final judgment.

---

### GEHENNA

Nave's entry: "See HELL" — no independent entry. GEHENNA redirects entirely to HELL.

**What the lexicon adds (G1067):**
- Feminine noun, from Hebrew gê Hinnôm
- 12 NT occurrences per BLB count; 11 in KJV translation distribution
- Used exclusively by Jesus (11 of 12 occurrences) plus James 3:6
- All NT uses are figurative/eschatological — none are references to the literal valley

### PUNISHMENT (Eternal)

From Nave's Topical Dictionary — PUNISHMENT: ETERNAL sub-entry:

ISA 34:8-10; DAN 12:2; MAT 3:12; 10:28; 18:8; 25:41,46; MRK 3:29; LUK 3:17; JHN 5:29; HEB 6:2; 10:28-31; REV 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10.

Nave's cross-reference: See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF.

**Nave's ETERNAL PUNISHMENT, EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT, FUTURE PUNISHMENT** all redirect to "PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL" — indicating Nave's treats all three as the same topic.

**From WICKED (PEOPLE) — PUNISHMENT OF (selected NT passages):**
MAT 3:7,10,12; 5:19-30; 10:28; 13:30,38-42,49,50; 18:7-9,34,35; 25:30,32,33,41,46; MRK 9:43; LUK 3:7,17; 12:4,5,46,47; 16:22-28; JHN 3:15,16,18,36; 5:14,29; ROM 1:18; 2:5,8; 6:16,21; 2TH 1:5-9; HEB 2:2,3; 6:8; 10:27-31; 2PE 2:3-9; 1JN 3:14,15; Jude 1:5-7,11-15; REV 14:9-11; 19:15,17-21; 20:10,15; 21:8,27; 22:19.

From Nave's Topical Dictionary:

**Figurative uses relevant to study:**
- Judgments: DEU 4:24; 32:22; ISA 33:14; JER 23:29; AMO 1:4,7,10,12,14; 2:2; MAL 3:2; LUK 12:49; REV 20:9.
- Of the destruction of the wicked: MAT 13:42,50; 25:41; MRK 9:44; REV 9:2; 21:8.
- EVERLASTING FIRE: ISA 33:14; MAT 18:8; 25:41; MRK 9:44.

---

### SHEOL

Nave's entry: "See HELL (Hades)" — redirects to the HELL entry.

---

### SECOND DEATH

Nave's entry: "General scriptures concerning: REV 20:14. See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF."

This confirms Nave's identifies the second death with REV 20:14 (the lake of fire = second death equation).

- **DEATH**: Grouped with hades throughout Revelation (Rev 1:18; 6:8; 20:13-14).
