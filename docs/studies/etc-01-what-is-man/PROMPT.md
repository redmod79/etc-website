# Bible Study: What Is Man? Biblical Anthropology and Human Constitution

## Question

What does Scripture teach about human constitution? What is a human being according to the Bible — body, soul, spirit? Are these separate substances or aspects of one unity? Is the soul inherently immortal or mortal? Do animals have souls/spirits? How does the human constitution relate to what happens at death?

### Focus Areas

The following focus areas are derived directly from tool discoveries — the topics, verse references, and Strong's entries found by the search tools.

#### 1. The Creation Formula (Gen 2:7) — What Happened?
The DUST topic and BREATH topic both anchor to GEN 2:7. The formula "dust + breath of life = living soul (nephesh chayyah)" is the foundation of all biblical anthropology. The research agent must retrieve and parse this verse carefully, plus the Nave's LIFE entry which notes: "Breath of [life] GEN 2:7" and "Called SPIRIT OF GOD JOB 27:3." The question is whether man *became* a nephesh or *received* a nephesh.

#### 2. Nephesh and Ruach Applied to Animals (Not Just Humans)
Nave's CREATION entry points to ANIMALS. The BREATH entry cites Gen 7:22 (all creatures had breath of life). H5315 (nephesh) appears in GEN 1:20,21,24; 2:19 (animals called nephesh chayyah). H7307 (ruach) appears in GEN 6:17; 7:15. Research must retrieve all instances of nephesh chayyah applied to animals vs. humans and document whether the same Hebrew construction is used.

#### 3. Image of God (Tselem/Eikon) as the Distinguishing Factor
Nave's MAN topic includes "CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD" (GEN 1:26,27; 9:6; ECC 7:29; 1CO 11:7; 15:48,49; JAS 3:9). H6754 (tselem) appears 17 times in OT. H1823 (demuth) appears 25 times. G1504 (eikon) appears in COL 3:10; 2CO 3:18; 4:4; COL 1:15. Research must map all tselem occurrences and determine if image is ever applied to animals.

#### 4. Inherent Immortality vs. Conditional Immortality
G110 (athanasia) appears only at 1CO 15:53 and 1TI 6:16. G861 (aphtharsia) appears at ROM 2:7 (seeking it); 2TI 1:10 (brought to light). G2349 (thnetos, "mortal") appears at 1CO 15:53 (must put on immortality). Nave's IMMORTALITY entry lists extensive scriptures. Research must examine:
- 1TI 6:16: who "only" (monos) has immortality
- 1CO 15:53: mortals must "put on" immortality
- ROM 2:7: believers "seek for" immortality
- GEN 3:22-24: tree of life needed to live forever

#### 5. The Soul's Mortality — Can Nephesh/Psyche Die?
Nave's DEATH SECOND entry lists EZK 18:4,10,13,21,23,24 (soul that sins dies). MAT 10:28 (God destroys both soul and body in gehenna). REV 16:3 (every living soul/psyche died in the sea). LEV 21:11; NUM 6:6 (nephesh = dead body/corpse). Research must retrieve these and examine whether the soul is portrayed as dying, being destroyed, or referring to a corpse.

#### 6. State of the Dead — Consciousness or Unconsciousness?
Nave's DEATH entry includes extensive "unclassified scriptures" covering: PSA 6:5; PSA 115:17; PSA 146:4; ECC 9:3,5,6,10; ECC 12:7; ISA 38:18; JOB 14:21. Death is called "sleep" (DEU 31:16; JOB 14:12; DAN 12:2; JHN 11:11; 1TH 4:14,15; 1CO 15:51). Research must retrieve all "state of the dead" passages.

#### 7. Spirit Returning to God at Death (Ecc 12:7)
Nave's LIFE FROM GOD subtopic and BREATH entry both connect to ECC 12:7 ("dust returns to earth… spirit returns to God who gave it"). H7307 (ruach) lexicon entry shows it appears in Ecc 12:7. The research question: does this describe a conscious entity going to God, or the breath/life-force returning to its source?

#### 8. Trichotomy vs. Dichotomy vs. Holistic Unity
Nave's SPIRIT entry notes it is "called the inner man" (ROM 7:22; EPH 3:16). Nave's BODY lists the body as a temple (1CO 6:19) and house (2CO 5:1). The key passages are:
- 1TH 5:23: "spirit and soul and body" (G4151, G5590, G4983)
- HEB 4:12: "dividing asunder of soul and spirit"
- LUK 1:46-47: soul and spirit as synonymous parallels
- MRK 12:30: four terms (heart, soul, mind, strength)
- G5591 (psychikos) appears at 1CO 15:44,45 (natural body vs. spiritual body)

#### 9. Paul's Adam Contrast (1 Cor 15)
1CO 15:45 (first Adam: living soul/psychen zosan; last Adam: quickening spirit/pneuma zoopoioun). G5517 (choikos, "earthy/dusty") appears at 1CO 15:47,48,49. G4152 (pneumatikos) at 1CO 15:44,46. G5591 (psychikos) at 1CO 15:44,45,46. This is the NT commentary on GEN 2:7 and must be examined carefully.

#### 10. Intermediate State — What Happens Between Death and Resurrection?
Nave's DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS cites 2CO 5:1,4,8; PHP 1:20,21,23,24; LUK 23:43; LUK 16:22. Nave's RESURRECTION lists REV 20:4-6,13. Research must gather:
- 2CO 5:1-9 (body as tent, desire to be clothed)
- PHP 1:20-24 (depart and be with Christ)
- LUK 16:22-28 (Lazarus and rich man)
- REV 6:9-11 (souls under the altar)
- HEB 12:23 (spirits of just men made perfect)
