# Bible Study: What Is Man? -- Biblical Anthropology and Human Constitution (etc-01)

## Question
What does Scripture explicitly say about the nature and composition of human beings (biblical anthropology)? Focus on nephesh (soul), ruach (spirit), neshamah (breath), the creation of man, whether humans ARE souls or HAVE souls, and what happens at death.

## Methodology
This study follows the **etc series methodology** defined in `D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-series-methodology.md`. The analysis agent MUST:
- Read and follow the etc-series-methodology.md in its entirety
- Apply the **Classification Decision Trees** (Trees 1-5) mechanically to every evidence item
- Use the **Evidence Hierarchy**: E > N > I-A > I-B > I-C > I-D
- Follow the **Investigative Methodology** (investigator, not advocate)
- Produce a full **Evidence Classification** section in CONCLUSION.md
- Read and update `etc-master-evidence.md` before writing the tally
- Include the **Verification Phase** (Steps A-F)
- Include **What CAN Be Said** and **What CANNOT Be Said** sections

**Key Findings from Related Studies (CONCLUSION.md summaries):**

1. **soul-nephesh-psyche**: Nephesh/psyche is NOT an immortal entity. Man BECAME a living soul (Gen 2:7), not received one. Same term applies to animals. Souls can die (Ezek 18:4,20). Nephesh used for dead bodies (Lev 21:11; Num 6:6). God can destroy the soul (Matt 10:28). Immortality must be "sought" (Rom 2:7) and "put on" at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54). God "only hath immortality" (1 Tim 6:16). The word is translated 200+ ways showing it is not a technical term for "immortal soul."

2. **nature-of-man**: Man is a psychosomatic unity -- BECAME a living soul, not assembled from parts. Spirit/ruach functions as animating life principle. Genesis 2:7 uses neshamah (not ruach). Animals share nephesh and ruach. Scripture uses soul/spirit with flexibility -- sometimes synonymous, sometimes distinct. Neither dichotomy nor trichotomy is explicitly prescribed. Human uniqueness may lie in imago Dei, not in having soul/spirit.

3. **etc4-04-state-of-the-dead**: 68 explicit statements, 11 necessary implications, 11 inferences. Death reverses creation (dust + breath = living soul reversed). At death, ruach departs and thoughts perish "in that very day" (Ps 146:4). Dead "know not any thing" (Ecc 9:5). Death is "sleep" -- used by 7+ biblical authors. Without resurrection, dead "are perished" (1 Cor 15:18). All I-B inferences (consciousness claims) resolved Strong toward unconsciousness. I-D classification for inherent soul immortality.

### Focus Areas

Derived from tool discoveries, these are the key areas to investigate:

1. **The Creation Formula (Gen 2:7)**: Dust + neshamah/breath of life = living nephesh. Does this establish that man IS a soul or HAS a soul? What does "became" (hayah) mean?

2. **Nephesh (H5315) Usage Range**: How is nephesh used across Scripture? Applied to animals? To dead bodies? What does this semantic range tell us about the nature of the soul?

3. **Ruach (H7307) vs. Neshamah (H5397)**: Are these synonymous or distinct? Gen 2:7 uses neshamah; Ecc 12:7 uses ruach. What is the relationship?

4. **Animals and Nephesh/Ruach**: Gen 1:20-24 applies nephesh chayyah to animals. Ecc 3:19 says humans and animals have "one breath" (ruach echad). What does shared terminology imply?

5. **What Happens at Death -- Reversal of Creation**: Gen 3:19; Ps 104:29; Ecc 12:7; Job 34:14-15. Does death reverse the creation formula?

6. **Consciousness at Death**: Ps 146:4 (thoughts perish); Ecc 9:5,6,10 (dead know nothing); Ps 6:5; 115:17 (no remembrance/praise). What do these explicitly state?

7. **Immortality -- Inherent or Conditional?**: 1 Tim 6:16 (God ONLY has immortality); Rom 2:7 (seek immortality); 1 Cor 15:53-54 (put on immortality). Is immortality part of human nature or a gift?

8. **Image of God (Imago Dei)**: Gen 1:26,27; 9:6; 1 Co 11:7; Jas 3:9. Does this distinguish humans from animals in a way that nephesh/ruach do not?

9. **1 Thess 5:23 and Heb 4:12**: Do these teach tripartite constitution (body, soul, spirit) or something else?

10. **Matt 10:28**: "Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." What does this teach about the soul's nature?

11. **Death as Sleep**: Seven+ authors use this metaphor (Deut 31:16; Job 7:21; Dan 12:2; John 11:11; Acts 7:60; 1 Cor 15:51; 1 Thess 4:13-15). What does the consistency imply?

12. **Resurrection as the Hope**: Dan 12:2; 1 Cor 15:12-55; 1 Thess 4:14-17. Is resurrection the mechanism for future life, not inherent survival of death?

### Analysis Agent Instructions (for Phase 4)

The analysis agent MUST:
1. Read `D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-series-methodology.md` in full
2. Apply the **Classification Decision Trees** (Trees 1-5) to every evidence item
3. Follow the **Evidence Hierarchy**: E > N > I-A > I-B (resolved by SIS) > I-C > I-D
4. Classify every piece of evidence using the **E/N/I taxonomy** with 4-type inference subclassification
5. Run the full **Verification Phase** (Steps A-F)
6. Read and update `etc-master-evidence.md` before writing the tally
7. Include **What CAN Be Said** and **What CANNOT Be Said** sections
8. Present findings as data -- investigator, not advocate
9. Apply the **Conclusion Tone Rule** -- no hedging, no editorializing
10. Use the **I-B Resolution Protocol** (5-step process) for any competing-evidence inferences
11. Note: For Tree 3 positional classification, adapt vocabulary scan to this study's subject matter (human mortality/composition rather than just final fate of the wicked)
