## Overview of Topics Found

The following topics were retrieved from Nave's Topical Bible. Topics are organized by relevance to the study question: "What is a human being — body, soul, spirit? Is the soul inherently immortal? Do animals have souls?"

**Key finding:** Nave's SOUL entry has NO standalone content. It consists entirely of cross-references: See SPIRIT, See IMMORTALITY, See MAN A SPIRIT. This itself is significant — Nave's editors did not treat "soul" as an independent theological category but directed readers to SPIRIT, IMMORTALITY, and MAN.

## 1. SOUL

**Full Nave's entry:**
- See SPIRIT
- See IMMORTALITY
- See MAN, A SPIRIT
- See RIGHTEOUS, FUTURE STATE OF
- See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Research note:** SOUL has no independent verse list. It is entirely defined by cross-reference to SPIRIT and IMMORTALITY. This suggests Nave (following standard Protestant topical organization) does not distinguish soul from spirit as sharply separate entities. See MAN, A SPIRIT for the full verse listing.

## 2. SPIRIT (of Man)

**Full Nave's entry:**
- Called "the inner man": ROM 7:22; EPH 3:16
- See ANGELS; See DEMONS; See HOLY SPIRIT; See MAN, A SPIRIT; See SATAN

**From MAN, A SPIRIT subtopic (full verse listing):**
JOB 4:19; JOB 32:8; PSA 31:5; PRO 20:27; ECC 1:8; ECC 3:21; ECC 12:7; ISA 26:9; ZEC 12:1; MAT 4:4; MAT 10:28; MAT 26:41; MRK 14:38; LUK 22:40; LUK 23:46; LUK 24:39; JHN 3:3-8; JHN 4:24; ACT 7:59; ROM 1:9; ROM 2:29; ROM 7:14-25; 1CO 2:11; 1CO 6:20; 1CO 7:34; 1CO 14:14; 2CO 4:6,7,16; 2CO 5:1-9; EPH 3:16; EPH 4:4; 1TH 5:23; HEB 4:12; JAS 2:26

**Also from GHOST entry:** "Soul ACT 5:5,10; 12:23 — See SPIRIT — See MAN, CREATED A SPIRIT"
(Indicates that "giving up the ghost" language refers to the spirit/soul = the vital principle)

## 3. BODY

**Full Nave's entry:**
- Called HOUSE: 2CO 5:1
- Called HOUSE OF CLAY: JOB 4:19
- Called THE TEMPLE OF GOD: 1CO 3:16; 6:3,15,19
- Corruptible: JOB 17:14; 1CO 15:53,54
- Resurrection of: 1CO 15:19-54
- See RESURRECTION

**Theological note:** Body is consistently described as a temporary dwelling — a house, a tent (cf. 2CO 5:1-4), a temple. Its corruptibility is stated plainly (JOB 17:14; 1CO 15:53-54). Resurrection transforms the body from corruptible to incorruptible.

## 5. IMMORTALITY

**Full Nave's entry (general scriptures):**
GEN 5:24; 2SA 12:23; 2KI 2:11; NEH 9:5; JOB 4:17-21; 14:13; PSA 16:10,11; 21:4; 22:26; 23:6; 31:5; 36:9; 37:18,27; 49:7-9,14,15; 73:26; 86:12; 102:4,25-28; 121:8; 133:3; 145:1,2; PRO 14:32; ECC 3:21; 12:7; ISA 14:9; 25:8; 26:19; 38:18,19; EZK 32:31; DAN 12:2,3; MAT 10:28; 16:26; 19:16,17; 25:46; MRK 10:30; 12:26,27; LUK 9:25; 10:25-28; 20:36-38; JHN 3:14-16,36; 5:39,40; 6:39,40,44,47,50,51,53,54,58; 10:28; 11:25,26; 14:19; 17:2,3; ACT 20:32; 23:8,9; 26:7,8,18; ROM 2:7; 6:22,23; 1CO 15:12-55; GAL 6:8; COL 1:5,6; 1TH 4:13-18; 5:10; 2TH 1:7-9; 2:16; 1TI 4:8; 6:12,19; 2TI 1:9,10; TIT 1:2; 3:7; HEB 9:15; 10:34; 11:5,10,13-16; 1PE 1:3-5; 1JN 2:17,25; 5:13; Jude 1:21; REV 1:7; 3:4; 22:5

**Cross-references:** See RESURRECTION; See RIGHTEOUS, PROMISES TO; See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Research note:** Nave's IMMORTALITY entry is the longest relevant entry. Notably, the entry lists scriptures about immortality as something God gives or bestows (eternal life passages) alongside passages about the resurrection — suggesting Nave treats immortality as conditional/given, not inherent. ROM 2:7 (seeking immortality) and 1CO 15:12-55 (resurrection context) are central. 1TI 6:16 is NOT listed in this entry (it appears only implicitly through 1TI 6:12,19).
