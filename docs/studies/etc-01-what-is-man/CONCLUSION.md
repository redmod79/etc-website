# What Is Man? -- Biblical Anthropology and Human Constitution

## Question
What does Scripture explicitly say about the nature and composition of human beings (biblical anthropology)? Focus on nephesh (soul), ruach (spirit), neshamah (breath), the creation of man, whether humans ARE souls or HAVE souls, and what happens at death.

## Summary Answer
Scripture describes the creation of man as a formation from dust into which God breathed the breath of life, resulting in man becoming a living soul (Gen 2:7). The same term (nephesh chayyah) is applied to animals. At death, this process reverses: breath/spirit returns to God, the body returns to dust, and thoughts perish (Ecc 12:7; Ps 146:4). Immortality is described as belonging to God alone (1 Tim 6:16), something humans must seek (Rom 2:7) and put on at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54), not as an inherent human property.

## Key Verses
- **Genesis 2:7** -- "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
- **Genesis 1:20-21,24** -- Animals are called nephesh chayyah ("living creatures/living souls") -- same term as Gen 2:7.
- **Ecclesiastes 12:7** -- "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."
- **Psalm 146:4** -- "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish."
- **Ecclesiastes 9:5** -- "The dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward."
- **Ezekiel 18:4** -- "The soul that sinneth, it shall die."
- **1 Timothy 6:16** -- "Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto."
- **1 Corinthians 15:53** -- "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."
- **Matthew 10:28** -- "Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
- **James 2:26** -- "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The term "living soul" (nephesh chayyah) does not distinguish humans from animals | E3, E4 | Neutral | Both humans and animals receive the same designation (nephesh chayyah). The shared term cannot serve as a distinguishing marker. Any reader of any position must acknowledge this textual fact. | N001 |
| N2 | Man does not inherently possess immortality | E24, E25, E26 | Neutral | E24 states God ONLY has it; E25 states it must be sought; E26 states it must be put on. All three facts together leave no room for humans already possessing immortality. (N-tier test: all three pass -- universal agreement, no interpretation required, zero added concepts.) | N002 |
| N3 | The ruach/spirit that returns to God at death is not stated to carry consciousness | E9, E11 | Neutral | E9 says the ruach returns to God. E11 says thoughts perish in that very day. The text nowhere states the returning ruach is conscious. Any reader must acknowledge this is what the text does and does not say. | N003 |
| N4 | Death involves cessation of cognitive activity | E11, E17, E19, E21, E42, E43, E44 | Cond. | Seven explicit statements from five different authors state that the dead lack thoughts, knowledge, remembrance, work, and wisdom. The cumulative force of these statements leaves no alternative reading of what they say. | N004 |
| N5 | The nephesh (soul) is mortal -- it can die and be destroyed | E16, E28 | Cond. | E16: "The soul that sins shall die." E28: God can "destroy both soul and body." Both state the soul is subject to death/destruction. Any reader must acknowledge these texts say the soul can die and be destroyed. | N005 |
| N6 | Death reverses the creation formula of Gen 2:7 | E1, E2, E3, E5, E9, E10, E12 | Neutral | Creation: dust + breath = living soul. Death: dust returns to earth (E5, E9), breath/spirit returns to God (E9, E10, E12). The reversal pattern is observable without adding any framework. | *NEW: N006* |
| N7 | Breath/spirit (ruach, neshamah) is given by God, not inherent to humans | E2, E9, E35, E36, E37 | Neutral | E2: God breathed it in. E9: it returns to God "who gave it." E35: God "giveth" breath and spirit. E36: God gives life and breath. E37: God forms the spirit within man. Every occurrence identifies God as the source. | *NEW: N007* |

**N-tier verification (3-question test applied to each):**

- **N1:** (1) Universal agreement: an ECT scholar acknowledges nephesh chayyah applies to both animals and humans -- YES. (2) No interpretation needed: YES. (3) Zero added concepts: YES. PASSES.
- **N2:** (1) An ECT scholar acknowledges 1 Tim 6:16 says "only" and 1 Cor 15:53 says "must put on" -- YES, but would argue this means humans don't have athanasia-type immortality while still having soul-immortality. This introduces interpretation. HOWEVER: the N-item says "man does not inherently possess immortality" -- this is what the three texts state using the word athanasia/aphtharsia. No concept is added. The qualification "but the soul has a different kind of immortality" adds a concept not in the text. (2) Only possible meaning of "only" and "must put on"? YES -- "only" means exclusively, "must put on" means does not currently have. (3) Zero added: YES. PASSES.
- **N3:** (1) An ECT scholar would acknowledge the text does not explicitly state the ruach is conscious after departure -- YES (they infer it from other passages). (2) No interpretation: YES. (3) Zero added: YES. PASSES.
- **N4:** (1) An ECT scholar would need to qualify these texts (e.g., "under the sun" limitation) to deny them -- the texts themselves state cessation. However, the positional classification is the issue: an ECT scholar would say these texts are limited in scope. The FACT of what the texts say is not in dispute; the scope is. The N-item says "death involves cessation of cognitive activity" as stated by these passages. PASSES universal agreement on what the texts say. (2) No interpretation: YES. (3) Zero added: YES. PASSES.
- **N5:** (1) An ECT scholar acknowledges Ezek 18:4 says the soul "dies" but interprets "die" differently (spiritual death, not cessation). The plain lexical value of "die" (mut) is death. Choosing "spiritual death" over "death" requires interpretation -- but at the N level we state what the text says, and the text says the nephesh dies and can be destroyed. PASSES. (2) "Die" means "die" -- one meaning. PASSES. (3) Zero added. PASSES.
- **N6:** (1) Both sides acknowledge the reversal pattern textually. PASSES. (2) One meaning. PASSES. (3) Zero added. PASSES.
- **N7:** (1) Both sides acknowledge God gives breath/spirit. PASSES. (2) One meaning. PASSES. (3) Zero added. PASSES.

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | Humans possess an immortal soul that survives death consciously | I-D | ECT | E24 (1 Tim 6:16): God ONLY has immortality. E26 (1 Cor 15:53-54): mortals MUST put on immortality. E16 (Ezek 18:4): the soul that sins dies. E28 (Matt 10:28): God can destroy soul and body. E11 (Ps 146:4): thoughts perish at death. E19 (Ecc 9:5): dead know nothing. | Requires overriding E24 (redefining "only" to exclude a type of immortality), E16 (redefining "die" to mean something other than death), E28 (redefining "destroy"), and E11/E19 (qualifying cessation statements). The concept "immortal soul" does not appear in any E or N statement. | #1 (adds concept: "immortal soul"), #2 (redefines "die," "only," "destroy"), #3 (applies Platonic philosophical framework) |
| I2 | The "under the sun" qualifier in Ecclesiastes limits its statements about death to earthly perspective only | I-C | ECT-direction | E19 (Ecc 9:5): "the dead know not any thing." E20 (Ecc 9:6): "neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun." | The phrase "under the sun" appears in Ecc 9:6, not 9:5. Applying it as a scope-limiter to ALL death statements in Ecclesiastes requires importing a hermeneutical framework. No verse says "these statements apply only to earthly observation." Does not directly contradict E-items (compatible), but introduces an interpretive lens not stated in the text. | #3 (external framework) |
| I3 | The spirit (ruach) that returns to God at death is a conscious personality | I-C | ECT-direction | E9 (Ecc 12:7): "the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." E11 (Ps 146:4): "his thoughts perish." N3: the text does not state the returning ruach is conscious. | The text says the ruach returns to God. The text does not say it carries consciousness, identity, or personality. Reading it as a conscious entity requires adding information the text does not contain. Does not directly contradict E9 (compatible), but adds a concept not present. | #1 (adds concept: conscious personality of ruach) |
| I4 | Man is a holistic unity (body + breath = living soul with no separable immortal component) | I-A | Cond. | E1-E3 (Gen 2:7): dust + breath = living soul. E9 (Ecc 12:7): reversal at death. E13 (Jas 2:26): body without spirit = dead. N6: death reverses creation. N2: man does not inherently possess immortality. | Systematizes E1-E3, E9, E13, N2, N6 into a unified anthropological position. All components are drawn from E/N statements. It is an inference only because it draws a comprehensive conclusion from multiple texts. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I5 | Man has a tripartite nature (body, soul, spirit as three distinct components) | I-C | Neutral | E29 (1 Thess 5:23): Paul mentions spirit, soul, body. E48: soul and spirit used in parallel (Isa 26:9; Luke 1:46-47). Heb 4:12 mentions dividing soul and spirit. | 1 Thess 5:23 lists three terms but does not teach they are three distinct components. Mark 12:30 lists four (heart, soul, mind, strength) without teaching four parts. The systematization into tripartism requires a philosophical framework not stated in the text. | #3 (external framework), #5 (systematizing) |
| I6 | Man has a bipartite nature (material body + immaterial soul/spirit) | I-C | Neutral | E29 (1 Thess 5:23): lists three terms. E48: soul and spirit in parallel. E13 (Jas 2:26): body without spirit = dead. E52 (Luke 23:46): Jesus commends his spirit. E53 (Acts 7:59-60): Stephen commends his spirit, then "fell asleep." | The texts show body and spirit as components, but do not define the spirit as a conscious, immortal entity separable at death. Stephen commends his spirit AND falls "asleep." Systematic bipartism requires a framework the text does not prescribe. | #3 (external framework), #5 (systematizing) |
| I7 | 2 Cor 5:8 and Phil 1:23 teach a conscious intermediate state between death and resurrection | I-B | ECT-direction | E49 (2 Cor 5:4,8): Paul prefers to be absent from body, present with Lord; wants to be clothed upon, not unclothed. E50 (Phil 1:23): Paul desires to depart and be with Christ. E40 (1 Thess 4:16-17): Dead in Christ rise first; being with the Lord follows resurrection. E39: Death is called sleep across multiple authors. | E49 and E50 express Paul's preference/desire. E40 and E39 describe death as sleep with future resurrection. A conscious intermediate state must be inferred -- the texts do not explicitly describe one. E49 specifically says Paul does NOT desire to be unclothed (to die). The claim requires combining E49/E50 with a reading that ignores E40 and E39. | #2 (choosing between possible readings), #4b (cross-referencing without verified textual connection between 2 Cor 5 and conscious intermediate state) |
| I8 | Luke 23:43 teaches Jesus and the thief entered paradise on the day of crucifixion | I-B | ECT-direction | E51 (Luke 23:43): Jesus says "Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise" (no Greek punctuation). E54 (John 20:17): On Sunday morning Jesus says he has NOT YET ascended to the Father. | The Greek has no commas. Placing "today" with "be with me in paradise" creates a conflict with E54 (Jesus had not ascended by Sunday). Placing "today" with "I say unto thee" resolves the conflict but requires choosing a reading. Both parsings are grammatically valid. | #2 (choosing between possible readings) |

#### I-B Resolution: I7 -- Conscious Intermediate State from 2 Cor 5 / Phil 1

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (conscious intermediate state): E49 (2 Cor 5:8 -- absent from body, present with Lord), E50 (Phil 1:23 -- depart and be with Christ)
- AGAINST: E40 (1 Thess 4:16-17 -- dead rise at Christ's coming, then caught up together), E39 (death = sleep, 7+ authors), E11 (thoughts perish at death), E19 (dead know nothing), E41 (man rises not till the heavens be no more)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E49 | Contextually Clear | Paul expresses a preference. The passage does NOT describe the intermediate state. Paul says he does NOT want to be unclothed (5:4). The full pericope focuses on the resurrection body (5:1-5), not disembodied existence. |
| E50 | Contextually Clear | A single verse expressing desire. Does not describe the mechanism or timing. |
| E40 | Plain | Didactic instruction: "the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we...shall be caught up...to meet the Lord." Being with the Lord is explicitly tied to resurrection. |
| E39 | Plain | Multiple authors across testaments call death "sleep." Jesus himself uses the term (John 11:11). |
| E11 | Plain | "In that very day his thoughts perish." Direct statement. |
| E19 | Plain | "The dead know not any thing." Direct statement. |
| E41 | Plain | "Man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more." Direct statement. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR the conscious intermediate state: 2 Contextually Clear items (E49, E50), both expressing Paul's preference without describing the intermediate state.
AGAINST: 5 Plain items (E40, E39, E11, E19, E41), all making direct statements about the state of the dead, from multiple authors.

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The plain didactic statements (E40: dead rise at Christ's coming; E11: thoughts perish; E19: dead know nothing) govern the reading of the contextually clear expressions (E49, E50). Paul's expressions of preference are read in light of his own explicit teaching (1 Thess 4:16-17) that being with the Lord requires resurrection. The subjective experience of death-as-sleep explains both texts: from the sleeper's perspective, departure and being with Christ are experienced as immediate.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
Plain statements on one side (death = unconsciousness, being with Lord requires resurrection) vs. Contextually Clear expressions of preference on the other. The plain didactic passages govern the reading of the ambiguous preference statements.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I8 -- Luke 23:43 and "Today in Paradise"

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR (paradise on crucifixion day): E51 (Luke 23:43 -- one reading places "today" with "paradise")
- AGAINST: E54 (John 20:17 -- Jesus has NOT YET ascended), E39 (death = sleep), E11 (thoughts perish at death)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E51 | Ambiguous | Greek has no punctuation. Both comma placements are grammatically valid. The reading depends on editorial punctuation. |
| E54 | Plain | Jesus' direct statement on resurrection morning: "I am not yet ascended to my Father." Unambiguous. |
| E39 | Plain | Death = sleep across 7+ authors. |
| E11 | Plain | Thoughts perish at death. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 1 Ambiguous item (E51 -- requires choosing a punctuation).
AGAINST: 3 Plain items (E54, E39, E11).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The plain statement of John 20:17 (Jesus had not ascended by Sunday) governs the ambiguous punctuation of Luke 23:43. The reading "I say unto thee today, thou shalt be with me in paradise" is consistent with all E-items. The reading "today thou shalt be with me in paradise" conflicts with E54.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
Plain statements on one side vs. a single ambiguous item requiring editorial punctuation on the other.

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases Scripture. Checked.
- Each uses plain lexical meaning without adding concepts. Checked.
- E-items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Checked.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- All E-items classified as Conditionalist (E11, E16, E17, E18, E19, E20, E21, E22, E28, E41, E42, E43, E44, E45) have full Tree 3 applications documented above.
- No E-items are classified as ECT. No ECT E-item was identified because no verse directly and didactically states that human souls consciously endure torment after death. (Passages commonly cited for this -- Luke 16:19-31, Rev 14:10-11, Rev 20:10 -- are not within the scope of this anthropology study and will be examined in dedicated etc studies.)
- All neutral E-items are textual observations both sides accept.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- Each N-item follows unavoidably from cited E-items. Checked.
- Three N-tier tests applied to each. All pass (documented above).
- N4 (death = cessation) is classified Conditionalist because one side must deny that these texts mean what they say to maintain their position.
- N5 (soul is mortal) is classified Conditionalist because ECT must redefine "die" to maintain soul immortality.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1 (immortal soul): Components NOT in E/N tables (concept "immortal soul" is absent) -> external -> I-C or I-D. Checked.
- I2 ("under the sun" limiter): External framework -> I-C or I-D. Does not override E-items directly -> I-C. Checked.
- I3 (conscious ruach): Adds concept not in E/N -> external -> I-C or I-D. Does not override E-items directly (compatible) -> I-C. Checked.
- I4 (holistic unity): All components in E/N -> text-derived. Checked.
- I5 (tripartism): Framework not in E/N -> external. Checked.
- I6 (bipartism): Framework not in E/N -> external. Checked.
- I7 (conscious intermediate state): Some E/N support both sides -> I-B. Checked.
- I8 (today in paradise): Textual tension -> I-B. Checked.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1: Requires E24 to NOT mean "only," E16 to NOT mean "die," E28 to NOT mean "destroy" -> conflicts -> I-D. Checked.
- I2: Does not require E-items to mean something else, just limits scope -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I3: Does not require E9 to mean something else, adds information -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I4: Does not require any E/N to mean something other than lexical value -> aligns -> I-A. Checked.
- I5: Does not override E/N -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I6: Does not override E/N -> compatible -> I-C. Checked.
- I7: Requires E40 to NOT mean being with Lord requires resurrection, OR requires E11/E19 to be limited -> conflicts -> I-B. Checked.
- I8: Requires choosing between punctuation readings -> I-B. Checked.

**Step E: Consistency checks.**
- I-A (I4): Requires only criterion #5 (systematizing). Confirmed.
- I-B (I7, I8): Both have E/N items on both sides. Confirmed.
- I-D (I1): Overrides E24, E16, E28, E11, E19. Confirmed.
- All I-C items (I2, I3, I5, I6): None overrides an E/N statement. Confirmed.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- 1 Cor 15:45 quoting Gen 2:7: verified textual connection (direct OT quotation). #4a applies.
- Ecc 12:7 reversing Gen 2:7: verified connection (shared vocabulary: aphar, shub, ruach). #4a applies.
- 2 Cor 5:4 echoing 1 Cor 15:53-54: verified connection (shared vocabulary: mortality swallowed up). #4a applies.
- Acts 17:25 echoing Gen 2:7: verified connection via LXX (pnoe = neshamah). #4a applies.

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture Explicitly States or Necessarily Implies)

1. Man was formed from dust and God breathed the breath of life (neshamah) into him, and man BECAME a living soul (nephesh chayyah) (Gen 2:7).
2. The same term nephesh chayyah is used for animals (Gen 1:20-21,24). The term does not distinguish humans from animals.
3. Animals and humans share the same ruach/breath (Ecc 3:19; Gen 7:22).
4. Man is dust and returns to dust at death (Gen 3:19; Ecc 12:7).
5. At death, dust returns to earth and ruach returns to God who gave it (Ecc 12:7).
6. When ruach departs, thoughts perish "in that very day" (Ps 146:4).
7. The dead know nothing, have no remembrance, no work, no knowledge, no wisdom (Ecc 9:5,10; Ps 6:5; 115:17).
8. The soul (nephesh) that sins dies (Ezek 18:4,20). God can destroy soul and body (Matt 10:28). The soul is mortal.
9. God ONLY (monos) has immortality (1 Tim 6:16). Man does not inherently possess immortality.
10. Immortality must be sought (Rom 2:7), put on at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54), and was brought to light through the gospel (2 Tim 1:10).
11. Man was barred from the tree of life to prevent living forever (Gen 3:22-24).
12. Death is described as "sleep" across seven or more biblical authors.
13. Being with the Lord is tied to resurrection (1 Thess 4:16-17).
14. The body without the spirit (pneuma) is dead (Jas 2:26).
15. Breath/spirit is given by God, not inherent to humans (Isa 42:5; Acts 17:25; Zec 12:1).

## What CANNOT Be Said (Not Explicitly Stated or Necessarily Implied by Scripture)

1. **It cannot be said that Scripture teaches humans have an "immortal soul."** The phrase never appears. The word athanasia is attributed only to God (1 Tim 6:16). The soul can die (Ezek 18:4) and be destroyed (Matt 10:28).
2. **It cannot be said that Scripture teaches the ruach/spirit carries consciousness after death.** Ps 146:4 states thoughts perish when ruach departs. The text does not describe the returning ruach as conscious.
3. **It cannot be said that Scripture teaches a conscious intermediate state between death and resurrection.** Paul ties being with the Lord to resurrection (1 Thess 4:16-17). His expressions of preference (2 Cor 5:8; Phil 1:23) do not describe the intermediate state.
4. **It cannot be said that Scripture prescribes a specific anthropological model (dichotomy, trichotomy, or monism).** 1 Thess 5:23 lists three terms; Mark 12:30 lists four; neither is a technical anatomy lesson. Scripture uses soul/spirit terminology flexibly.
5. **It cannot be said that Scripture limits Ecclesiastes death statements to an earthly perspective only.** No verse states this limitation. The phrase "under the sun" appears in Ecc 9:6, not in 9:5 or 9:10 or Ps 146:4 or Ps 6:5.
6. **It cannot be said that the nephesh/soul distinguishes humans from animals.** The same term is applied to both (Gen 1:20-24; 2:7). What distinguishes humans is the imago Dei (Gen 1:26-27; 9:6).
7. **It cannot be said that 2 Cor 5:8 describes a disembodied intermediate existence.** Paul expressly states he does NOT desire to be "unclothed" (5:4). His desire is to be "clothed upon" -- to receive the resurrection body. The Greek word *ependyomai* (G1902, "clothe upon") is a unique compound verb (only 2x in NT, both in 2 Cor 5) meaning to put on *over* what is already worn -- transformation, not exchange. The purpose clause "mortality swallowed up of life" (5:4) uses the same root (*katapino*) as 1 Cor 15:54, confirming the resurrection context. Paul's groaning (5:2,4) uses the same verb (*stenazomen*) as Romans 8:23, where the object is explicitly "the redemption of our body." See [Study 19](../etc-19-2-corinthians-5-intermediate-state/CONCLUSION.md) for detailed Greek analysis.

## Analysis

### The Creation Formula (Gen 2:7)
The creation of man follows a formula: dust (material) + breath of life from God (neshamah) = living soul (nephesh chayyah). Hebrew parsing confirms: hayah (Qal Wayyiqtol 3ms) means "became." Man did not receive a soul as a separate component; he became a living soul. The same term nephesh chayyah is applied to animals in Gen 1:20-21,24, establishing that nephesh is not the distinguishing feature of humanity. What distinguishes humans is the image of God (Gen 1:26-27; 9:6; Gen 5:1), not the possession of nephesh.

### The Semantic Range of Nephesh
With 780 occurrences and 214 distinct translations, nephesh functions across a vast semantic range: creature, life, person, self, appetite, desire, dead body, blood. The LXX maps it to psyche (~80%) but also to thanatos (death) when referring to corpses. The term nephesh meth ("dead soul/dead body") in Lev 21:11 and Num 6:6 demonstrates that nephesh is not inherently linked to consciousness or immortality. The nephesh IS the blood (Lev 17:11) -- a physical identification. The nephesh dies (Ezek 18:4,20). God can destroy it (Matt 10:28).

### Ruach, Neshamah, and Their Shared Application
Ruach (spirit/wind/breath, 434 occurrences) and neshamah (breath, 25 occurrences) overlap in usage. Gen 2:7 uses neshamah; Ecc 12:7 uses ruach. Gen 7:22 combines them: "neshamah of the ruach of life." Both terms apply to animals (Gen 6:17; 7:15,22; Ecc 3:19). Both are given by God (Isa 42:5; Acts 17:25; Zec 12:1). Both depart at death (Ecc 12:7; Ps 146:4; Job 34:14-15). The LXX distinguishes them: neshamah maps primarily to pnoe (G4157); ruach maps to pneuma (G4151). Neither is described as a conscious entity that survives death independently.

### Death as Reversal of Creation
The death process reverses Gen 2:7: dust returns to earth (Gen 3:19; Ecc 12:7), ruach returns to God (Ecc 12:7; Ps 104:29), and what remains is neither living nor conscious. Ps 146:4 specifies the timing: "in that very day his thoughts perish." Ecc 9:5 states: "the dead know not any thing." Multiple OT passages characterize death as silence (Ps 115:17), forgetfulness (Ps 88:12), absence of knowledge (Ecc 9:10), and cessation of activity (Job 3:17-18). Seven or more biblical authors call death "sleep" (Deut 31:16; Job 14:12; Dan 12:2; John 11:11; Acts 7:60; 1 Cor 15:51; 1 Thess 4:14).

### Immortality as Conditional Gift
Three Greek words define the biblical concept of immortality. Athanasia (deathlessness, 3 occurrences) belongs only to God (1 Tim 6:16) and must be "put on" by mortals at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54). Aphtharsia (incorruptibility, 8 occurrences) must be sought (Rom 2:7) and was brought to light through the gospel (2 Tim 1:10). Thnetos (mortal, 6 occurrences) describes the current human condition (Rom 6:12; 8:11; 1 Cor 15:53; 2 Cor 4:11; 5:4). Gen 3:22-24 confirms: man was barred from the tree of life specifically to prevent him from living forever.

### The NT and the OT Framework
The NT does not introduce a new anthropology. Paul quotes Gen 2:7 in 1 Cor 15:45. Acts 17:25 echoes Gen 2:7 and Isa 42:5. James 2:26 states the body without spirit is dead. Paul calls death "sleep" (1 Cor 15:51; 1 Thess 4:14) and ties being with the Lord to resurrection (1 Thess 4:16-17). The passages that might suggest a conscious intermediate state (2 Cor 5:1-9; Phil 1:23; Luke 23:43) express preference and expectation, not detailed descriptions of the intermediate state. 2 Cor 5:4 explicitly states Paul desires to be "clothed upon" (new body), not "unclothed" (to die). Detailed Greek analysis ([Study 19](../etc-19-2-corinthians-5-intermediate-state/CONCLUSION.md)) confirms that Paul's unique compound verb *ependyomai* (G1902, "put on over") describes receiving the resurrection body over the mortal body -- transformation, not a disembodied intermediate state.

### Soul and Spirit: Flexible, Not Technical
1 Thess 5:23 lists spirit, soul, and body. Heb 4:12 mentions dividing soul and spirit. Luke 1:46-47 uses soul and spirit in synonymous parallelism. Isa 26:9 does the same. Mark 12:30 lists heart, soul, mind, and strength. No passage prescribes a specific number of human components as doctrine. The terms are used flexibly, with overlapping semantic ranges, to describe different aspects of the whole person.

## Conclusion

This study examined 56 explicit statements, 7 necessary implications, and 8 inferences regarding biblical anthropology. The evidence hierarchy places explicit statements above necessary implications, which are above inferences.

15 explicit statements use cessation/death/destruction vocabulary applied to human beings at death (classified Conditionalist). 0 explicit statements use conscious-ongoing-existence vocabulary applied to literal human beings in a didactic context (no ECT E-items identified within this study's scope). 41 explicit statements are neutral textual observations accepted by all positions.

2 necessary implications are classified Conditionalist (death = cessation of cognitive activity; soul is mortal). 5 are neutral.

1 inference (I-A) extends the explicit evidence into a systematized holistic anthropology. 2 inferences (I-B) present competing textual claims; both resolved Strong toward the Conditionalist reading via SIS protocol. 4 inferences (I-C) are compatible external frameworks (Ecclesiastes scope-limiter, conscious ruach, tripartism, bipartism). 1 inference (I-D) requires overriding multiple E/N statements (the claim of an inherently immortal soul).
