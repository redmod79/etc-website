## Question

What does Scripture teach about human constitution? What is a human being according to the Bible — body, soul, spirit? Are these separate substances or aspects of one unity? Is the soul inherently immortal or mortal? Do animals have souls/spirits? How does the human constitution relate to what happens at death?

### 1. Explicit Statements Table (E Tier)

*E tier = what the text directly says. Both sides must acknowledge these as textual facts.*

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | "The LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." | Gen 2:7 |
| E2 | "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." | Gen 3:19 |
| E3 | "Lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever" — God bars access to the tree to prevent immortal life in fallen state. | Gen 3:22-24 |
| E4 | Sea creatures, birds, and land animals are called "living creature" (nephesh chayyah) in the creation account. | Gen 1:20, 21, 24 |
| E5 | Animals formed from the ground are called "living creature" (nephesh chayyah) — the same Hebrew construction applied to the human in Gen 2:7. | Gen 2:19 |
| E6 | "Let us make man in our image [tselem], after our likeness [demuth]." | Gen 1:26 |
| E7 | "God created man in his own image [tselem], in the image of God created he him." | Gen 1:27 |
| E8 | No animal is described with tselem (image of God) anywhere in Scripture. (17 occurrences of tselem: Gen 1:26,27; 5:3; 9:6; Num 33:52; 1 Sam 6:5; 2 Kgs 11:18; Psa 39:6; Ezk 7:20; 16:17; 23:14 — all human or idol/idol-contexts.) | Gen 1:26-27; 5:3; 9:6 (and absence from all animal passages) |
| E9 | In every creature — including all land animals — that died in the flood: "All in whose nostrils was the breath of life [neshamah + ruach], of all that was in the dry land, died." Both neshamah and ruach are applied to animals and humans together. | Gen 7:22 |
| E10 | "As the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath [ruach echad]; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast." | Ecc 3:19 |
| E11 | "All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again." Said of man and beast together. | Ecc 3:20 |
| E12 | "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit [ruach] shall return unto God who gave it." | Ecc 12:7 |
| E13 | "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish." | Psa 146:4 |
| E14 | "The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence." | Psa 115:17 |
| E15 | "For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?" | Psa 6:5 |
| E16 | The grave is called "the land of forgetfulness"; rhetorical questions in Psa 88:10-12 expect "no" as the answer: the dead do not arise and praise, lovingkindness is not declared in the grave, faithfulness is not in destruction, wonders are not known in the dark. | Psa 88:10-12 |
| E17 | "The dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten." | Ecc 9:5 |
| E18 | "Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun." | Ecc 9:6 |
| E19 | "There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest." | Ecc 9:10 |
| E20 | "Man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep." | Job 14:12 |
| E21 | "His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them." | Job 14:21 |
| E22 | "The grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee." | Isa 38:18-19 |
| E23 | "Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt." | Dan 12:2 |
| E24 | "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." (Stated twice.) | Ezk 18:4, 20 |
| E25 | "He shall save his soul alive" — soul can be saved from dying, implying it would otherwise die. | Ezk 18:27 |
| E26 | God "is able to destroy both soul [psyche] and body [soma] in hell [gehenna]." | Mat 10:28 |
| E27 | Men "kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul." | Mat 10:28 |
| E28 | "Every living soul [psyche zosa] died in the sea." | Rev 16:3 |
| E29 | "[God] who only [monos] hath immortality [athanasia], dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto." | 1 Tim 6:16 |
| E30 | Humans "seek" immortality [aphtharsia] — it is a goal to be attained. | Rom 2:7 |
| E31 | "This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality [athanasia]." | 1 Cor 15:53 |
| E32 | "When this mortal shall have put on immortality" — a future event at the resurrection. | 1 Cor 15:54 |
| E33 | "It is sown a natural [psychikos] body; it is raised a spiritual [pneumatikos] body." | 1 Cor 15:44 |
| E34 | "The first man Adam was made a living soul [psychen zosan]; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit [pneuma zoopoioun]." (Paul quotes LXX of Gen 2:7.) | 1 Cor 15:45 |
| E35 | "That was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual." | 1 Cor 15:46 |
| E36 | "The first man is of the earth, earthy [choikos]." | 1 Cor 15:47 |
| E37 | The body is called "this tabernacle" (tent) and "house of this tabernacle"; Paul desires not to be "unclothed" but "clothed upon" with the heavenly dwelling, "that mortality might be swallowed up of life." | 2 Cor 5:1-4 |
| E38 | Paul describes being "absent from the body" as being "present with the Lord" and calls this preferable. | 2 Cor 5:8 |
| E39 | Paul expresses "a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better." | Phil 1:23 |
| E40 | "Your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." Three terms used together. | 1 Th 5:23 |
| E41 | The word of God divides "soul and spirit" and "joints and marrow." Soul and spirit are paired as distinguishable. | Heb 4:12 |
| E42 | "As her soul was in departing, (for she died)" — soul departure = death. | Gen 35:18 |
| E43 | "Dead body" (nephesh met, dead soul) = a corpse. Nephesh is applied to a dead person/body. | Lev 21:11; Num 6:6 |
| E44 | God "formeth the spirit of man within him." | Zec 12:1 |
| E45 | "If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; all flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust." | Job 34:14-15 |
| E46 | "Thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust." | Psa 104:29 |
| E47 | Jesus said "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth" and the narrator clarifies "Howbeit Jesus spake of his death" and "Lazarus is dead." | Jhn 11:11-14 |
| E48 | "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." | Luk 23:46 |
| E49 | "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." | Acts 7:59 |
| E50 | "Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise." | Luk 23:43 |
| E51 | John sees in vision "under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God" crying out; they are told to "rest yet for a little season." | Rev 6:9-11 |
| E52 | "The spirits of just men made perfect" are listed among the assembly believers come to in Mount Zion / the heavenly Jerusalem. | Heb 12:23 |
| E53 | "Man became a living soul [nephesh chayyah]" — using the verb hayah (became), not a verb of receiving. | Gen 2:7 (Hebrew analysis) |
| E54 | G110 (athanasia, immortality) appears only 3 times in the NT: 1 Tim 6:16 (God alone has it); 1 Cor 15:53 (mortals must put it on); 1 Cor 15:54 (when mortal puts it on). | 1 Tim 6:16; 1 Cor 15:53-54 |
| E55 | G2349 (thnetos, mortal) describes the present human body in all 6 NT occurrences. | Rom 6:12; 8:11; 1 Cor 15:53-54; 2 Cor 4:11; 5:4 |
| E56 | "The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly." | Prov 20:27 |
| E57 | "There is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding." | Job 32:8 |
| E58 | In Luke 1:46-47, "soul" (psyche) and "spirit" (pneuma) appear in synonymous parallelism: "My soul doth magnify the Lord / And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour." | Luk 1:46-47 |
| E59 | "The body without the spirit is dead." | Jas 2:26 |
| E60 | "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image [tselem] of God made he man." Post-flood text confirms image of God still applies to humans after the fall. | Gen 9:6 |

### 2. Necessary Implications Table (N Tier)

*N tier = what unavoidably follows from explicit statements. Universal agreement test applied.*

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Man, in the creation formula, is the RESULT of two components combining, not the recipient of a pre-existing soul inserted into a body. The whole living person IS the nephesh. | E1, E53 | The verb "became" (hayah) combined with the result-indicating lamed prefix means the nephesh is not received but is what man becomes. Both sides must acknowledge the grammatical fact: man became a nephesh, not: man received a nephesh. |
| N2 | Nephesh (H5315) and ruach (H7307) are not uniquely human terms; they apply to animals as well. | E4, E5, E9, E10 | Four separate passages apply these terms to animals. Both sides must acknowledge this as lexical and textual fact. |
| N3 | Tselem (the image of God) is the one term in the creation vocabulary that is applied exclusively to humans and never to animals. | E6, E7, E8 | This is observable from a simple survey of all 17 occurrences of tselem. No animal is ever called tselem. Both sides must acknowledge this distribution. |
| N4 | At death, the process of Gen 2:7 reverses: the breath/spirit returns to God (Ecc 12:7) and the dust returns to earth (Gen 3:19; Psa 104:29). | E2, E12, E46 | Ecc 12:7 is the explicit statement of reversal. It uses the same verb "return" (shub) for both halves. Gen 3:19 states the dust-return. Psa 104:29 states breath-withdrawal = death. The reversal of the creation formula is the death formula. |
| N5 | God currently possesses immortality exclusively; no creature currently possesses it as an inherent attribute, according to the NT. | E29, E54 | 1 Tim 6:16 states God ALONE (monos) has athanasia. There are only 3 NT occurrences of the word; in the other two, mortals must PUT ON immortality at a future event. The word "only" is unqualified and both sides must acknowledge it. |
| N6 | Immortality (athanasia) is something mortals acquire at the resurrection, not at death or at birth. | E31, E32, E54, E55 | 1 Cor 15:53-54 explicitly says "this mortal MUST PUT ON immortality" — a future event. G2349 (thnetos, mortal) describes present humans in all 6 occurrences. The text itself states when it is received: at the resurrection transformation, not before. |
| N7 | The soul (nephesh in Ezk; psyche in Rev 16:3) can die. | E24, E28, E43 | Ezk 18:4 states the nephesh that sins shall die — the soul is the explicit grammatical subject of dying. Rev 16:3 states every living soul (psyche) died. Lev 21:11 and Num 6:6 use nephesh met (dead soul) for a corpse. These are textual facts both sides must acknowledge. |
| N8 | God possesses the authority to destroy both soul and body completely; the soul is not beyond God's destructive power. | E26, E27 | Mat 10:28 explicitly contrasts men's inability to kill the soul with God's ability to destroy both soul and body. Both sides must acknowledge the plain meaning: God CAN destroy the soul; only men cannot. |
| N9 | Death is described as sleep in Jesus' own words and in Paul's consistent teaching. | E47, E20, E23, E33 | Jesus equates "sleepeth" with "is dead" (Jhn 11:11-14). Paul consistently uses sleep-language for deceased believers (1 Cor 15:6,18,20,51; 1 Th 4:13-16). Dan 12:2 uses "sleep in the dust." Both sides must acknowledge the consistent use of this metaphor. |
| N10 | The present natural body (psychikos soma) is corruptible and mortal; it is the body that is buried. The resurrection body (pneumatikos soma) is raised incorruptible. | E31, E32, E33, E36, E37, E55 | 1 Cor 15:44,53-54 explicitly states this sequence: sown natural, raised spiritual; mortal puts on immortality at resurrection. Both sides must acknowledge the direction of transformation: from mortal to immortal, at resurrection. |
| N11 | The ruach/spirit in man is God's own animating breath — it belongs to him, was given by him, and returns to him. | E12, E45, E46, E44 | Ecc 12:7: spirit "returns to God WHO GAVE IT" — God is the owner. Job 34:14: "his spirit and his breath" — possessive of God. Psa 104:29: "takest away their breath." Zec 12:1: God "formeth the spirit within man." These together establish divine ownership. |
| N12 | Humans must "seek" immortality because they do not currently possess it. | E30 | Rom 2:7 says humans seek immortality. A being that already possesses something does not seek it. The seeking implies present lack. |

### 3. Inferences Table (4-Type Taxonomy)

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that humans are a psychosomatic unity — an indivisible whole person — not a body housing a separable soul-substance. | I-A | Gen 2:7 (man became a nephesh — E1, E53); Jas 2:26 (body without spirit = dead — E59); 1 Th 5:23 (spirit, soul, body together = the whole person — E40); Lev 21:11 (nephesh met = corpse — E43). The creation formula and the death formula both treat the whole person as the unit. | No single verse states "humans are a psychosomatic unity." This systematizes E1, E53, E59, E40 into an anthropological framework. The claim is derived entirely from E/N items but goes beyond any single verse. | #5 (systematizing multiple E/N items) |
| I2 | The Bible teaches that the soul/nephesh is the whole living person, not an immaterial component added to the body. | I-A | Gen 2:7 (man BECAME a nephesh — E1, E53); Gen 1:20,21,24 (animals are nephesh — E4); Lev 21:11 (dead body is nephesh met — E43); Ecc 9:5 (the dead know nothing — E17). Nephesh denotes the whole living being. | The claim that nephesh = "whole person" rather than "immaterial soul" requires synthesizing all the usage data into a categorical conclusion. The data supports it, but the categorical claim goes beyond any single statement. | #5 (systematizing); optionally #4a (SIS: Gen 2:7 → Lev 21:11) |
| I3 | The Bible teaches that humans do not possess an inherently immortal soul; the soul is mortal until God grants immortality at the resurrection. | I-A | E24 (nephesh that sins shall die); E26 (God can destroy soul and body); E28 (every living psyche died); E29 (God alone has immortality); E31 (mortal must put on immortality); N5 (God alone currently has immortality); N6 (immortality acquired at resurrection); N7 (soul can die); N12 (humans seek immortality). | No single verse states "humans do not possess an inherently immortal soul." This is the systematic conclusion of E/N evidence from multiple passages and both testaments. All components are in the E/N tables. | #5 (systematizing); only I-A because the direction aligns with all E/N statements |
| I4 | The Bible teaches that the distinguishing feature of humans relative to animals is the image of God (tselem/eikon), not the possession of nephesh or ruach. | I-A | E3, E6, E7, E8 (image of God exclusively human); N3 (tselem never applied to animals); E4, E5, E9, E10 (nephesh/ruach shared with animals); N2 (nephesh/ruach not uniquely human). | The claim that "image of God = the distinguishing feature" is derived entirely from: (a) image is uniquely human; (b) nephesh/ruach are shared. The combination produces the conclusion but no single verse states it categorically. | #5 (systematizing N2, N3, E6-E10) |
| I5 | The Bible teaches that the state of the dead is unconscious — a state of complete unawareness — until the resurrection. | I-A | E13 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4); E17 (dead know not any thing — Ecc 9:5); E18-19 (love, hatred, envy perished; no work/knowledge in the grave — Ecc 9:6,10); E20-21 (man lies down, rises not; knoweth it not — Job 14:12,21); E14,15,16,22 (dead do not praise, no remembrance, land of forgetfulness, grave cannot praise — Psa 115:17; 6:5; 88:10-12; Isa 38:18-19); N9 (death = sleep consistently). | No single verse states "the dead are in a state of unconsciousness." This is the systematic conclusion of the accumulated E/N pattern across Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Job, Isaiah, and the NT sleep texts. All components are E/N items. | #5 (systematizing); #4a (SIS: explicit Ecc 9:5 interprets the sleep metaphor) |
| I6 | The image of God in humans consists primarily in relational/functional representation (dominion over creation as God's vice-regent) rather than in a specific soul-substance. | I-A | E6, E7 (image + dominion linked in Gen 1:26-28); E60 (post-flood image still grounds human dignity — Gen 9:6); 2 Cor 3:18; Col 3:10 (being renewed in/into the image). | No verse explicitly defines what the image consists in. The claim that it is relational/functional rather than a soul-substance is a theological synthesis of the evidence, derived from E items but requiring the choice to categorize it. All components are in E/N or directly observable. Requires #5 (systematizing). | #5 (systematizing E6, E7, E60 with dominion context) |
| I7 | The Bible teaches a conscious intermediate state for the righteous — a state of being "with Christ" or "with the Lord" between death and resurrection. | I-B | FOR: E38 (absent from body = present with Lord — 2 Cor 5:8); E39 (to depart = to be with Christ — Phil 1:23); E50 (today with me in paradise — Luk 23:43); E51 (souls under altar cry out — Rev 6:9-11); E52 (spirits of just men made perfect — Heb 12:23). AGAINST: E20 (man lies down, rises not, sleep until heavens no more — Job 14:12); E17 (dead know not any thing — Ecc 9:5); E13 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4); N5 (God alone has immortality); N6 (immortality at resurrection, not at death); N9 (death = sleep consistently). | No verse explicitly states "there is a conscious intermediate state between death and resurrection." Phil 1:23 and 2 Cor 5:8 are interpreted as implying it; the state-of-the-dead passages are interpreted as describing earthly activity, not the intermediate state. Both sets of E/N items are genuine. The resolution requires choosing how to integrate them. | #2 (choosing between possible readings of "depart and be with Christ" and "dead know not any thing"); #5 (systematizing into a doctrine) |
| I8 | The "dead know not any thing" language in Ecclesiastes is limited to earthly affairs "under the sun" and does not address the state of the spirit in God's presence (per Ecc 12:7). | I-B | FOR this qualifier: E12 (spirit returns to God — Ecc 12:7); E18 (dead have no more portion in things done "under the sun" — Ecc 9:6, which itself uses the qualifier); E52 (spirits of just men made perfect — Heb 12:23); E39 (depart to be with Christ — Phil 1:23). AGAINST: E17 (dead know not any thing — unqualified in v.5); E13 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4, no "under the sun" qualifier). | The claim that Ecclesiastes 9:5 is limited to earthly perspective requires applying the "under the sun" qualifier (which appears in v.6 and throughout Ecclesiastes) to restrict v.5's absolute-sounding statement. This requires: (a) recognizing the book-level hermeneutic of "under the sun"; (b) deciding whether v.5's "dead know not any thing" is also limited by this frame. Verse 5 itself does not contain the qualifier; it must be imported from context. | #3 (applying the "under the sun" framework to qualify the absolute statement); #2 (choosing whether the qualifier applies to v.5) |
| I9 | Human beings consist of three distinct substances: spirit, soul, and body (trichotomy). | I-B | FOR: E40 (spirit and soul and body — 1 Th 5:23 three terms); E41 (word divides soul and spirit — Heb 4:12). AGAINST: E58 (soul and spirit used as synonymous parallels — Luk 1:46-47); E1 (man became one nephesh — Gen 2:7, not two components); N1 (man is the result of two components, not three — dust + breath). | No verse states "humans have three distinct substances." 1 Th 5:23 uses three terms but in a benediction for the whole person; Heb 4:12 distinguishes them without establishing separate substances. The claim requires inferring distinct substances from the use of distinct terms, which is not logically required. | #2 (choosing between "three terms = three substances" vs. "three terms = totality of the person"); #5 (systematizing into an ontological claim) |
| I10 | Human beings consist of two distinct substances: an immaterial soul/spirit and a material body (substance dualism / dichotomy). | I-B | FOR: E41 (word divides soul and spirit from body — Heb 4:12); E38 (absent from body = present with Lord — 2 Cor 5:8); E39 (depart and be with Christ — Phil 1:23); E48, E49 (spirit commended to God at death — Luk 23:46; Acts 7:59). AGAINST: E1, E53 (man became a nephesh — the whole is the soul, not the soul is a part — Gen 2:7); N1 (man is the result, not recipient, of his soul); E59 (body without spirit = dead — Jas 2:26, not: spirit continues after body dies). | No verse states "humans consist of two distinct metaphysical substances." The substance dualist reading of Heb 4:12, 2 Cor 5:8, and Phil 1:23 requires inferring ontological separateness from functional or experiential statements. Gen 2:7's creation formula and the death formula work against substance dualism. | #2 (choosing between "distinct concepts" and "distinct substances"); #5 (systematizing into an ontological claim) |
| I11 | The "spirit returns to God" in Ecc 12:7 means a conscious personal entity (the soul of the person) goes to God in a state of awareness at death. | I-B | FOR: E12 (spirit returns to God who gave it — Ecc 12:7); E48, E49 (spirit commended to God at death — Luk 23:46; Acts 7:59); E39 (depart to be with Christ — Phil 1:23); E52 (spirits of just men made perfect — Heb 12:23). AGAINST: E11 (all — man and beast — go to one place, dust — Ecc 3:20); E10 (man and beast share one ruach — Ecc 3:19); E13 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4); N4 (death = reversal of creation formula; spirit returns = breath returns to source). The ruach applies to animals too (E9, E10), making a "personal conscious entity" reading problematic if applied consistently. | The text says the spirit "returns to God who gave it." It does not say the spirit continues in conscious personal existence at God. The conditionalist reading (ruach = life-force returning to its divine source) and the ECT-compatible reading (conscious soul going to God) are both possible readings. The resolution requires determining whether ruach in Ecc 12:7 refers to a conscious personal entity or the animating life-principle. | #2 (choosing between two possible meanings of "spirit returns to God"); #4b (connecting Ecc 12:7 to Phil 1:23 is a cross-reference without verified textual connection between the two passages) |
| I12 | The sleep metaphor for death implies unconsciousness in the intermediate state. | I-A | E47 (Jesus: "Lazarus sleepeth" = "Lazarus is dead" — Jhn 11:11-14); E20 (man lies down, rises not, till no more heavens — Job 14:12); E23 (sleep in the dust of the earth — Dan 12:2); N9 (death = sleep consistently across authors/testaments). | No verse states "the sleep metaphor proves unconsciousness." The claim that the metaphor implies unconsciousness requires inferring that the properties of natural sleep (unconsciousness, unawareness) carry over to the metaphor. This is I-A because it derives entirely from E/N items (the pattern of the metaphor) and extends them into an interpretive conclusion. | #5 (systematizing the pattern); #4a (SIS: Ecc 9:5 explicitly states "the dead know not any thing," which interprets the sleep metaphor) |
| I13 | The soul has no conscious existence between death and resurrection because all of the soul-components return to their source (dust to earth, spirit to God), leaving no continuing entity. | I-A | E2 (dust to dust — Gen 3:19); E12 (spirit to God — Ecc 12:7); E13 (thoughts perish — Psa 146:4); E17 (dead know not any thing — Ecc 9:5); N1 (man is the result of two components; separation = dissolution); N4 (death reverses creation formula). | This conditionalist synthesis requires combining E/N items into a comprehensive claim about the absence of any continuing conscious entity. All components are in E/N tables. No single verse states this conclusion. | #5 (systematizing multiple E/N items into a positive anthropological claim) |
| I14 | The language of "absent from the body, present with the Lord" (2 Cor 5:8) and "depart and be with Christ" (Phil 1:23) describes an instantaneous subjective experience from the perspective of the dead (who experience no interval), not an objectively continuous intermediate conscious state. | I-C | 2 Cor 5:8 (absent from body = present with Lord — E38); Phil 1:23 (depart = be with Christ — E39). These texts say what they say. The conditionalist interpretation that resolves the tension adds the concept of "subjective time from the dead person's perspective" — a concept not stated in the texts. | This claim adds an external philosophical concept (subjective vs. objective time; the dead person's perspective on an unconscious interval) that is not found anywhere in the E/N tables. It is not derived from Scripture but from a conceptual framework applied to resolve the tension between E38/E39 and E17-E22. This is external to the text. | #3 (applying a philosophical framework about subjective time); #1 (adding a concept the text does not state) |
| I15 | Humans possess an immortal soul that survives death and continues in conscious existence, separate from the body. | I-D | Gen 2:7: man BECAME a nephesh (E1, E53) — this formation language does not describe a pre-existing or indestructible soul. 1 Tim 6:16: God ALONE has immortality (E29, N5). 1 Cor 15:53: mortals must PUT ON immortality at resurrection (E31, N6). Ezk 18:4: the soul that sins shall die (E24, N7). Mat 10:28: God can destroy the soul (E26, E27, N8). | The claim that humans possess an inherently immortal soul conflicts with E29/N5 (God alone has immortality), E31/N6 (immortality acquired at resurrection, not at death or birth), E24/N7 (soul can die), and E26/N8 (God can destroy the soul). To maintain this claim, E29 must be reread (monos = "in a pre-eminent sense, not exclusively"), E31 must be limited (only the body puts on immortality), and E24 must be spiritualized (death = spiritual separation). All these rereadings require overriding the plain lexical values of the E statements. | #1 (adding concept of "inherent/self-existent immortality" not stated anywhere); #2 (requires choosing qualified readings of monos, athanasia, tamut that differ from their plain lexical values); #3 (applies Platonic immortality framework); overrides E29, N5, E31, N6, E24, E26 |
| I16 | The "soul that sins shall die" (Ezk 18:4) refers only to physical death of the body, not the death of any surviving soul. | I-D | Ezk 18:4 states nephesh is the grammatical subject of dying (E24). Rev 16:3 states every living psyche died (E28). Lev 21:11 and Num 6:6 use nephesh met for a corpse (E43) — the soul itself is what is dead. Mat 10:28 states God can destroy the soul (E26). | This claim requires the nephesh that is said to die to be understood as "only the body" despite nephesh being the grammatical subject of the death predicate. It overrides E24 (the nephesh dies) by restricting "death" to a scope the text does not specify. It also conflicts with E28 (every living psyche died — not: every body died) and E43 (nephesh met = the dead soul IS the corpse). | #1 (adding a restriction "only physical" not stated in the text); #2 (choosing a qualified reading of "die" that the Hebrew tamut does not specify); overrides E24, E28, E43, N7 |

### I-B Resolution Sections

#### I-B Resolution: I7 — Conscious intermediate state for the righteous

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR: E38 (absent from body = present with Lord — 2 Cor 5:8); E39 (to depart = to be with Christ — Phil 1:23); E50 (today with me in paradise — Luk 23:43); E51 (souls under altar cry out — Rev 6:9-11); E52 (spirits of just men made perfect — Heb 12:23)
- AGAINST: E20 (man lies down, rises not, sleep until heavens be no more — Job 14:12); E17 (dead know not any thing — Ecc 9:5); E13 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4); E14 (dead do not praise the LORD — Psa 115:17); N5 (God alone has immortality); N6 (immortality at resurrection); N9 (death = sleep consistently)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E39 (Phil 1:23: depart = be with Christ) | Plain | Didactic epistolary context; Paul directly states his expectation; straightforward propositional language; no figurative marker |
| E38 (2 Cor 5:8: absent from body = present with Lord) | Contextually Clear | Didactic epistolary; but the verse sits within a passage (2 Cor 5:1-8) that expresses tension and desire for the resurrection body, making the exact scope of "absent from body" require contextual awareness |
| E50 (Luk 23:43: today in paradise) | Plain | Direct speech by Jesus; the word "today" is unambiguous in the standard reading |
| E51 (Rev 6:9-11: souls under the altar) | Ambiguous | Apocalyptic genre; symbolic imagery; the "souls crying out" is structurally parallel to Abel's blood crying (Gen 4:10), which is clearly figurative; told to "rest" |
| E52 (Heb 12:23: spirits of just men made perfect) | Ambiguous | "Made perfect" (teleioo) is used in Heb 11:40 for the eschatological completion awaiting resurrection; the scene may be the final state, not intermediate |
| E17 (Ecc 9:5: dead know not any thing) | Plain | Didactic/wisdom context; direct, unqualified propositional statement about the dead's knowledge; no figurative marker |
| E13 (Psa 146:4: thoughts perish that very day) | Plain | Wisdom/didactic psalm; direct propositional statement; "that very day" specifies timing; vocabulary of perishing (abad) is explicit |
| E20 (Job 14:12: man lies down, rises not until heavens no more) | Plain | Direct statement about the duration of death-as-sleep; "they shall not awake" = no intermediate awakening |
| N9 (death = sleep) | Contextually Clear | The metaphor appears consistently across authors/testaments; Jesus equates it with "is dead"; Paul uses it for deceased believers throughout 1 Cor 15 and 1 Th 4 |

**Step 3 — Weight:**

FOR the conscious intermediate state: Two Plain items (E39, E50) and one Contextually Clear item (E38). Two Ambiguous items (E51, E52) that could go either way.

AGAINST: Three Plain items (E17, E13, E20) plus Contextually Clear N9. The Plain statements against are more numerous and come from multiple authors (Qohelet, the psalmist, Job) and genres (wisdom, poetry).

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**

The plain statement "the dead know not any thing" (E17, Ecc 9:5) and "thoughts perish that very day" (E13, Psa 146:4) are didactic, universal-scope statements about the state of all dead. They are maximally clear by the criteria: direct vocabulary, didactic genre, universal scope, and unqualified form.

Phil 1:23 (E39) and 2 Cor 5:8 (E38) are also didactic, but they address Paul's subjective expectation and desire, not a universal doctrinal statement about the state of all dead. They do not use "consciousness" vocabulary; they describe a relational outcome (with Christ) without specifying whether that involves continuous conscious awareness in an interval or points to the resurrection event.

Applying SIS: The plain statements about the dead having no knowledge, thoughts perishing, and remaining in sleep until resurrection are clear and universal. They set the framework. Phil 1:23's "depart and be with Christ" is ambiguous as to the mechanism and timing (instantaneous subjective, intermediate conscious, or pointing to the resurrection as the moment of "being with Christ"). The plain passages should determine how the ambiguous ones are read, not the reverse.

However, E50 (Luk 23:43: "today shalt thou be with me in paradise") is itself a Plain item in a non-apocalyptic, non-parabolic context (direct speech of Jesus). This plain item FOR the conscious intermediate state creates genuine weight on the other side. The tension between E50 and E17/E13/E20 is the core of the debate.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Unresolved**

Plain statements exist on both sides of this I-B inference:
- FOR: E39 (Phil 1:23), E50 (Luk 23:43) — plain items
- AGAINST: E17 (Ecc 9:5), E13 (Psa 146:4), E20 (Job 14:12) — plain items

The existence of plain statements on both sides means this cannot be resolved by SIS alone. The inference remains I-B Unresolved within the scope of this study. Dedicated studies on the intermediate state (and on specific passages like Phil 1:23, Luk 23:43, and Rev 6:9-11) will accumulate additional evidence. This study establishes the tension; it does not resolve it.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I8 — "Dead know not any thing" limited to earthly affairs

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR this qualifier: E18 (Ecc 9:6 uses "under the sun" — though as a qualifier on the dead's "portion," it is within the verse that follows v.5's absolute statement); E12 (spirit returns to God — Ecc 12:7); the book-level "under the sun" frame of Ecclesiastes
- AGAINST: E17 (Ecc 9:5 itself contains no "under the sun" qualifier); E13 (Psa 146:4: "thoughts perish that very day" — no qualifier in a different book); E14, E15, E16, E22 (multiple passages from Psalms and Isaiah make similar statements without any "under the sun" frame)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E17 (Ecc 9:5: dead know not any thing) | Plain | The statement in v.5 contains no qualifier; it is in a direct propositional form |
| "Under the sun" qualifier in v.6 | Ambiguous | The qualifier in v.6 restricts the dead's "portion" to things under the sun; it is uncertain whether this restriction also governs v.5's "know not any thing" |
| E13 (Psa 146:4) | Plain | A different author (psalmist) in a different genre; no "under the sun" frame; thoughts perish that very day — unqualified |
| E14, E15, E16, E22 | Plain/Contextually Clear | Multiple independent witnesses across Psalms and Isaiah with no "under the sun" framing |

**Step 3 — Weight:**

The qualifier depends on importing the "under the sun" frame from Ecclesiastes's literary structure into verse 5, which does not contain it. Ecclesiastes 9:5's absolute statement is supported by four to five independent witnesses from different books (Psalms, Isaiah, Job) with no such qualifier. The "under the sun" restriction requires applying an external literary framework that is not present in the other supporting passages.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**

The multiple plain, unqualified statements from Psalms and Isaiah (E13, E14, E15, E16, E22) — which make the same observation without any "under the sun" limitation — interpret Ecclesiastes 9:5. When multiple independent passages (different authors, different genres, different situations) converge on the same statement without qualifying frameworks, the qualified reading of one passage is the less certain one.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate** (weight on the side that "dead know not any thing" is not restricted to the earthly perspective)

The "under the sun" qualifier does apply to Ecclesiastes 9:6 (by the text itself) but is not contained in Ecclesiastes 9:5. The parallel passages from Psalms and Isaiah make the same observation without any qualifier. The moderate resolution is that the absolute statement in Ecc 9:5 about the dead's lack of knowledge is not restricted to earthly affairs only, though the "under the sun" frame of Ecclesiastes as a whole adds relevant context that informs the book's argument.

#### I-B Resolution: I9 — Trichotomy (spirit, soul, and body as three distinct substances)

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR trichotomy: E40 (1 Th 5:23: three terms — spirit, soul, body); E41 (Heb 4:12: word divides soul and spirit)
- AGAINST: E58 (Luk 1:46-47: soul and spirit used as synonymous parallels in Hebrew poetry); E1, E53 (man became one nephesh — Gen 2:7 shows a two-component formula: dust + breath = one result); N1 (man is the result of combining two things, not three)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E40 (1 Th 5:23: three terms) | Contextually Clear | Didactic epistle; but the context is a benediction for "wholeness" ("wholly"), not an ontological definition |
| E41 (Heb 4:12: divides soul and spirit) | Ambiguous | Didactic epistle; but "joints and marrow" is also listed as separable, yet no one claims ontological separation of joints/marrow |
| E58 (Luk 1:46-47: synonymous parallelism) | Plain | Hebrew poetic genre; synonymous parallelism is unambiguous in this context — soul/spirit are interchangeable in the Magnificat |
| E1, E53 (Gen 2:7: two-component formula) | Plain | Narrative; man is formed from two things: dust + breath. The result is one nephesh. The formula does not have three components. |

**Step 3 — Weight:**

The plain evidence (E58's synonymous parallelism; E1/E53's two-component formula) works against strict trichotomy. The contextually clear (E40) and ambiguous (E41) items support a distinction between soul and spirit but do not establish three ontologically separate substances. 1 Th 5:23's use of three terms in a totality-benediction is contextually clear, not ontologically definitional.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**

The creation formula (E1, E53) is the primary text on human constitution, and it yields a two-component formula (dust + breath → one person). Luke 1:46-47 is explicit synonymous parallelism showing soul and spirit used interchangeably. These plain passages should interpret the ambiguous use of three terms in 1 Th 5:23 — which emphasizes totality ("wholly"), not substance categories.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate** (weight against trichotomy as a doctrine of three distinct ontological substances)

The evidence moderately favors against strict ontological trichotomy. The three terms in 1 Th 5:23 describe the whole person comprehensively; they do not establish three distinct substances. Dichotomy (two substances) has more textual support than trichotomy, though the nature of that duality is debated (see I10). The holistic unity view (I1) has the strongest E/N support.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I10 — Substance dualism / dichotomy (soul and body as two distinct substances)

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR: E41 (Heb 4:12: divides soul and spirit); E38, E39 (absent from body = present with Lord; depart = be with Christ — 2 Cor 5:8; Phil 1:23); E48, E49 (spirit commended to God at death — Luk 23:46; Acts 7:59)
- AGAINST: E1, E53 (man became a nephesh — not received one — Gen 2:7); N1 (man is the result, not recipient, of his soul); E59 (body without spirit = dead — Jas 2:26); E43 (nephesh met = corpse); N7 (soul can die)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E1, E53 (Gen 2:7: became a nephesh) | Plain | Narrative; grammatical analysis confirms "became" not "received"; lamed + hayah formula |
| N1 (result vs. recipient) | — | Necessary implication of E1/E53; not questionable |
| E38 (2 Cor 5:8) | Contextually Clear | Didactic; but requires contextual awareness: Paul fears being naked/bodiless; his desire is resurrection |
| E39 (Phil 1:23) | Plain | Didactic; direct expression of Paul's expectation about death |
| E59 (Jas 2:26) | Plain | Wisdom/didactic; "body without spirit is dead" — functional statement |
| E48, E49 (spirit commended to God) | Contextually Clear | These are specific acts at death, consistent with Ecc 12:7's "returns to God who gave it"; compatible with either view |

**Step 3 — Weight:**

The substance dualist reading requires the spirit/soul to be a separable entity that survives the death of the body. Against this: Gen 2:7 shows man becomes a nephesh (not receives one), which makes the nephesh the whole person rather than a separable component. Jas 2:26 ("body without spirit = dead") is a functional statement: when the spirit departs, the body is dead — it does not say the spirit continues as a conscious entity elsewhere.

For the substance dualist reading: Phil 1:23 (E39) is the strongest — Paul clearly expects to be with Christ after death. This requires some form of post-death existence.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**

The creation formula (Gen 2:7) is the primary anthropological text. It establishes the human person as a psychosomatic unity, not a soul resident in a body. The plain functional statement (Jas 2:26) does not establish what happens to the spirit after it departs — only that its departure results in death. Phil 1:23 establishes post-death presence with Christ but does not establish substance dualism; it could be interpreted as pointing to the resurrection as the event of "being with Christ."

**Step 5 — Resolution: Unresolved**

Phil 1:23 (plain) creates genuine weight for post-death conscious existence. Gen 2:7's formula (plain) works against a separable soul-substance. These are not fully resolved by SIS within this study. The intermediate state question (related to I7) intersects with this question. This study establishes the parameters; full resolution requires the dedicated intermediate-state study (etc5-XX).

---

#### I-B Resolution: I11 — "Spirit returns to God" = conscious person going to God

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR conscious entity: E48, E49 (spirit commended to God at death — Luk 23:46; Acts 7:59); E39 (depart = be with Christ — Phil 1:23); E12 (spirit returns to God who gave it — Ecc 12:7 — "given by God" implies personal relationship)
- AGAINST: E10, E11 (man and beast share one ruach; all go to dust — Ecc 3:19-20); N11 (ruach belongs to God, is God's animating breath, not a separate conscious entity); E13 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4, simultaneous with ruach departure)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E12 (Ecc 12:7: spirit returns to God) | Ambiguous | Does not specify conscious vs. unconscious state; "returns" indicates source; compatible with either reading |
| E10 (man and beast share one ruach — Ecc 3:19) | Plain | Didactic/wisdom; directly states shared ruach between man and animal |
| E13 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4) | Plain | Simultaneous with ruach departure; thoughts perish when ruach departs |
| E48, E49 (spirit commended to God) | Contextually Clear | Acts of entrusting at death; consistent with Ecc 12:7; do not specify conscious state |

**Step 3 — Weight:**

If ruach = a personal conscious entity going to God, this applies equally to animals (E10: man and beast share one ruach, both come from dust). But the claim that animal ruach = a conscious personal entity surviving death is not made anywhere in Scripture and would create new problems. The shared-ruach observation (E10) makes the "conscious personal entity" reading of Ecc 12:7's ruach difficult to maintain consistently.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**

The plain statement that man and beast share one ruach (E10) and that thoughts perish when ruach departs (E13) contextualizes how Ecc 12:7's "spirit returns to God" should be read. The ruach returning to God is the life-force that God gave, returning to its source — not necessarily a surviving conscious person.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate** (weight toward "spirit returns to God" = the animating breath/life-force returning to its source, not a conscious surviving person)

The shared-ruach with animals (E10) and the simultaneous thought-perishing (E13) moderately favor the conditionalist reading of Ecc 12:7. The ECT-compatible reading requires the ruach in Ecc 12:7 to mean something categorically different from the ruach in Ecc 3:19 (where it is shared with animals), without textual warrant for that distinction within Ecclesiastes itself.

---

### 4. Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements:**

- Each E-statement has been reviewed against the actual verse text. Statements E1-E60 are all direct quotes or close paraphrases of actual verse text.
- E8 (no animal described with tselem) is an observational textual fact from surveying all 17 occurrences of tselem — a legitimate E-statement about what the text says and does not say.
- E53 (analysis of "became" in Gen 2:7) is based on morphological analysis; it is what the text grammatically says. Legitimate E-statement.
- E54, E55 (occurrence counts of athanasia and thnetos) are factual observations about the text. Legitimate.
- No E-items appear to be positional inferences. All are textual observations both sides must acknowledge.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications:**

- N1 (man is the result of two components): Tested. Does it require interpretation? The verb "became" (confirmed by morphological analysis) is the key. Could an ECT proponent deny N1 while accepting E1? They could argue man received the soul within the process, but the grammatical form says "became." N1 passes the universal agreement test with the caveat that it is grammatical analysis — both sides must accept the grammar.
- N2 (nephesh/ruach apply to animals): Passes all three tests — four explicit verses confirm this, no interpretation needed.
- N3 (tselem never applied to animals): Passes — observable survey fact.
- N4 (death reverses creation formula): Passes — both verses explicitly state the components reversing.
- N5 (God alone has immortality): Passes — monos (alone) is the explicit word in 1 Tim 6:16; the text says "only."
- N6 (immortality at resurrection): Passes — "must put on" at resurrection is the explicit statement.
- N7 (soul can die): Passes — Ezk 18:4 and Rev 16:3 explicitly state this.
- N8 (God can destroy soul): Passes — Mat 10:28 explicitly states this.
- N9 (death = sleep): Passes — Jesus equates sleep with death; the pattern is confirmed across multiple texts.
- N10 (mortal body buried; spiritual body raised): Passes — explicit in 1 Cor 15.
- N11 (ruach belongs to God): Passes — Ecc 12:7 "given by him"; Job 34:14 "his spirit and his breath"; Psa 104:29 "thy breath."
- N12 (humans seek immortality): Passes — seeking implies not yet having.

All N items pass the three-question test. None require defense; all follow directly from the cited E statements.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test):**

- I1 through I6: All components are in E/N tables. All I-A classifications confirmed.
- I7 (conscious intermediate state): E38, E39, E50, E51, E52 are FOR; E17, E13, E20, N5, N6, N9 are AGAINST. I-B confirmed.
- I8 (under the sun qualifier): E18 is in E table; E17 is in E table. The external element is the "under the sun" hermeneutical framework imported from Ecclesiastes's structure into v.5. One side requires criterion #3 (external framework). I-B confirmed with criterion #3 on the qualifying side.
- I9, I10, I11: All components are in E/N tables on both sides. I-B confirmed.
- I12, I13: All components in E/N tables. I-A confirmed.
- I14: The "subjective time" concept is NOT in any E/N table. It is an external philosophical concept. I-C confirmed (compatible with E but not derived from E).
- I15 (inherently immortal soul): Conflicts with E29 (God alone has immortality), E31 (must put on), E24 (soul dies). I-D confirmed — requires overriding multiple E/N statements.
- I16 (soul that sins = only physical death of body): Conflicts with E24 (nephesh is the grammatical subject of dying), E28 (every living psyche died), E43 (nephesh met = corpse). I-D confirmed.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test):**

- I15: Requires E29's "only" (monos) to mean "pre-eminently" rather than "exclusively." Requires E24's "die" to mean "physical death only." Requires E31's future "put on" to mean "the body only puts on, the soul already has." All of these require the relevant E statements to mean something other than their lexical values. I-D confirmed.
- I16: Requires E24's "the soul that sins, it shall die" (nephesh is subject) to mean "the body of the person shall die." Nephesh is the stated subject; redefining the subject requires overriding the lexical value. I-D confirmed.

**Step E: Consistency checks:**

- I-A items (I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I12, I13): Each requires criterion #5 (systematizing). None require #1, #2, or #3 independently. Confirmed I-A.
- I-B items (I7, I8, I9, I10, I11): Each has E/N on both sides. Confirmed I-B.
- I-C (I14): Does not override any E/N statement (conditionalist claim that E38/E39 describe subjective instantaneous experience does not deny E38/E39; it adds an interpretive concept). Does not derive from E/N tables (the subjective-time concept). Confirmed I-C.
- I-D (I15, I16): Each overrides at least one E/N statement. Confirmed I-D.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections:**

- I-B Resolution I11 uses E10 (shared ruach with animals — Ecc 3:19) to contextualize Ecc 12:7. Connection is verified: same author (Qohelet), same book (Ecclesiastes), same chapter context. This is a #4a connection (SIS with verified textual connection). Documented.
- I-B Resolution I8 uses Psalms and Isaiah passages to interpret Ecclesiastes 9:5. Connection: shared concept (death, knowledge, the dead) but different authors. This is a #4b connection — cross-referencing without textual linkage. The resolution rests on frequency and uniformity of the unqualified statements across multiple independent authors, which is the "Frequency" clarity criterion (#4 in the methodology's clarity criteria list).

### 7. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**

- Man was formed from dust and the breath of God and became a living soul; the whole person is the nephesh. (E1, E53, N1)
- At death, the process reverses: dust returns to earth, breath/spirit returns to God who gave it. (E2, E12, N4)
- Nephesh (H5315) and ruach (H7307) are terms applied to both animals and humans throughout the OT. (E4, E5, E9, E10, N2)
- Tselem (image of God) is applied exclusively to humans and never to any animal in any biblical passage. (E6, E7, E8, N3)
- The soul (nephesh/psyche) can die; it is not described as indestructible. (E24, E28, E43, N7)
- God can destroy both soul and body; humans cannot destroy the soul but God can. (E26, E27, N8)
- God alone currently possesses immortality (athanasia) as an inherent attribute (1 Tim 6:16). (E29, N5)
- Mortals must "put on" immortality at the resurrection; they do not currently possess it. (E31, E32, N6)
- The present human body is mortal (thnetos); it is raised incorruptible and immortal at the resurrection. (E31-E33, E55, N10)
- The first man Adam was a living soul (psyche) — earthy, natural; the resurrection body is spiritual (pneumatikos). (E34-E36, N10)
- Death is described as sleep across multiple authors, testaments, and genres, and Jesus himself uses this description. (N9, E47, E20, E23)
- The dead have no thoughts, no knowledge, no praise, and no participation in earthly affairs (the consistent testimony of Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Job, and Isaiah). (E13-E22, E17)
- Humans must seek immortality because they do not currently possess it. (E30, N12)
- The ruach/spirit belongs to God; he gives it and withdraws it; when he withdraws it, all flesh perishes. (E44, E45, E46, N11)
- God "formeth the spirit of man within him" — the spirit is created, not pre-existent or self-sustaining. (E44)

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**

- The Bible explicitly states that humans have an inherently immortal soul. (No such statement exists; 1 Tim 6:16 explicitly denies it for any creature; I15 is I-D)
- The Bible states that the soul cannot die. (Multiple passages explicitly state that the soul dies — Ezk 18:4; Rev 16:3; the soul can be destroyed by God — Mat 10:28)
- The soul and nephesh are different from the spirit and ruach in ways that make the soul immortal and the spirit mortal (or vice versa). (Both terms apply to animals; both terms are mortal in the OT framework)
- Ecclesiastes's statements about the dead (especially 9:5) are restricted to earthly perspective and do not apply to the spirit in God's presence. (The "under the sun" qualifier applies in v.6 but not in v.5; independent passages in Psalms and Isaiah make the same statement without any such qualifier — I8 resolves moderately against this restriction)
- Trichotomy (three ontologically distinct substances: spirit, soul, body) is the biblical teaching on human constitution. (No verse states this; the creation formula has two components; I9 resolves moderately against trichotomy)
- The dead in the intermediate state are consciously aware of earthly events. (Job 14:21 explicitly states the opposite: "He knoweth it not")
- The sleep metaphor is merely metaphorical and does not imply unconsciousness. (The consistent use of "sleep" across all biblical authors, combined with Ecc 9:5's explicit statement, establishes the connection between sleep and unawareness — I12 is I-A)
- The Bible explicitly describes a conscious intermediate state between death and resurrection. (Phil 1:23 and 2 Cor 5:8 are the strongest evidence for it, but neither explicitly describes the mechanism; I7 remains Unresolved)
- "Spirit returns to God" in Ecc 12:7 necessarily means a conscious personal entity goes to God. (The same ruach is shared with animals; thoughts perish simultaneously with ruach departure; I11 resolves moderately against the conscious-entity reading)
- The natural body is not the soul-body but is separate from the soul. (1 Cor 15:44 calls it "psychikos soma" — the soul-body; the body and the soul are not separate in the present state — they constitute the living person together)
