# Word Studies

## Question
What does Scripture explicitly say about the nature and composition of human beings (biblical anthropology)? Focus on nephesh (soul), ruach (spirit), neshamah (breath), the creation of man, whether humans ARE souls or HAVE souls, and what happens at death.

## nephesh -- H5315 (נֶפֶשׁ)
**Original:** nephesh
**Transliteration:** neh-fesh
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 780 in KJV (753 BLB)

### Definition
"Properly, a breathing creature, i.e. animal of (abstractly) vitality; used very widely in a literal, accommodated or figurative sense (bodily or mental)."

### Translations
The extraordinary breadth of translation (214 unique renderings) demonstrates this is NOT a technical term with a single meaning:
- **"soul"** (various forms): ~195 occurrences (~25%)
- **"life"** (various forms): ~95 occurrences (~12%)
- **"creature"**: 9 occurrences
- **"person/persons"**: ~15 occurrences
- **"body"**: 4 occurrences
- **"dead/the dead"**: ~6 occurrences (nephesh = dead body: Lev 21:11; Num 6:6)
- **"heart/mind"**: ~20 occurrences
- **"desire/appetite/lust"**: ~10 occurrences
- **"beast"**: 2 occurrences
- **"self" (himself, herself, themselves, etc.)**: ~15 occurrences

### Key Observations
1. Nephesh is applied to ANIMALS (Gen 1:20,21,24,30; 2:19; 9:10,12,15,16) -- same word for human and animal "souls"
2. Nephesh is used for DEAD BODIES (Lev 21:11; Num 6:6; 19:11,13) -- "soul" = corpse
3. Nephesh can DIE (Ezek 18:4,20; Num 35:11,15,30; Josh 10:28,30,32,35,37,39; 11:11)
4. Man BECAME a living nephesh (Gen 2:7) -- not "received" a nephesh
5. Nephesh is used for appetite/desire (Deut 12:15,20,21; Prov 23:2) -- physical longing
6. Blood IS the nephesh (Lev 17:11,14; Deut 12:23) -- "the life [nephesh] of the flesh is in the blood"

### LXX Connections
- nephesh -> psyche (G5590): 599 occurrences (~80%) -- overwhelmingly dominant mapping
- nephesh -> zao "to live" (G2198): 51 occurrences
- nephesh -> zoe "life" (G2222): 22 occurrences
- nephesh -> thanatos "death" (G2288): 25 occurrences (when nephesh refers to dead body)

### Key Verses
- Gen 2:7: "man became a living soul [nephesh chayyah]"
- Gen 1:20,21,24: nephesh chayyah applied to animals
- Lev 17:11: "the life [nephesh] of the flesh is in the blood"

2. Ruach is applied to ANIMALS (Gen 6:17; 7:15,22; Ecc 3:19,21) -- animals have ruach
3. Ruach is what RETURNS to God at death (Ecc 12:7) -- not a conscious entity but the animating life-principle
4. Ruach DEPARTS at death (Ps 146:4) and thoughts perish "in that very day"
5. Gen 2:7 uses neshamah (NOT ruach) for what God breathed; Ecc 12:7 uses ruach for what returns
6. When God takes away ruach, creatures die and return to dust (Ps 104:29; Job 34:14-15)
7. Ruach is described as given by God to all (Isa 42:5; Zec 12:1; Num 16:22; 27:16)

### LXX Connections
- ruach -> pneuma (G4151): 235 occurrences -- dominant (spirit)
- ruach -> anemos (G417): 44 occurrences (literal wind)
- ruach -> pnoe (G4157): 10 occurrences (breath)

## neshamah -- H5397 (נְשָׁמָה)
**Original:** neshamah
**Transliteration:** nesh-aw-maw
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**Occurrences:** 25 in KJV (24 BLB)

### Definition
"A puff, i.e. wind, angry or vital breath, divine inspiration, intellect. or (concretely) an animal: blast, (that) breath(-eth), inspiration, soul, spirit."

### Translations
- **"breath/the breath"**: 7 occurrences (28%)

- **"blast/at the blast"**: 3 occurrences (12%)
- **"spirit"**: 1 occurrence (4%)
- **"inspiration"**: 1 occurrence (4%)
- **"souls"**: 1 occurrence (4%)

### Key Observations
1. Neshamah is specifically what God breathed into man in Gen 2:7 -- the "breath of life"
2. Much rarer than ruach (25 vs 434 occurrences) -- more specialized term
3. Used alongside ruach in Job 27:3; 34:14 -- suggesting overlap but not identity
4. Gen 7:22 uses BOTH terms: "the breath [neshamah] of life [ruach]" -- neshamah of the ruach of life
5. Applied to divine action: God's breath destroys (2 Sam 22:16; Job 4:9) and creates (Gen 2:7; Job 33:4)
6. Prov 20:27: "The spirit [neshamah] of man is the candle of the LORD"
7. Job 32:8: "the inspiration [neshamah] of the Almighty giveth them understanding"

### LXX Connections
- neshamah -> pnoe (G4157): 14 occurrences -- primary mapping (distinct from ruach -> pneuma)
- neshamah -> pneuma (G4151): 10 occurrences
- neshamah -> zoe (G2222): 3 occurrences

**Key finding**: LXX translators distinguished neshamah (-> pnoe) from ruach (-> pneuma), suggesting they recognized a semantic difference.

### Key Verses
- Gen 2:7: "breathed into his nostrils the breath [neshamah] of life"
- Gen 7:22: "all in whose nostrils [was] the breath [neshamah] of life"

"A primitive root; to puff, in various applications (literally, to inflate, blow hard, scatter, kindle, expire; figuratively, to disesteem): blow, breath, give up, cause to lose (life), seething, snuff."

### Key Observations
1. This is the verb in Gen 2:7 -- God "breathed" (naphach) into man's nostrils
2. Note definition includes "expire" and "cause to lose (life)" -- the same root for breathing IN also means breathing OUT/dying
3. Used in Ezek 37:9 -- God commands: "breathe [naphach] upon these slain, that they may live"
