## Overview

The key biblical vocabulary for human constitution spans two testaments. The major Hebrew terms are nephesh (H5315), ruach (H7307), neshamah (H5397), tselem (H6754), and demuth (H1823). The key Greek terms are psyche (G5590), pneuma (G4151), soma (G4983), athanasia (G110), aphtharsia (G861), and thnetos (G2349). Understanding how these words are actually used across Scripture (not just in the doctrine-proof-text passages) is essential for accurate interpretation.

### H5315 — נֶפֶשׁ (nephesh) — "Soul / Life / Person"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- Transliteration: nephesh (neh-fesh)
- BLB Count: 753 occurrences

**Translation distribution (780 DB occurrences):**

| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| my soul | 95 | 12.2% |
| soul | 43 | 5.5% |
| thy soul | 42 | 5.4% |
| his soul | 36 | 4.6% |
| the souls | 27 | 3.5% |

| his life | 16 | 2.1% |
| creature | 9 | 1.2% |
| person | 8 | 1.0% |
| the persons | 8 | 1.0% |
| [+214 other unique translations] | — | — |

**Key observations from translation distribution:**
1. "Soul" variants dominate (approx. 55% combined) — but "life" variants account for about 12% more
2. "Creature" (9x), "person" (8x), "the persons" (8x) show nephesh used for whole living beings, not just an immaterial part
3. The KJV translates nephesh as "dead body" (Lev 21:11: "nephesh met"), "dead" (Num 6:6), showing it can describe a corpse
4. With 214+ unique translations, nephesh is one of the most semantically flexible words in Hebrew

**Key verses with Hebrew analysis:**

**Gen 1:20** — nephesh chayyah (H5315 + H2416 chay): "living creature/soul" applied to fish and sea creatures
**Gen 1:21** — nephesh chayyah applied to sea creatures and birds
**Gen 1:24** — nephesh chayyah applied to land animals (cattle, creeping things, beasts)
**Gen 2:7** — "man BECAME a living nephesh" — formula: dust + neshamah → nephesh chayyah. The man does not RECEIVE a soul; he BECOMES one. The verb is hayah (became), not nathal/laqach (receive/take).
**Gen 2:19** — animals are nephesh chayyah (same construction as Gen 2:7 human)
**Gen 35:18** — "as her nephesh was in departing" = as she died. Soul-departure = death
**Lev 21:11** — "nephesh met" (dead soul) = corpse. A nephesh can be dead.
**Num 6:6** — "nephesh met" again = dead body
**Ezk 18:4,20** — "the nephesh that sins, it shall die" — nephesh is explicitly mortal

**Theological summary:** Nephesh in Hebrew does not primarily mean an immaterial immortal soul. It means the whole living creature — the vitality, person, self, appetite, desire of a living being. It applies equally to animals and humans. It can die (Ezk 18:4), it can be a corpse (Lev 21:11), and it designates the whole person rather than a separable soul-substance.

### H7307 — רוּחַ (ruach) — "Spirit / Wind / Breath"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- Transliteration: ruach (roo-akh)
- BLB Count: 378 occurrences
- Definition: "wind; by resemblance breath, i.e. a sensible (or even violent) exhalation; figuratively, life, anger, unsubstantiality; by extension, a region of the sky; by resemblance spirit, but only of a rational being (including its expression and functions): air, anger, blast, breath, cool, courage, mind, quarter, side, spirit(-ual), tempest, vain, (whirl-)wind(-y)."

**Translation distribution (434 DB occurrences):**

| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| the spirit | 53 | 12.2% |
| spirit | 39 | 9.0% |
| wind | 30 | 6.9% |
| the wind | 26 | 6.0% |
| the Spirit | 22 | 5.1% |
| my spirit | 20 | 4.6% |
| breath | 8 | 1.8% |
| [+126 other unique translations] | — | — |

**Key verses:**

**Gen 6:17; 7:15** — ruach chayyim (spirit of lives) in all flesh, animals and humans
**Ecc 3:19** — man and beast share "one breath" (ruach echad) — same ruach
**Ecc 3:21** — ruach of man goes upward; ruach of beast goes down — but presented as a question, not a certainty
**Ecc 12:7** — ruach returns to God who gave it. God is the original owner/source; the ruach returns to him at death
**Psa 146:4** — "His ruach goes forth, he returns to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish." Ruach departure = death = immediate cessation of thought
**Psa 104:29-30** — God takes away ruach → death; God sends forth ruach → creation
**Job 27:3** — "spirit of God" (ruach + El) is in man's nostrils = it is God's own ruach animating man
**Job 34:14** — If God gathers his ruach and neshamah back, all flesh perishes
**Zec 12:1** — God "formeth" (yatsar) the ruach of man within him — it is created by God, not pre-existing

**Theological summary:** Ruach is primarily the breath/wind/spirit that God gives to animate living creatures. It belongs to God and returns to him at death (Ecc 12:7). It is not described as having ongoing personal consciousness after death. Like nephesh, it applies to animals as well as humans (Gen 6:17; 7:15; Ecc 3:19). The ruach is God's animating presence in creation, not an independent immortal soul-substance.

### H5397 — נְשָׁמָה (neshamah) — "Breath / Inspiration"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- BLB Count: 24 occurrences
- Definition: "a puff, i.e. wind, angry or vital breath, divine inspiration, intellect, or (concretely) an animal: blast, (that) breath(-eth), inspiration, soul, spirit."

**Translation distribution (25 occurrences):**

| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| breath | 4 | 16.0% |
| the breath | 3 | 12.0% |
| that breathed / to breathe | 2 | 8.0% |
| at the blast | 2 | 8.0% |
| [various other 1x translations] | — | — |

**Key verses:**

**Gen 2:7** — neshamah chayyim breathed by God into Adam's nostrils → man becomes nephesh chayyah
**Gen 7:22** — "all in whose nostrils was the neshamah ruach chayyim" — neshamah and ruach combined = breath of life in ALL creatures
**Job 27:3** — neshamah = man's breath; ruach = spirit of God in his nostrils
**Job 32:8** — "the neshamah of the Almighty giveth them understanding" — neshamah = divine inspiration/intellect
**Job 34:14** — God gathers ruach and neshamah together → death
**Prov 20:27** — "the neshamah of man is the candle of the LORD" — God's light for moral self-examination
**Isa 2:22** — "cease from man, whose neshamah is in his nostrils" — breath as the fragile, God-dependent vital force

**Theological summary:** Neshamah is the divine breath-spark that God breathed into Adam (Gen 2:7). It provides intellect and moral awareness (Job 32:8; Prov 20:27). It is God's own breath — the "candle of the LORD" — not a self-sustaining entity. In Gen 7:22 it is combined with ruach and applied to all creatures that breathe. It does not appear to be an immortal soul that survives death separately.

### H6754 — צֶלֶם (tselem) — "Image / Likeness / Idol"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: masculine noun
- BLB Count: 17 occurrences
- Definition: "from an unused root meaning to shade; a phantom, i.e. (figuratively) illusion, resemblance; hence, a representative figure, especially an idol: image, vain shew."

**Translation distribution (18 occurrences):**

| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| images | 3 | 16.7% |
| the images | 3 | 16.7% |
| in the image | 2 | 11.1% |
| in our image | 1 | — |
| [various 1x] | — | — |

**Key verses — applied to humans (creation):**
- Gen 1:26 — "Let us make man in our tselem, after our demuth"
- Gen 1:27 — "God created man in his tselem; in the tselem of God created he him"
- Gen 5:3 — "Adam begat [Seth] in his own likeness, after his tselem"
- Gen 9:6 — "for in the tselem of God made he man"

**Key verses — applied to idols/images:**
- Num 33:52 — idols (tselem) to be destroyed
- 1 Sam 6:5 — golden images (tselem) of mice and emerods
- 2 Kgs 11:18 — images (tselem) broken in pieces
- Psa 39:6 — man walks "in a vain shew" (tselem)
- Ezk 7:20; 16:17; 23:14 — idols

**Theological summary:** Tselem appears 17 times. It is applied to humans only in the Genesis creation accounts and in passages quoting them (Gen 1:26,27; 5:3; 9:6). It is NEVER applied to animals. Its other uses are for physical idols and images. The "image of God" in man is therefore a uniquely human attribute that distinguishes man from the animal kingdom.

### H1823 — דְּמוּת (demuth) — "Likeness / Similitude"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: adverb, feminine noun
- BLB Count: 25 occurrences
- Definition: "resemblance; concretely, model, shape; adverbially, like: fashion, like(-ness, as), manner, similitude."

**Key occurrences relevant to human image:**
- Gen 1:26 — "after our demuth" (used with tselem)
- Gen 5:1 — "in the demuth of God made he him"
- Gen 5:3 — Adam begat Seth "in his own demuth"

**Note:** Demuth qualifies tselem — it adds "resemblance/likeness" to the "representative image." The two terms together emphasize that man is a functional representative (tselem) who resembles (demuth) God.

---

### H6083 — עָפָר (aphar) — "Dust / Earth"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: masculine noun
- BLB Count: 110 occurrences
- Definition: "dust (as powdered or gray); hence, clay, earth, mud: ashes, dust, earth, ground, morter, powder, rubbish."

**Key occurrences:**
- Gen 2:7 — "dust of the ground" (aphar min-ha-adamah) — man formed from dust
- Gen 3:19 — "for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return"
- Job 34:15 — "man shall turn again unto dust"
- Ecc 3:20 — "all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again" — man AND beast
- Dan 12:2 — "sleep in the dust of the earth"
- Psa 104:29 — "return to their dust"

**Note:** Aphar (dust) is the material component of human constitution. At death, the body returns to dust (reversal of creation). This applies equally to animals (Ecc 3:20). Dust by itself is inert — it requires neshamah/ruach to become a living nephesh.

---

### H120 — אָדָם (adam) vs. H582 — אֱנוֹשׁ (enosh)

**H120 (adam):**
- BLB Count: 552 occurrences
- Definition: "ruddy i.e. a human being (an individual or the species, mankind, etc.): another, hypocrite, common sort, low, man (mean, of low degree), person."
- Used generically (mankind) and as the proper name Adam
- Related to H127 adamah (ground/soil) — "the earthy one"

**H582 (enosh):**
- BLB Count: 564 occurrences
- Definition: "properly, a mortal (and thus differing from the more dignified 120/adam); hence, a man in general: another, (blood-)thirsty, certain, chap(-man); divers, fellow, in the flower of their age, husband, (certain, mortal) man, people, person, servant, some (of them), stranger, those, their trade."
- Connotes frailty/mortality more strongly than adam

**Theological note:** Both words are used in Psalm 8:4 ("What is man/enosh that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man/adam that thou visitest him?"). The Psalm stresses human frailty and smallness before God. The pairing of enosh (mortal/frail) and adam (earthy one) reinforces the biblical perspective on human weakness and contingency.

### G5590 — ψυχή (psyche) — "Soul / Life"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- Transliteration: psyche (psoo-khay)
- BLB Count: 105 occurrences
- Definition: "breath, i.e. (by implication) spirit, abstractly or concretely"

**Translation distribution (87 KJV occurrences):**

| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| soul | 32 | 36.8% |
| life | 25 | 28.7% |
| souls | 18 | 20.7% |
| lives | 4 | 4.6% |
| their minds | 1 | — |
| the heart | 1 | — |
| [other] | 6 | — |

**Key observations:**
1. "Soul" and "life" together = 65.5% of occurrences — these are interchangeable in many contexts
2. G5590 is the LXX translation of H5315 (nephesh) — same semantic range
3. Mat 10:28: God can DESTROY (G622 apollumi) both psyche and soma — psyche is not indestructible
4. Rev 16:3: "every living psyche died in the sea" — sea creatures' souls/lives died
5. 1Co 15:45: First Adam became a "living psyche" (quoting LXX of Gen 2:7) — psyche = the whole living person, not a spiritual component
6. Jhn 12:25: "he that loveth his psyche shall lose it; and he that hateth his psyche in this world shall keep it unto life eternal" — psyche = mortal earthly life

**Relationship to Hebrew:** G5590 (psyche) in LXX translates H5315 (nephesh) overwhelmingly. The semantic range is nearly identical: living being, life, person, desire.

### G4151 — πνεῦμα (pneuma) — "Spirit / Wind / Breath"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: neuter noun
- Transliteration: pneuma (pnyoo-mah)
- BLB Count: 385 occurrences
- Definition: "a current of air, i.e. breath (blast) or a breeze; by analogy or figuratively, a spirit..."

**Translation distribution (342 occurrences):**

| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| Ghost [Holy Ghost] | 85 | 24.9% |
| Spirit | 80 | 23.4% |
| spirit | 71 | 20.8% |
| the Spirit | 24 | 7.0% |
| spirits | 22 | 6.4% |
| the spirit | 12 | 3.5% |
| [other] | — | — |

**Key verses for human pneuma:**
- Luk 23:46 — "Father, into thy hands I commend my pneuma" — Jesus at death
- Acts 7:59 — Stephen: "Lord Jesus, receive my pneuma" — human spirit at death
- Jas 2:26 — "the body without the pneuma is dead"
- 1Th 5:23 — "spirit (pneuma) and soul (psyche) and body (soma)"
- Heb 4:12 — word divides pneuma and psyche asunder
- Heb 12:23 — "spirits of just men made perfect" (pneuma)
- 1Co 15:45 — last Adam = "quickening pneuma" (life-giving spirit)

**Relationship to Hebrew:** G4151 (pneuma) translates H7307 (ruach) in LXX. The LXX uses pneuma for ruach in Gen 1:2 (Spirit of God), Gen 6:17 (breath of life), and Ecc 12:7 (spirit returns to God). The semantic range parallels ruach: wind, breath, spirit.

### G4983 — σῶμα (soma) — "Body"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: neuter noun
- Transliteration: soma (so-mah)
- BLB Count: 146 occurrences
- Definition: "the body (as a sound whole), used in a very wide application, literally or figuratively."

**Translation distribution (132 occurrences):**

| Translation | Count | % |
|-------------|-------|---|
| body | 108 | 81.8% |
| bodies | 9 | 6.8% |
| the body | 6 | 4.5% |
| [other] | — | — |

**Key verses:**
- Mat 10:28 — body can be killed (by men); both body and soul can be destroyed (by God)
- 1Co 15:44 — "psychikos soma" (natural/soul body) sown; "pneumatikos soma" (spiritual body) raised
- 2Co 5:1 — body as earthly house / tabernacle
- Jas 2:26 — body without spirit is dead
- 1Th 5:23 — soma as one of the three aspects of the whole person
- Php 3:21 — "vile body" to be changed at resurrection

---

### G110 — ἀθανασία (athanasia) — "Immortality"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- Transliteration: athanasia (ath-an-as-ee-ah)
- BLB Count: 3 occurrences
- Definition: "undying-ness; immortality"

**All 3 occurrences:**
1. **1 Corinthians 15:53** — "this mortal must put on athanasia" — mortals acquire it at resurrection
2. **1 Corinthians 15:54** — "when this mortal shall have put on athanasia" — future event
3. **1 Timothy 6:16** — "who ONLY (monos) hath athanasia" — God alone has it

**Critical analysis:**
- The word appears only 3 times in the entire NT
- In 1Ti 6:16, God is described as the ONLY one having immortality (monos = alone, uniquely). This is the strongest single statement on immortality in the NT.
- In 1Co 15:53-54, mortals "put on" immortality at the resurrection — it is received at a future event, not a present possession
- These two passages together make a powerful case against inherent human immortality: (1) only God has it; (2) mortals must put it on at the resurrection

---

### G861 — ἀφθαρσία (aphtharsia) — "Incorruption / Immortality"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- BLB Count: 8 occurrences
- Definition: "incorruptibility; genitive, unending existence; immortality (figuratively), genuineness: immortality, incorruption, sincerity."

**All occurrences:**
- Rom 2:7 — men "seek" aphtharsia — it is a future goal, not a present possession
- 1Co 15:42 — resurrection body "raised in aphtharsia"
- 1Co 15:50 — "corruption cannot inherit aphtharsia"
- Eph 6:24 — "grace with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in aphtharsia" (sincerity/incorruption)
- 2Ti 1:10 — Christ "brought to light life and aphtharsia through the gospel"

**Note:** Like G110 (athanasia), aphtharsia is something mortals seek (Rom 2:7) and acquire through resurrection (1Co 15:42). It is "brought to light through the gospel" (2Ti 1:10) — it was not universally available before Christ's resurrection.

---

### G2349 — θνητός (thnetos) — "Mortal"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: adjective
- BLB Count: 6 occurrences
- Definition: "liable to die: mortal(-ity)."

**All 6 occurrences:**
- Rom 6:12 — "sin in your mortal body"
- Rom 8:11 — "quicken your mortal bodies"
- 1Co 15:53 — "this mortal must put on immortality"
- 1Co 15:54 — "when this mortal shall have put on immortality"
- 2Co 4:11 — "life of Jesus...made manifest in our mortal flesh"
- 2Co 5:4 — "mortality might be swallowed up of life"

**Note:** Thnetos (mortal/liable to die) is the condition of present human existence. Paul uses it consistently for the present body awaiting resurrection. At the resurrection, thnetos puts on athanasia. This is the NT framework: present mortality → resurrection → immortality.

---

### G1504 — εἰκών (eikon) — "Image"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- BLB Count: 23 occurrences
- Definition: "a likeness, i.e. (literally) statue, profile, or (figuratively) representation, resemblance: image."

**Key occurrences for the image of God:**
- 1Co 11:7 — man is "the image (eikon) and glory of God"
- 1Co 15:49 — "we have borne the image (eikon) of the earthy; we shall also bear the image of the heavenly"
- 2Co 3:18 — "being changed into the same eikon from glory to glory"
- 2Co 4:4 — Christ is "the image (eikon) of God"
- Col 1:15 — Christ is "the image (eikon) of the invisible God"
- Col 3:10 — new man "renewed in knowledge after the eikon of him that created him"
- Heb 10:1 — law has only a "shadow" (not the eikon) of good things

**LXX connection:** G1504 eikon translates H6754 tselem in Gen 1:26,27 (LXX). The NT continues using eikon for the human/divine relationship, with Christ as the perfect image of God.

---

### G5591 — ψυχικός (psychikos) — "Natural / Animate / Soul-body"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: adjective
- BLB Count: 6 occurrences
- Definition: "sensitive, i.e. animate (in distinction on the one hand from pneumatikos, which is the higher or renovated nature; and on the other from the bestial nature): natural, sensual."

**Key occurrences:**
- 1Co 2:14 — "the natural (psychikos) man receiveth not the things of the Spirit"
- 1Co 15:44 — "It is sown a natural (psychikos) body; it is raised a spiritual (pneumatikos) body"
- 1Co 15:46 — "that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural (psychikos)"
- Jas 3:15 — "this wisdom...is earthly, sensual (psychikos), devilish"
- Jude 19 — "sensual (psychikos)...having not the Spirit"

**Theological note:** Paul's contrast in 1Co 15:44-46 is crucial. The present body is a "psychikos soma" (soul-body / natural body — literally, a body animated by psyche, i.e., by the Gen 2:7 breath of life). The resurrection body is a "pneumatikos soma" (spirit-body — animated by the life-giving Spirit). This is the Adam-Christ contrast: first Adam → psyche (living soul); last Adam → pneuma (life-giving spirit). The transformation at resurrection is from one mode of life-animation to another.

---

### G5517 — χοϊκός (choikos) — "Earthy / Dusty"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: adjective
- BLB Count: 4 occurrences
- Definition: "dusty or dirty (soil-like), i.e. (by implication) terrene: earthy."

**All occurrences (1Co 15:47-49):**
- 1Co 15:47 — "The first man is of the earth, earthy (choikos)"
- 1Co 15:48 — "As is the earthy (choikos), such are they also that are earthy (choikos)"
- 1Co 15:49 — "as we have borne the image of the earthy (choikos)"

**Note:** Choikos (dusty/earthy) directly alludes to Gen 2:7 (aphar = dust). Paul's Adam-terminology in 1Co 15 is built on the Gen 2:7 creation account. The first Adam is "earthy" because he was formed from aphar (dust). The resurrection body transcends this earthy nature.

---

### G4152 — πνευματικός (pneumatikos) — "Spiritual"

**Lexicon:**
- Part of Speech: adjective
- BLB Count: 26 occurrences
- Definition: "non-carnal, i.e. (humanly) ethereal (as opposed to gross), or (daemoniacally) a spirit (concretely), or (divinely) supernatural, regenerate, religious: spiritual. Compare psychikos."

**Key occurrences for this study:**
- 1Co 15:44 — the resurrection body is "pneumatikos"
- 1Co 15:46 — the pneumatikos order comes AFTER (not before) the psychikos: "that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural"

**Critical note:** Paul explicitly states that the spiritual/pneumatikos comes AFTER the natural/psychikos (v.46). This directly refutes the Platonic notion that man first possesses a pre-existent spiritual soul that then descends into a body. In Paul's Adam-Christ typology, the earthy comes first; the heavenly transformation comes through resurrection.

## Hebrew Morphological Analysis — Key Parsing Notes

*(From hebrew_parser.py analysis — see raw-data/hebrew-parsing.md for full output)*

### Genesis 2:7 — Critical parsing

The verb "became" (wayehi) in "man became a living soul":
- Root: H1961 hayah (to be/become)
- Form: Qal Wayyiqtol 3rd person masculine singular
- The preposition ל (le) before nephesh is critical: it indicates RESULT, not source
- Man did not RECEIVE a nephesh; he BECAME a nephesh
- The formula: dust + neshamah → nephesh (result = whole living being)

### Ezekiel 18:4 — "The soul that sins shall die"

- Subject: nephesh (H5315 feminine noun)
- Verb: תָּמוּת (tamut) — Qal imperfect 3fs — "it shall die"
- The nephesh is the explicit grammatical subject of dying

### Ecclesiastes 12:7 — Two-part parallel

- "The dust returns (tashuv) to the earth" — ruach returns (tashuv) to God
- Same verb (shub, H7725 = return, go back) for both — symmetric reversal of Gen 2:7
- Ruach "returns" because it came FROM God originally (Job 27:3: "the spirit of God is in my nostrils")

### Psalm 146:4 — Thoughts perish that very day

- "His thoughts perish" — אָבְדוּ עֶשְׁתֹּנֹתָיו (avdu eshtonotav)
- "Perish" (abad, H6) = destruction/vanishing; "that very day" = same day ruach departs
- No delay; consciousness ceases with the cessation of ruach
