# What Is Man? -- Biblical Anthropology and Human Constitution
## A Plain-English Summary of the Biblical Evidence

---

## Introduction

What does the Bible actually say about human nature? Does a person have an immortal soul that survives death? Is the spirit a conscious entity that lives on after the body dies? Or does Scripture tell a different story?

This study examined every relevant biblical passage on human nature -- what humanity is made of, what happens at death, and what Scripture says about immortality. What follows is a summary of what the Bible plainly says, what it does not say, and how that evidence weighs out.

## What Scripture Says About How Humans Were Made

The foundational text is Genesis 2:7:

> "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."

Three things are worth noting here. First, the Hebrew says man *became* a living soul -- he did not receive a soul as a separate component added to his body. Man is a living soul, not a body that contains one. Second, the same phrase ("living soul") is used for animals in Genesis 1:20-21 and 1:24 -- so "soul" is not a uniquely human property that sets people apart from animals. Third, what does distinguish humans from animals is that humans are made in the image of God (Gen 1:26-27; 9:6).

Several other passages confirm that the breath and spirit in humans are given by God, not inherent properties they possess on their own:

> "God giveth to all life, and breath, and all things." (Acts 17:25)

> "The Spirit of God hath made me; and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life." (Job 33:4)

## What Scripture Says About Death

Death, according to Scripture, reverses the creation of Genesis 2:7. What was joined together at creation comes apart:

> "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." (Ecc 12:7)

> "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish." (Ps 146:4)

That last phrase -- "in that very day his thoughts perish" -- is striking. Scripture does not merely say the body dies while the mind lives on. It says thoughts cease when breath ceases.

This is consistent with a large body of passages describing death as a state of complete unawareness:

- "The dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; and the memory of them is forgotten." (Ecc 9:5)
- "Their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished." (Ecc 9:6)
- "There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave." (Ecc 9:10)
- "In death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?" (Ps 6:5)
- "The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence." (Ps 115:17)
- "The grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee." (Isa 38:18-19)
- "Shall the dead arise and praise thee? Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?" (Ps 88:10-11)

Seven or more biblical authors -- from Moses to Paul -- describe death as a sleep: Deut 31:16; Job 14:12; Dan 12:2; John 11:11; Acts 7:60; 1 Cor 15:51; 1 Thess 4:14. Jesus himself calls the dead Lazarus "asleep" (John 11:11).

Job 14:21 captures the picture vividly: a dead man's sons may rise to honor or fall to shame, "and he knoweth it not."

## What Scripture Says About the Soul

The Hebrew word for "soul" (*nephesh*) carries a wide range of meanings -- it can refer to a living creature, a person, one's appetite or desire, or even a dead body. In Leviticus 21:11 and Numbers 6:6, the phrase *nephesh meth* means "dead soul" or "dead body." The soul is not, in Hebrew thinking, inherently alive or immortal.

More directly:

> "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." (Ezek 18:4, 20)

> "Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." (Matt 10:28)

Scripture plainly states that the soul can die and can be destroyed. Neither the Old nor New Testament describes the soul as inherently indestructible.

## What Scripture Says About Immortality

This may be the most important finding. The Bible does not teach that humans naturally possess immortality. Instead:

> "God only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto." (1 Tim 6:16)

Immortality belongs to God alone. It is not a property humans are born with. For human beings, immortality is something to be received, not something already owned:

- "To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for... immortality, [God will render] eternal life." (Rom 2:7)
- "This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality." (1 Cor 15:53)
- "[Christ] hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel." (2 Tim 1:10)

The resurrection passages make clear that immortality is something mortals put on at resurrection -- they do not already have it. Genesis 3:22-24 confirms this: God barred Adam and Eve from the tree of life specifically to prevent them from "living for ever" in their fallen state. Immortality was a conditional gift, not a built-in property.

## The Two Contested Passages

Two New Testament passages are commonly read as evidence for a conscious existence between death and resurrection. Examining them carefully reveals a different picture.

**2 Corinthians 5:8 and Philippians 1:23**

Paul writes of being "absent from the body, and present with the Lord" (2 Cor 5:8), and says he has "a desire to depart, and to be with Christ" (Phil 1:23). These are often cited to prove that at death, believers immediately enter conscious fellowship with Christ.

However, Paul himself explains in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 that being with the Lord follows resurrection: "the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord." Being with the Lord is tied to resurrection, not to the moment of death.

It is also notable that in 2 Corinthians 5:4, Paul says he does *not* want to be "unclothed" (that is, disembodied) -- his desire is to be "clothed upon" with his resurrection body. His longing is for the resurrection, not for a disembodied interim.

The best reading of "to depart and be with Christ" is that from the perspective of the one who sleeps in death, there is no experienced gap -- departure and resurrection-reunion feel immediate, just as a dreamless sleep feels instant.

**Luke 23:43 -- "Today Thou Shalt Be With Me in Paradise"**

The Greek manuscripts have no punctuation. The traditional reading places a comma before "today": "I say unto thee, today thou shalt be with me in paradise." But another reading places "today" with "I say": "I say unto thee today, thou shalt be with me in paradise" -- meaning the promise is made on this day, with fulfillment at the resurrection.

The second reading is consistent with John 20:17, where on resurrection Sunday Jesus says, "I am not yet ascended to my Father." If Jesus had not ascended by Sunday morning, he was not in paradise on Friday. The punctuation that creates the conflict depends entirely on an editorial comma added by translators, not on anything in the original text.

## What the Bible Does NOT Say

Several common beliefs about the afterlife turn out not to be taught by Scripture -- at least not in the way they are often assumed:

- **Scripture never says humans have an "immortal soul."** The phrase does not appear in the Bible. What Scripture says is that God alone has immortality, and that humans must receive it at resurrection.

- **Scripture never says the spirit carries consciousness after death.** Psalm 146:4 says thoughts perish when breath departs. The spirit that returns to God is not described as thinking or feeling.

- **Scripture never teaches a conscious intermediate state between death and resurrection as a doctrine.** The passages cited for this are expressions of hope and preference, not descriptions of the afterlife.

- **Scripture does not define a fixed number of human "parts."** First Thessalonians 5:23 mentions spirit, soul, and body; Mark 12:30 mentions heart, soul, mind, and strength; Luke 1:46-47 uses soul and spirit as synonyms. The terms are used flexibly, not as a precise anatomy.

- **Scripture does not limit the Ecclesiastes death passages to an "earthly" perspective that excludes their plain meaning.** No verse makes this qualification. Psalm 146:4, Psalm 6:5, and other passages outside Ecclesiastes say the same thing.

## Conclusion

The biblical picture of human nature, taken as a whole, is consistent. Man was formed from dust, given breath by God, and became a living being. At death, that process reverses: the breath returns to God, the body returns to dust, and thought ceases. The dead are, in the language of every biblical author who addresses it, asleep.

Immortality is not something human beings possess by nature. It belongs to God alone, and is given to human beings at resurrection through Jesus Christ.

The annihilationist (conditionalist) reading -- that the dead are unconscious, that the soul is mortal, and that eternal life is a resurrection gift rather than a natural human property -- is what Scripture explicitly states. The eternal torment view's key supporting claim, that humans possess an inherently immortal, indestructible soul, is not stated anywhere in Scripture. It requires redefining the plain meaning of "die" (Ezek 18:4), "destroy" (Matt 10:28), and "only" (1 Tim 6:16).

What distinguishes human beings from animals is not the possession of a soul -- animals have that too -- but the image of God (Gen 1:26-27). What gives human beings hope beyond death is not an immortal soul but the resurrection promised in the gospel: "this mortal must put on immortality" (1 Cor 15:53).
