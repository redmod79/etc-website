## Focus Area 1: The Creation Formula (Gen 2:7)

### Genesis 1:20-30 — Nephesh applied to animals

Genesis 1:20	And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
Genesis 1:21	And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
Genesis 1:22	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
Genesis 1:23	And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
Genesis 1:24	And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
Genesis 1:25	And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.
Genesis 1:26	And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
Genesis 1:27	So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
Genesis 1:28	And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
Genesis 1:29	And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
Genesis 1:30	And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life, [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so.

**Note (v.20):** "moving creature that hath life" = H5315 nephesh chayyah. (v.21) "every living creature" = nephesh chayyah. (v.24) "living creature" = nephesh chayyah. Animals share the same Hebrew term as humans in Gen 2:7.

### Genesis 2:1-25 — Creation of man (dust + breath = living soul)

Genesis 2:1	Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
Genesis 2:2	And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
Genesis 2:3	And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
Genesis 2:4	These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
Genesis 2:5	And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground.
Genesis 2:6	But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
Genesis 2:7	And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
Genesis 2:8	And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Genesis 2:9	And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis 2:15	And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
Genesis 2:16	And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
Genesis 2:17	But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
Genesis 2:19	And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof.

**Key verse (v.7):** Dust + breath of life (H5397 neshamah) → man BECAME a living soul (H5315 nephesh chayyah). The formula is: two elements combine; the result is the whole living person. See Hebrew parsing for details.

**Note (v.19):** Animals are also called "living creature" (nephesh chayyah) — the same construction as the human in v.7.

### Genesis 3:19-24 — Return to dust; tree of life barred

Genesis 3:19	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou [art], and unto dust shalt thou return.
Genesis 3:22	And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
Genesis 3:23	Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
Genesis 3:24	So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

**Key (v.19):** Dust returns to dust — reversal of Gen 2:7. (v.22-24): Immortality was conditional on access to the tree of life. Without it, man would not "live for ever."

## Focus Area 2: Nephesh/Ruach Applied to Animals

### Genesis 6:17; 7:15, 22 — All creatures share breath of life

Genesis 6:17	And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life, from under heaven; [and] every thing that [is] in the earth shall die.
Genesis 7:15	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life.
Genesis 7:22	All in whose nostrils [was] the breath of life, of all that [was] in the dry [land], died.

**Note:** "Breath of life" in 6:17 and 7:15 = H7307 ruach chayyim. In 7:22 = H5397 neshamah + H7307 ruach. Both ruach and neshamah applied equally to animals and humans.

### Ecclesiastes 3:19-21 — Man and beast share one ruach

Ecclesiastes 3:19	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity.
Ecclesiastes 3:20	All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
Ecclesiastes 3:21	Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

**Key:** "One breath" (H7307 ruach) shared by man and beast (v.19). Both go to one place — dust. V.21 asks whether the spirit of man goes upward (a rhetorical question consistent with not knowing for certain, in the context of life "under the sun").

### Revelation 16:3 — Sea creatures have psyche (soul)

Revelation 16:3	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead [man]: and every living soul died in the sea.

**Key:** "Living soul" = G5590 psyche zosa. Sea creatures are called "living souls" — the same term used for humans. Their souls died = souls are mortal.

---

## Focus Area 3: Image of God (Tselem/Eikon)

### Genesis 1:26-27; 5:3; 9:6 — Tselem in creation context

Genesis 1:26	And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
Genesis 1:27	So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
Genesis 9:6	Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.

**Note:** H6754 tselem (image) + H1823 demuth (likeness) in 1:26. Only humans are explicitly made in God's image. No animal is ever described with tselem in any biblical passage.

## Focus Area 4: Immortality — Inherent or Conditional?

### 1 Timothy 6:14-17 — God alone has immortality

1 Timothy 6:14	That thou keep [this] commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
1 Timothy 6:15	Which in his times he shall shew, [who is] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
1 Timothy 6:16	Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom [be] honour and power everlasting. Amen.

**Key (v.16):** "Who ONLY hath immortality" — G110 athanasia. God alone possesses immortality as an inherent attribute. If God alone has it, humans do not inherently possess it.

### Romans 2:7-11 — Humans must seek immortality

Romans 2:7	To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
Romans 2:8	But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
Romans 2:9	Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile:
Romans 2:10	But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:

**Key (v.7):** Humans "seek" immortality (G861 aphtharsia) — they do not yet possess it. It is a goal to be attained, not a present possession.

### 1 Corinthians 15:51-58 — Mortals "put on" immortality at resurrection

1 Corinthians 15:51	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
1 Corinthians 15:52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
1 Corinthians 15:53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.
1 Corinthians 15:54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
1 Corinthians 15:55	O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory?
1 Corinthians 15:56	The sting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law.
1 Corinthians 15:57	But thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians 15:58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

**Key (v.53):** "This mortal MUST PUT ON immortality" — not: "this immortal soul escapes the mortal body." Immortality is something mortals put on at the resurrection, not something they already possess.

## Focus Area 5: The Soul's Mortality — Can Nephesh/Psyche Die?

### Ezekiel 18:1-32 — The soul that sins shall die

Ezekiel 18:4	Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
Ezekiel 18:20	The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
Ezekiel 18:27	Again, when the wicked [man] turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
Ezekiel 18:31	Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
Ezekiel 18:32	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn [yourselves], and live ye.

**Key (v.4, 20):** H5315 nephesh is the explicit subject of dying. "The soul that sins shall die." Not: the body will die but the soul will live on. The soul itself is what dies. (v.27): "save his soul alive" — the soul can be saved from death, implying it would otherwise die.

### Matthew 10:27-31 — God can destroy soul and body

Matthew 10:27	What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, [that] preach ye upon the housetops.
Matthew 10:28	And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Matthew 10:29	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
Matthew 10:30	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew 10:31	Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.

**Key (v.28):** Men can kill the body but not the soul. God, however, CAN destroy (G622 apollumi — fully destroy) both soul and body. The soul is not indestructible; it is only beyond human reach. God retains authority to destroy it.

### Genesis 35:18 — Nephesh departing at death

Genesis 35:18	And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.

**Key:** Rachel's "soul was departing" as she died. The soul's departure = death. Nephesh is the life-principle, not a separately-surviving entity. The parenthetical "(for she died)" equates soul-departure with death itself.

### Leviticus 21:10-12; Numbers 6:6 — Nephesh = dead body

Leviticus 21:10	And [he that is] the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;
Leviticus 21:11	Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;

Numbers 6:6	All the days that he separateth [himself] unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body.

**Key:** "Dead body" in Lev 21:11 = H5315 nephesh met ("dead soul"). In Num 6:6 = nephesh met likewise. Soul is used for a corpse — the dead body IS called a nephesh. This reinforces that nephesh = the whole living (or dead) person, not a separately surviving soul.

---

## Focus Area 6: State of the Dead — Consciousness or Sleep?

### Psalm 146:1-10 — At death, thoughts perish

Psalm 146:1	Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
Psalm 146:2	While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
Psalm 146:3	Put not your trust in princes, [nor] in the son of man, in whom [there is] no help.
Psalm 146:4	His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Psalm 146:5	Happy [is he] that [hath] the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope [is] in the LORD his God:
Psalm 146:6	Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein [is]: which keepeth truth for ever:

**Key (v.4):** When breath (H7307 ruach) goes forth, man returns to earth "and in that very day his thoughts perish." Not at some later time; not after a period of conscious survival — that very day. Thoughts = plans, consciousness.

### Psalm 6:5; 115:17 — Dead do not praise God

Psalm 6:5	For in death [there is] no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?

Psalm 115:16	The heaven, [even] the heavens, [are] the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
Psalm 115:17	The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.
Psalm 115:18	But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.

**Key:** No remembrance, no praise in death. "Neither any that go down into silence" — death is silence, not continued conscious activity.

### Psalm 88:10-12 — No testimony in death

Psalm 88:10	Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise [and] praise thee? Selah.
Psalm 88:11	Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? [or] thy faithfulness in destruction?
Psalm 88:12	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

**Key:** The grave is "the land of forgetfulness." The dead cannot praise God. The rhetorical questions all expect "no" as the answer.

### Ecclesiastes 9:5-6, 10 — Dead know nothing

Ecclesiastes 9:5	For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
Ecclesiastes 9:6	Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any [thing] that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 9:10	Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do [it] with thy might; for [there is] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.

**Key (v.5):** "The dead know not any thing." (v.10): "No work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave." Consciousness ceases at death.

### Isaiah 38:10-20 — Hezekiah: grave cannot praise God

Isaiah 38:10	I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
Isaiah 38:11	I said, I shall not see the LORD, [even] the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
Isaiah 38:18	For the grave cannot praise thee, death can [not] celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
Isaiah 38:19	The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I [do] this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

**Key (v.18-19):** "The grave cannot praise thee" — the dead do not continue in conscious worship. "The living, the living, he shall praise thee" — praise is the activity of the living, not the dead.

### Daniel 12:1-3 — Death as sleep in dust

Daniel 12:1	And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation [even] to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
Daniel 12:2	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt.
Daniel 12:3	And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.

**Key (v.2):** "Sleep in the DUST of the earth" — death is described as sleeping in the dust (reversal of Gen 2:7 dust + breath). The resurrection is an awakening from this sleep.

### John 11:10-26 — Jesus teaches death as sleep

John 11:10	But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.
John 11:11	These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
John 11:12	Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
John 11:13	Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
John 11:14	Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
John 11:23	Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
John 11:25	Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
John 11:26	And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?

**Key:** Jesus equates "asleep" with "dead" (v.11-14). He did not say "Lazarus is fully conscious in paradise." He called it sleep. The disciples assumed ongoing life if asleep; Jesus corrected them: "he is dead."

### Job 14:10-22 — Man lies down and rises not

Job 14:10	But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where [is] he?
Job 14:11	[As] the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:
Job 14:12	So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens [be] no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
Job 14:13	O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
Job 14:14	If a man die, shall he live [again]? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
Job 14:15	Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
Job 14:20	Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
Job 14:21	His sons come to honour, and he knoweth [it] not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth [it] not of them.
Job 14:22	But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.

**Key (v.12):** "They shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep" until the resurrection. (v.21): Even if his sons are honored or brought low, the dead man "knoweth it not" and "perceiveth it not" — complete unconsciousness. (v.14): Job anticipates waiting in the grave until resurrection.

## Focus Area 7: Spirit Returning to God at Death

### Ecclesiastes 12:1-7 — Dust returns to earth; spirit to God

Ecclesiastes 12:1	Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
Ecclesiastes 12:5	Also [when] they shall be afraid of [that which is] high, and fears [shall be] in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:
Ecclesiastes 12:6	Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
Ecclesiastes 12:7	Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

**Key (v.7):** At death, dust (body) returns to earth and ruach (spirit) returns to God "who gave it." The spirit belongs to God — it is his to give and his to receive back. This is the inverse of Gen 2:7. Does not say the spirit goes to a separate conscious existence; it "returns" to its source.

### Psalm 104:29-30 — Breath taken away = death; spirit sent = creation

Psalm 104:29	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
Psalm 104:30	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.

**Key:** God taking away breath = death, returning to dust. God sending forth spirit = new creation/life. The spirit/breath is God's to give and take.

### Job 27:3-4; 34:14-15 — Spirit as life force from God

Job 27:3	All the while my breath [is] in me, and the spirit of God [is] in my nostrils;
Job 27:4	My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.

Job 34:14	If he set his heart upon man, [if] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
Job 34:15	All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.

**Key (27:3):** "Spirit of God" (H7307 ruach + H433 eloah) is in man's nostrils — this is God's own spirit/breath animating man, not a separate human entity. (34:14-15): If God withdraws his spirit and breath, all flesh perishes and returns to dust — same as Ps 104:29.

### Acts 7:59; Luke 23:46 — Spirit commended to God at death

Acts 7:59	And they stoned Stephen, calling upon [God], and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

Luke 23:46	And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.

**Note:** These verses are often cited for a conscious soul surviving death. However, given Ecc 12:7 ("spirit returns to God who gave it"), this language of commending the spirit to God is consistent with the spirit returning to its source, not with ongoing personal consciousness. The spirit/ruach/pneuma is handed to God.

---

## Focus Area 8: Trichotomy vs. Dichotomy vs. Holistic Unity

### 1 Thessalonians 5:23 — Spirit, soul, and body

1 Thessalonians 5:23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

**Key:** Three terms: G4151 pneuma + G5590 psyche + G4983 soma. Often cited for trichotomy. However, the emphasis is "wholly" — Paul is praying for the complete person. The three terms together describe totality, not necessarily three separate substances.

### Hebrews 4:12 — Word of God divides soul and spirit

Hebrews 4:10	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.
Hebrews 4:12	For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
Hebrews 4:13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

**Key:** Soul (G5590 psyche) and spirit (G4151 pneuma) can be distinguished conceptually — the word of God can divide them. However, "joints and marrow" are also listed as a pair, and no one claims joints and marrow are two separate metaphysical substances. The verse may be using rhetorical pairs to describe total penetration of a person.

### Luke 1:46-47 — Soul and spirit used as synonymous parallels

Luke 1:46	And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,
Luke 1:47	And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

**Key:** Hebrew parallelism: "soul" (G5590 psyche) in v.46 and "spirit" (G4151 pneuma) in v.47 are parallel synonyms in poetic structure. This suggests soul and spirit can be used interchangeably, not as ontologically distinct substances.

### Mark 12:28-30 — Four terms for the inner person

Mark 12:28	And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
Mark 12:29	And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
Mark 12:30	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.

**Note:** Four terms: heart, soul (G5590 psyche), mind (G1271 dianoia), and strength. This passage does not divide humans into discrete compartments but rather uses multiple terms to call for total devotion.

### James 2:20-26 — Body without spirit is dead

James 2:20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
James 2:26	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

**Key (v.26):** Body (G4983 soma) without spirit (G4151 pneuma) = dead. This is a simple functional statement consistent with Gen 2:7's formula. Body + spirit = living person. Remove spirit = dead body.

---

## Focus Area 9: Paul's Adam Contrast (1 Cor 15)

### 1 Corinthians 15:1-58 — Full resurrection chapter

1 Corinthians 15:1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
1 Corinthians 15:6	After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
1 Corinthians 15:18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
1 Corinthians 15:20	But now is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept.
1 Corinthians 15:21	For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.
1 Corinthians 15:22	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
1 Corinthians 15:35	But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
1 Corinthians 15:36	[Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
1 Corinthians 15:39	All flesh [is] not the same flesh: but [there is] one [kind of] flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, [and] another of birds.
1 Corinthians 15:42	So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
1 Corinthians 15:43	It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
1 Corinthians 15:44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
1 Corinthians 15:45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a quickening spirit.
1 Corinthians 15:46	Howbeit that [was] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
1 Corinthians 15:47	The first man [is] of the earth, earthy: the second man [is] the Lord from heaven.
1 Corinthians 15:48	As [is] the earthy, such [are] they also that are earthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they also that are heavenly.
1 Corinthians 15:49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
1 Corinthians 15:50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
1 Corinthians 15:53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.
1 Corinthians 15:54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

**Key passages:**
- (v.6, 18, 20): Death described consistently as "sleep" — "fallen asleep" — not as soul-departure to heaven
- (v.18): "Those fallen asleep in Christ are perished" — if there is no resurrection, the sleeping dead are simply gone. Paul's argument depends on death being a sleep awaiting resurrection.
- (v.44-45): "Natural body" (G5591 psychikos soma = soul-body) sown; "spiritual body" (G4152 pneumatikos soma) raised. Adam was "a living soul" (G5590 psyche zosa, quoting LXX of Gen 2:7). Christ is "a quickening spirit" (G4151 pneuma zoopoioun).
- (v.47): First man = earthy (G5517 choikos = dust-like). Second man = heavenly.
- (v.53): Mortal must put on immortality — at the resurrection, not at death.

## Focus Area 10: Intermediate State

### 2 Corinthians 5:1-10 — Tent metaphor; absent from body

2 Corinthians 5:1	For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
2 Corinthians 5:2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
2 Corinthians 5:3	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
2 Corinthians 5:4	For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
2 Corinthians 5:5	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
2 Corinthians 5:6	Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
2 Corinthians 5:7	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
2 Corinthians 5:8	We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
2 Corinthians 5:9	Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.

**Key:** (v.3): Paul fears being found "naked" — without a body at all. He does NOT desire to be a bodiless soul; he wants to be "clothed upon" with the resurrection body. (v.8): "Absent from the body, present with the Lord" — this is the desired state. The tension in the passage is between present mortality and future immortality, with the concern that death might leave believers "naked" (without a resurrection body) for an intermediate period.

### Philippians 1:19-27 — To depart and be with Christ

Philippians 1:20	According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.
Philippians 1:21	For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.
Philippians 1:22	But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
Philippians 1:23	For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
Philippians 1:24	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.

**Key (v.23):** "To depart and be with Christ" — Paul views death as going to be with Christ. This is the strongest text for consciousness after death. The word "depart" (G360 analuō) can mean to weigh anchor, to break up camp. The question is whether this is instantaneous or at the resurrection.

### Luke 23:43 — Today in paradise

Luke 23:43	And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

**Note:** "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise." Often cited for immediate consciousness after death. Note: the thief had asked Jesus to "remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom" (v.42) — expecting a future kingdom; Jesus may have promised presence in a broader sense. Some interpreters note punctuation was added to the Greek text later; "verily I say to thee today, thou shalt be with me in paradise" (emphasis on "today I say") is a minority reading.

### Luke 16:19-31 — Rich man and Lazarus

Luke 16:19	There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
Luke 16:22	And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
Luke 16:23	And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
Luke 16:24	And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
Luke 16:25	But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
Luke 16:27	Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
Luke 16:28	For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
Luke 16:31	And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

**Note:** This is a parable (Jesus says "a certain man" — not a doctrinal statement). The genre is parabolic narrative, used to teach the importance of heeding Moses and the prophets (v.31). The dead are depicted symbolically with consciousness to serve the parable's didactic purpose.

### Revelation 6:9-11 — Souls under the altar

Revelation 6:9	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
Revelation 6:10	And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
Revelation 6:11	And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they [were], should be fulfilled.

**Note:** Martyrs' souls are depicted crying out. This is apocalyptic imagery in Revelation (a highly symbolic book). The blood of Abel "cried" from the ground (Gen 4:10) — a cry attributed to inanimate blood. The souls crying out here may similarly be symbolic/figurative. They are told to REST (v.11) — consistent with sleep imagery.

### Hebrews 12:22-24 — Spirits of just men made perfect

Hebrews 12:22	But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
Hebrews 12:23	To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
Hebrews 12:24	And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than [that of] Abel.

**Note (v.23):** "Spirits of just men made perfect" — G4151 pneuma used here. The phrase may describe the redeemed in their resurrected state rather than disembodied intermediate souls. "Made perfect" (G5048 teleioo) often refers to completion through resurrection (Heb 11:40: "that they without us should not be made perfect"). Context is arriving at the heavenly assembly, the New Jerusalem — an eschatological scene.

## Additional Key Passages

### Job 27:3; 32:8 — Ruach/neshamah as life principle in man

Job 27:3	All the while my breath [is] in me, and the spirit of God [is] in my nostrils;

Job 32:8	But [there is] a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.

**Note:** (27:3): "Breath" = H5397 neshamah; "spirit of God" = H7307 ruach + H410 El. The spirit in man IS God's own spirit/breath — not a separate human soul. (32:8): "Spirit in man" (H7307) gives understanding — the ruach functions as the cognitive/spiritual faculty.

### Proverbs 20:27 — Spirit is the candle of the LORD

Proverbs 20:27	The spirit of man [is] the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.

**Key:** H5397 neshamah of man is described as "the candle of the LORD" — it is God's light within man, enabling self-examination. The neshamah functions as a God-given capacity for moral/spiritual awareness.

### Zechariah 12:1 — God forms the spirit within man

Zechariah 12:1	The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.

**Key:** God "formeth" (H3335 yatsar — same verb as Gen 2:7 "formed man of dust") the spirit within man. This parallels Gen 2:7 — both the body and the spirit/breath are God's creative work. Ruach is not an eternal pre-existing entity; it is formed by God.

### Isaiah 26:19 — Resurrection of the dead

Isaiah 26:19	Thy dead [men] shall live, [together with] my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew [is as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

**Key:** "Dwell in dust" — the dead are in the dust, awaiting resurrection. "Awake and sing" — resurrection is awakening from sleep in dust. Consistent with Dan 12:2 and Gen 2:7 reversal.

### 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 — Dead in Christ sleep; rise at coming

1 Thessalonians 4:13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
1 Thessalonians 4:14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
Acts 7:60	And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
1 Thessalonians 4:15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
1 Thessalonians 4:16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
1 Thessalonians 4:17	Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians 4:18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

**Key:** Paul's comfort for those grieving the dead is not "they are in heaven now." The comfort is resurrection (v.16-17). "Dead in Christ shall rise first" — they are currently dead (sleeping), not yet present with Christ. They rise at the coming, THEN "we shall ever be with the Lord."
