*Note: concept_context.py for Mat 25:46 identified concepts RIGHTEOUSNESS (G1342) and LIFE (G2222). The punishment/aionios keyword was not independently indexed as a concept by this tool — the tool detected the positive pole (righteous, life) but not the kolasin/aionion lexical pair specifically.*

*Note: concept_context.py for 2Th 1:9 detected only GLORY (G1391) as the indexed concept. The olethron aionion (destruction) vocabulary was not independently indexed as a named concept by this tool. The glory concept connects to the immediate context (2Th 1:9 — "from the glory of his power") and Paul's recurring glory theology (1Co 2:7-8; 15:40-43) — relevant for understanding that olethron aionion is a separation from the presence and glory of the Lord.*

## 2 Thessalonians 1:9 — concept_context.py --scope author

*Output identical to the standard run (same Pauline corpus "glory" results).*

*Research note: The concept_context tool indexed RIGHTEOUSNESS, LIFE, and GLORY in these verses. The tool's concept taxonomy does not have a separate entry for DESTRUCTION/PUNISHMENT or ETERNAL as indexed categories, so the aionios/olethros/kolasis vocabulary was not directly surfaced. The concept connections are most useful for the positive pole (life/righteousness in Mat 25:46) and for the glory-separation theme in 2Th 1:9. The parallels file (raw-data/parallels.md) provides the more directly relevant cross-testament connections via semantic embedding.*
