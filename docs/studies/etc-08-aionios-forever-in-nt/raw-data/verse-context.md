  Matthew 25:46
======================================================================

  "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."

  Testament: NT | Author: Matthew | Words: 14

```

*Note: Most similar verse (Galatians 6:8) — "sow to the flesh → corruption; sow to the Spirit → life everlasting." The two-outcomes pattern (corrupt/life) parallels Mat 25:46's two-outcomes pattern (punishment/life). Galatians 6:8 uses "corruption" (phthoran) as the negative outcome, not eternal torment vocabulary. Acts 13:48 also parallels the eternal life positive pole.*

## 2 Thessalonians 1:9 — query_verse_context.py --theological

```
======================================================================
  Theological Parallels: 2 Thessalonians 1:9
======================================================================

  "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"

  Concepts Detected:
    - GLORY (70%) — G1391

  Conceptually Related Passages (OT — top 20, all share GLORY concept):
    Genesis 13:2; 18:20; 31:1; 34:19; 45:13; 48:10; 49:6
    Exodus 5:9; 8:15; 8:32; 9:7; 9:34; 10:1; 14:4; 14:17; 14:18; 16:7; 16:10; 20:12; 24:16
    [Full list: primarily "glory of the LORD" passages across Torah and Psalms]
```

*Note: The --theological flag for 2Th 1:9 returned only GLORY-concept parallels because the tool's indexed concepts detected "glory of his power" but not "destruction" or "punishment" as indexed concepts. The most relevant connection is the "from the presence of the Lord" (apo prosopou Kuriou) phrase — a separation formula. The glory-presence connection is captured in Exodus passages about the glory/presence of the LORD.*

## 2 Thessalonians 1:9 — query_verse_context.py --similar

```
======================================================================
  2 Thessalonians 1:9
======================================================================

  "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"

  Testament: NT | Author: Paul | Words: 20

  Similar Verses:
    1. 2 Corinthians 3:18 (18%)
       "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord."
    2. Ephesians 6:10 (17%)
       "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."
```

*Note: The --similar flag found only 2 NT parallels with meaningful similarity scores. The low scores (18%, 17%) reflect that 2Th 1:9's specific combination of destruction vocabulary + separation-from-presence + glory formula is distinctive within Paul. The cross-testament parallels tool (raw-data/parallels.md) returned more directly relevant results via semantic embedding.*

---

*Research note: The query_verse_context.py tool was run for both key verses. The theological flag surfaced OT LIFE+RIGHTEOUSNESS parallels for Mat 25:46 (useful for establishing the two-outcome pattern across both testaments) and GLORY parallels for 2Th 1:9 (useful for the presence/glory of the Lord separation theme). The similar flag confirmed that Galatians 6:8 is the closest parallel to Mat 25:46 in semantic structure — which is notable because Gal 6:8 uses "corruption" (not torment) as the negative outcome.*
