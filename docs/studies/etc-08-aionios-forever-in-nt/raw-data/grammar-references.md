      For the most part, we are regarding those words as pronouns that, when func-
      tioning substantivally, do not take the article. Adjectives, on the other hand, regularly take the
      article when substituting for a noun.

      The adjective may be either attributive or predicate in relation to the noun. That is, it may either
      modify the noun (attributive) or make a statement about it (predicate).

*Note: The search for "-ios suffix" did not return a direct citation on the Greek adjectival suffix -ios as a denominal formation meaning "pertaining to." This is a standard morphological fact documented in Greek grammars (e.g., Moulton-Turner, BDF §112) but not indexed as a specific section in the available grammar database. The Wallace references (p.137-143) cover attributive vs. predicate adjective use — relevant for parsing aionios in context but not specifically about the -ios morpheme.*

*Note: The alpha-privative search returned low scores (max 0.261) — the concept is indexed in the grammar database but without a dedicated high-density section. Hudson p.184 is likely the most relevant (word formation prefix list). The alpha-privative principle (a- prefix negates the root, e.g., a-thanatos = un-death = immortal; a-phtharsía = un-corruption = incorruptibility) is standard Greek morphology. The key point for this study is that aionios is NOT formed with the alpha-privative — it is formed as aion + -ios (denominal adjective = "pertaining to the age"), whereas the genuinely "endless" concepts in Greek use alpha-privative formations: athanasia (G110, 1Co 15:53-54; 1Ti 6:16), aphtharsia (G861, 1Co 15:42,50-54; 2Ti 1:10), apelantos or similar.*

## Search: "temporal adjective past time" (Greek)

  GRAMMAR SEARCH: "temporal adjective past time"  (GREEK)
======================================================================

  [1] Basics of New Testament Syntax (Wallace)  p.217  [score: 0.494]  [greek]
      To sum up: In general, time is absolute in the indicative, relative in the par-
      ticiple, and nonexistent in the other moods. 2. Portrayal Vs. Reality of Time
      Although an author may use a tense in the indicative, the time indicated by
      that tense may be other than or broader than the real time of the action.

  [2] Greek Grammar of the NT (Blass-Debrunner-Funk)  p.201  [score: 0.487]  [greek]
      In Greek the temporal significance of the corresponding
      indicatives has been carried over to a much smaller degree to the moods
      (subjunctive and optative, also to the infinitive and participle), and
      then it is, of course, so-called relative time, i.e. the
      time of the action is relative to the time of the main verb.

  [3] Basics of New Testament Syntax (Wallace)  p.62  [score: 0.477]  [greek]
      This notion requires a preposition. Cf. Phil 1:5, for
      example, apo tes protes hemeras achri tou nun ("from the first day until now"):
      this is not kind of time, but span of time.

      Three Kinds of Time and the Verb Mood
      Three kinds of time may be portrayed by tense: past, present, future. These
      are natural to English, but some languages employ other ideas—e.g., past, non-
      past; near, far; completed, uncompleted; etc.

  [6] Basics of New Testament Syntax (Wallace)  p.216  [score: 0.456]  [greek]
      b. Participle. Time is very often involved in a participle, although here it is
      relative (or dependent). Time with participles (especially adverbial participles)
      depends on the time of the main verb.

      Outside the indicative and participle, time is not a feature of the aorist.
```

*Note: The grammar database returned results on verbal tense and time-reference, not specifically on adjectival temporal reference (which is the relevant topic for aionios's past-time uses in Rom 16:25; 2Ti 1:9; Tit 1:2). The Wallace p.215-217 discussion of "Portrayal Vs. Reality of Time" is indirectly relevant — the point that "the time indicated by a tense may be other than or broader than the real time of the action" has an analogy for adjectives: the temporal scope indicated by an adjective may be broader than what the lexicon implies. BDF p.201 on "relative time" is also indirectly relevant.*

*The most direct grammatical support for the bidirectional use of aionios comes from the lexicon itself (G166 BLB definition: "perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well)") rather than from syntax textbooks.*

*Research note: The semantic_grammar.py searches returned grammar references on adjective formation and temporal usage, but did not find a dedicated grammar section specifically on the -ios denominal suffix or the alpha-privative as it applies to the aionios/aidios lexical distinction. The morphological argument for this study relies primarily on lexicography (BLB definitions of G166, G126, G104) and word-formation principles (documented in Thayer, BDAG, and Liddell-Scott but not in the grammar database indexed here).*
