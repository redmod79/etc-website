## 1. Question and Summary Answer

**Question:** What does the Greek word aionios (G166) mean in the New Testament? Does it always mean "eternal/endless" or can it mean "age-long/pertaining to an age"? Examine all 71 NT occurrences of aionios. Does the semantic range of aionios require endless conscious torment for the wicked? How does aionios compare to aidios (G126)? What does "for ever and ever" (eis tous aionas ton aionon) mean in the judgment passages?

**Summary Answer:** Aionios (G166) is a denominal adjective formed from aion + -ios ("pertaining to the age"). Its BLB definition explicitly acknowledges that it is "perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well)." Its LXX source (H5769 olam) carries the same contextually-determined quality established in N034 (Hab 3:6). The word's actual duration in any given context is determined by the nature of the subject to which it is applied (N034, N035, N036). It is not an alpha-privative formation and does not inherently mean "endless" (N037).

Evidence from 71 BLB occurrences: aionios refers to past ages (Rom 16:25; 2Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2), a human relationship bounded by lifespan (Phm 1:15), completed events whose results are permanent (Heb 9:12 — ephapax), and Sodom's fire that produced ashes (Jude 1:7 + 2Pet 2:6). The Greek word that does carry the "inherent everduring" meaning is aidios (G126, from aei = "always"), which has only 2 NT occurrences — and when Jude uses both words in adjacent verses, he uses aidios for the fallen angels' currently ongoing confinement and aionios for Sodom's completed destructive fire.

For the "for ever and ever" (eis tous aionas ton aionon) phrase: it uses G165 (the plural noun aion), not G166 (the adjective aionios). In the three judgment applications, the grammatical subject of the ascending smoke passages is the smoke itself (Rev 14:11; 19:3), and the torment-for-ever language of Rev 20:10 is applied to three specifically named supernatural/symbolic entities — with no equivalent language applied to generic human wicked in the immediately following verse (Rev 20:15).

The central eschatological term in Mat 25:46 is kolasis (G2851 — penal infliction from kolazo = to prune/curtail), not basanismos (torment). Paul's chosen eschatological noun in 2Th 1:9 is olethros (G3639 — ruin/destruction), not basanismos. The torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos) is confined to Revelation in eschatological contexts.

## 2. Key Verses

| Group | Verse | What It Shows |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Central | Mat 25:46 | Both kolasin aionion and zoen aionion use identical A-ASF form; noun is kolasis (penal infliction), not torment |
| Word choice | Rom 1:20 | Paul chose aidios (G126, from "always") for God's power, not aionios (from "age") |
| Adjacent contrast | Jude 1:6-7 | aidios for ongoing angel confinement; aionios for Sodom's completed fire (same letter, adjacent verses) |
| Past-time | Rom 16:25; 2Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2 | Aionios refers to elapsed past ages — the word is bidirectional |
| Human relationship | Phm 1:15 | Aionios modifies Onesimus (mortal human) — bounded duration |
| Event-noun | Heb 9:12 | Eternal redemption obtained ephapax (once for all) — permanent result, single completed act |
| Sodom as definition | Jude 1:7 + 2Pet 2:6 | Eternal fire on Sodom → ashes; "eternal" = permanent result, not ongoing fire |
| Subject differentiation | Rev 20:9-15 | Human armies = devoured; devil/beast/false prophet = tormented; human wicked (v.15) = no torment language |
| Grammatical subject | Rev 14:11 | ho kapnos (the smoke) is nominative subject of anabainei; not the persons |
| Aion root | Mat 28:20 | synteleia tou aionos — the age from which aionios derives has an END |

## 3. Full Analysis

### 3.1 Lexical Baseline

G166 (aionios): from G165 (aion = "an age"). BLB definition: "perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well)." 71 BLB occurrences; 12 unique KJV renderings across 48 KJV occurrences.

G126 (aidios): from G104 (aei = "always/continually"). BLB definition: "everduring (forward and backward, or forward)." 2 NT occurrences only (Rom 1:20; Jude 1:6).

The words have different roots, different definitions, and demonstrably different uses by the same NT authors in adjacent contexts.

### 3.2 Morphological Analysis

Aionios is formed as aion + -ios (the Greek denominal adjectival suffix meaning "pertaining to" or "characteristic of"). The same suffix appears in ouranios (heavenly, from ouranos), ephemerios (daily, from ephemera). The word is structurally "age-pertaining" — it says nothing about infinite duration.

The Greek formations for genuine inherent endlessness are alpha-privative: athanasia (G110 = un-death-ness), aphtharsia (G861 = un-corruption), athanatos (G110 adj. = un-dying). Aionios is NOT an alpha-privative formation. The word most naturally read as "inherently endless" in Greek is aidios (from aei = always, the adverb of continued unbroken duration) — which is why Paul chose aidios (not aionios) for God's power in Rom 1:20.

### 3.3 Distribution Analysis

Subject-categorized groupings:
- Group A (positive eschatological — ~37 occurrences): eternal life (zoe aionios), eternal glory, eternal covenant, eternal Spirit, eternal gospel, eternal inheritance, eternal consolation, eternal house, eternal weight of glory
- Group B (negative eschatological — ~7 occurrences): eternal fire (3x), eternal punishment (1x), eternal destruction (1x), eternal sin/damnation (1x), eternal judgment (1x)
- Group C (non-eschatological — ~14 occurrences): past-time references (3x), human relationship (1x), event-nouns (redemption, salvation, covenant, Spirit, inheritance)
- Group D (aion noun uses in context): root noun demonstrates the age has an end (synteleia tou aionos)

The "eternal life" group is by far the largest (over half of all occurrences). The Group B negative uses are approximately 10% of the total.

### 3.4 The Aidios vs. Aionios Distinction

The two words are not synonyms and are not interchangeable in NT usage. Paul uses aionios for eternal life throughout his epistles (Rom 2:7; 5:21; 6:22,23; Gal 6:8; 1Tim 1:16; etc.). But when Paul wishes to describe God's intrinsic divine power as genuinely everduring, he uses aidios (G126, from aei = always) in Rom 1:20.

Jude's adjacent usage (Jude 1:6-7) is definitionally important: aidios (desmois aidiois, ongoing/currently active chains) for fallen angels, and aionios (puros aioniou, the fire on Sodom) for a past, completed judgment. The fire on Sodom is not currently burning; its "eternal" character is the permanent result.

### 3.5 Past-Time Uses (Group C)

Three NT verses use G166 for elapsed, past ages:

- **Rom 16:25**: chronois aioniois seseigemenou — "kept silent in age-long times" (KJV: "since the world began"). The mystery was hidden DURING the past ages. Aionios looks backward.
- **2Tim 1:9**: pro chronon aionion — "before age-long times" (KJV: "before the world began"). Grace given before the age-period began.
- **Tit 1:2**: pro chronon aionion (same construction) + zoes aionion (eternal life) in the SAME VERSE. The same adjective looks backward ("before age-long times") and forward ("eternal life") in a single verse.

A word that demonstrably refers to past elapsed time cannot be inherently "forward-pointing endless."

### 3.6 Event-Noun Pattern (Hebrews)

When aionios modifies an EVENT NOUN — a noun naming a completed act — it describes the permanent result, not an ongoing process:

- Heb 9:12: lutrosin aionion (eternal redemption) — obtained ephapax (once for all, Aorist); single completed act, permanent result
- Heb 5:9: soterian aionion (eternal salvation) — accomplished by Christ's obedience; act is complete
- Heb 6:2: krimatos aioniou (eternal judgment) — verdict rendered once; the aionios character = irrevocability
- Heb 9:14-15: pneumatos aioniou + kleronomian aionion (eternal Spirit; eternal inheritance)
- Heb 13:20: diathekes aionious (everlasting covenant)

When Mat 25:46 (kolasin aionion = everlasting punishment) and 2Th 1:9 (olethron aionion = everlasting destruction) are read alongside these Hebrews uses, the event-noun pattern extends: punishment and destruction are completed acts whose permanent results are described as aionion.

### 3.7 Mat 25:46 — The Central Passage

Greek: kai apeleusontai houtoi eis kolasin aionion, hoi de dikaioi eis zoen aionion.

The adjective aionion appears twice, both in the same grammatical form (Accusative Singular Feminine, A-ASF). Both nouns are A-ASF: kolasin (G2851, punishment) and zoen (G2222, life).

The critical noun: kolasis (G2851) = "penal infliction" from kolazo (to prune/curtail). This is NOT basanismos (torment). Kolasis appears only twice in the NT (Mat 25:46; 1Jn 4:18). The etymology (pruning/curtailing) emphasizes the punitive/restrictive dimension without specifying an ongoing mechanism.

The symmetry argument (same adjective = same duration for both) is a legitimate inference. It is I-B because: (a) aionios demonstrably adapts to its referent's nature (N034/N035/N036), and (b) the nouns differ — zoe (life) is by definition an ongoing state; kolasis (punishment) is not by definition an ongoing state (one can punish once, with permanent effect). The OT top parallel for Mat 25:46 (Ezk 18:21, score 0.391) grounds the two-outcome structure in the life/death framework of Ezekiel 18, not in a torment/life framework.

### 3.8 "For Ever and Ever" (eis tous aionas ton aionon)

This phrase uses G165 (the plural noun aion), NOT G166 (the adjective aionios). Literally: "into the ages of the ages."

Applied to God/Christ (14-15 occurrences): Gal 1:5; 1Ti 1:17; Heb 1:8; 13:21; 1Pe 4:11; Rev 1:6; 4:9,10; 5:13,14; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 15:7; 22:5. Here the "ages of ages" is genuinely endless because God's nature is genuinely without limit.

Applied to judgment subjects (3 occurrences):
- Rev 14:11: "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" — grammatical subject is ho kapnos (the smoke, N-NSM nominative), not the persons. OT source: Isa 34:10 (smoke of Edom's desolation — permanent ruin formula).
- Rev 19:3: "her smoke rose up for ever and ever" — Babylon's smoke (grammatical subject = smoke).
- Rev 20:10: "shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever" — subjects: devil, beast, false prophet (three named supernatural/symbolic entities). Rev 20:15 (immediately following) applies no such language to generic human wicked.

### 3.9 Rev 20:9-15 — Subject Differentiation

Adjacent verses in the same passage use distinct vocabulary for distinct subjects:
- Rev 20:9: Human armies → katephagen (devoured, consumed) — DESTRUCTION vocabulary
- Rev 20:10: Devil, beast, false prophet → basanisthesontai (shall be tormented) — TORMENT vocabulary
- Rev 20:14: Lake of fire → "the second death" — DEATH identification
- Rev 20:15: Generic human wicked → cast into lake of fire — no "tormented for ever and ever" language

The "tormented day and night for ever and ever" language is applied to three specifically named entities and is not repeated for the general human wicked in the very next verse where they appear.

### 3.10 Vocabulary Distribution Summary

Torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos):
- G929 (basanismos = torment, noun): 6 occurrences, ALL in Revelation
- G928 (basanizo = torment, verb): eschatological uses ONLY in Revelation
- Neither appears in any didactic epistle's eschatological teaching

Destruction vocabulary for the wicked:
- Paul in 2Th 1:9: olethros (destruction)
- Jesus in Mat 25:46: kolasis (penal infliction, not ongoing torment)
- Both authors consistently use destruction/punishment vocabulary, not torment vocabulary

| 2 | G166 (aionios) is translated by 12 distinct KJV English expressions across 48 KJV occurrences — the widest translation distribution of any eschatological-class Greek adjective studied, including "since the world began" (Rom 16:25) and "for ever" (Phm 1:15). | G166 KJV distribution data | Neutral | E198 |
| 3 | G126 (aidios) is defined as "everduring (forward and backward, or forward)" — from G104 (aei = "always/continually" adverb of unbroken duration). Its root (aei) denotes inherent, uninterrupted continuity. | G126 BLB Lexicon; G104 BLB Lexicon | Neutral | E199 |

| 5 | Paul used aidios (G126, A-NSF, from aei = "always") to describe God's power (dunamis) and divine nature (theiotēs) in Romans 1:20, while using aionios (G166) for eternal life throughout the same epistle (Rom 2:7; 5:21; 6:22,23). Two distinct words by the same author in the same letter. | Rom 1:20 (G126 parsing confirmed); Rom 2:7 (G166) | Neutral | E201 |
| 6 | Jude uses aidios (G126, A-DPM) for the fallen angels' desmois (chains — ongoing, active confinement, confirmed by perfect tense teterekën) in Jude 1:6 and aionios (G166, A-GSN) for Sodom's puros (fire) in Jude 1:7 — adjacent verses, same letter, two different words for two different situations. | Jude 1:6; Jude 1:7 | Neutral | E202 |
| 7 | Titus 1:2 contains two occurrences of G166 in the same verse: zoes aionion (eternal life — forward-looking) and pro chronon aionion (before age-long times — backward-looking to pre-creation). The same adjective operates in both temporal directions within a single verse. | Tit 1:2 (Greek parsing) | Neutral | E203 |
| 8 | Romans 16:25 — chronois aioniois seseigemenou (Dat Pl M: "having been kept silent in age-long times") — uses G166 (A-DPM) for elapsed past ages. KJV renders this "since the world began." Aionios points backward to elapsed historical ages. | Rom 16:25 | Neutral | E204 |
| 9 | 2 Timothy 1:9 — pro chronon aionion — uses G166 (A-GPM) for the period before the ages began. KJV: "before the world began." Grace was given before the age-long times. | 2Tim 1:9 | Neutral | E205 |
| 10 | Philemon 1:15 — hina aionion auton apecheis — G166 (A-ASM) modifies Onesimus (auton, a mortal human). Paul says Philemon will have him back "for ever" (KJV). Neither Philemon nor Onesimus is immortal; the "for ever" is bounded by their natural lifespans. | Phm 1:15 | Neutral | E206 |
| 11 | Hebrews 9:12 — eiselthen ephapax (entered ONCE FOR ALL, Aorist Indicative) + aionion lutrosin heuramenos (Aorist Active Participle: "having obtained eternal redemption"). Ephapax (G2178) = "once for all" — a single completed act. Aionios modifies the result (redemption) of a completed, unrepeatable act. | Heb 9:12 (Greek parsing) | Neutral | E207 |
| 12 | Matthew 25:46 — kolasin aionion (Acc Sg F) and zoen aionion (Acc Sg F) — both instances of aionion are grammatically identical (A-ASF). Both governing nouns are also Accusative Singular Feminine: kolasin (G2851, N-ASF) and zoen (G2222, N-ASF). The grammatical parallelism is exact. | Mat 25:46 (Greek parsing confirmed) | Neutral | E208 |
| 13 | Matthew 25:46 — the negative noun is kolasis (G2851 = "penal infliction" from kolazo = to prune/curtail/restrain). Kolasis appears only twice in the NT (Mat 25:46; 1Jn 4:18). It is NOT basanismos (G929 = torment) and NOT olethros (G3639 = destruction). The word names a category of outcome (punitive infliction) without specifying the mechanism as ongoing conscious suffering. | Mat 25:46; 1Jn 4:18 (G2851 BLB data) | Neutral | E209 |
| 14 | In 2 Thessalonians 1:9, Paul's chosen eschatological noun for the fate of the wicked is olethros (G3639 = ruin/destruction), NOT basanismos (torment) and NOT kolasis (punishment). Paul consistently uses olethros for destruction outcomes: 1Th 5:3 (sudden destruction), 1Co 5:5 (destruction of the flesh), 1Ti 6:9 (destruction and perdition). | 2Th 1:9; comparative olethros survey | Neutral | E210 |
| 15 | Revelation 14:11 — Greek parsing confirmed: ho kapnos (G2586, N-NSM, THE SMOKE) is the NOMINATIVE grammatical subject of anabainei (ascends). Basanismou (G929, N-GSM = torment) is a GENITIVE attribute of the smoke ("the smoke of [the] torment"). The smoke ascends; the "for ever and ever" applies to the ascending smoke. | Rev 14:11 (Greek parsing) | Neutral | E211 |
| 16 | Revelation 20:10 names three specific subjects of "tormented day and night for ever and ever": the devil (diabolos), the beast (to therion), and the false prophet (ho pseudoprophetes). The immediately following context (Rev 20:15) casts generic human wicked into the lake of fire without repeating the "tormented day and night for ever and ever" language. | Rev 20:10; Rev 20:15 | Neutral | E212 |
| 17 | The phrase "for ever and ever" in the NT is eis tous aionas ton aionon — literally "into the ages of the ages" — using G165 (the plural noun aion), NOT G166 (the adjective aionios). The two Greek forms are distinct: noun vs. adjective, with distinct roots and BLB counts (G165 = 128 BLB; G166 = 71 BLB). | NT phrase survey; G165 and G166 BLB data | Neutral | E213 |
| 18 | Matthew 25:41 — hetoimasmenon (G2090, V-RPP-ASN: perfect passive participle = "having been prepared") — the fire is already prepared; the action is complete. Diabolō (G1228, A-DSM) and angelois (G32, N-DPM) are DATIVE — the fire was prepared FOR (dative of purpose) the devil and his angels. | Mat 25:41 (Greek parsing) | Neutral | E214 |
| 19 | Mark 3:29 — the Nestle-Aland/N1904 Greek text reads enochos estin aioniou hamartematos ("guilty of an eternal SIN" — hamartematos, G265, N-GSN = sin/offense). The "eternal" quality attaches to the sin/offense, not merely to a judgment verdict; the offense is characterized as age-long/permanent in its character. | Mrk 3:29 (N1904 Greek text) | Neutral | E215 |
| 20 | John 17:3 — "This IS eternal life, that they might KNOW thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent." Aionios life is defined by Jesus himself as a relationship of knowing God — the hina clause states the content of what eternal life consists in, not merely its duration. | Jhn 17:3 | Neutral | E216 |
| 21 | Matthew 13:39,40,49; 24:3; 28:20 — synteleia tou aionos = "the end of the age." The Greek root noun aion (G165), from which the adjective aionios (G166) derives, explicitly has an END (synteleia = completion/end) in five NT passages by the same author (Matthew). | Mat 13:39,40,49; 24:3; 28:20 | Neutral | E217 |
| 22 | Mark 10:30 — "in the world to come eternal life" — the same verse contains both aioni (G165, N-DSM: the age/world) and zoen aionion (G166 adjective: eternal/age-long life). The derivational relationship between the noun aion and the adjective aionios is linguistically transparent in this single verse. | Mrk 10:30 | Neutral | E218 |

### 4.2 Necessary Implications (N)

#### New N Items (this study)

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Classification | Master ID |
|---|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | Aionios (G166) cannot be inherently forward-pointing endless, because it demonstrably refers to past elapsed time in three NT passages by two different authors. A word that looks backward to past ages cannot be defined as inherently "pointing only forward without end." | E197 (BLB definition explicitly states past-time use); E203 (Tit 1:2: same verse, both directions); E204 (Rom 16:25: past ages); E205 (2Tim 1:9: before ages began); N035 (inherited from olam, which similarly looks backward) | Three independent past-time uses from two different authors (Paul twice, Titus). The BLB definition itself explicitly states the past-time function. No interpretation is required; the past-time uses are the textual data. | Neutral | N036 |
| 2 | The Greek morphological structure of aionios (aion + -ios = denominal adjective "pertaining to the age") is not an alpha-privative formation and therefore does not inherently assert infinite, unending duration. The words that inherently assert unending duration in Greek are alpha-privative (athanasia, aphtharsia, athanatos). Aionios is not in that category. | E197 (aionios derives from aion, not from alpha + ending); E199 (aidios, from aei = always, is the word for inherent endlessness — different derivation); E200-E201 (Paul used the different, inherently-endless word aidios when he needed to express God's intrinsic everduring power) | The morphological analysis is an observable, non-controversial fact about Greek word formation. Both aionios and aidios are classified as adjectives in NT Greek lexicons with different etymological origins. That Paul used two different words for different purposes is an observable textual fact. | Neutral | N037 |

| 1 | The identical grammatical construction of Mat 25:46 (same A-ASF form aionion for both outcomes: kolasin aionion and zoen aionion) means that "everlasting punishment" and "eternal life" have the same type and duration of existence — so if one is endless, so is the other, and if one is permanent-result, so is the other. | **FOR (symmetry argument):** E208 (same A-ASF form, grammatically identical for both nouns); E119 (same adjective, both outcomes stated by Jesus in same verse). **AGAINST (referent-nature argument):** N034 (duration = nature of subject from Hab 3:6 — same verse, demonstrably different durations for different subjects); N035 (aionios inherits olam's subject-dependent quality); N036 (aionios demonstrably backward-pointing in 3 NT uses — cannot be inherently "forward-endless"); E206 (Phm 1:15 — aionios for mortal human, bounded duration); E207 (Heb 9:12 — aionios for completed act); IB011 (Dan 12:2 symmetry resolved Moderate toward referent-nature); E209 (the noun is kolasis = penal infliction, not basanismos = torment — the nouns differ in mechanism implications) | The grammatical symmetry is an observable textual fact (E208 = E tier). What the symmetry implies about specific duration of the two outcomes is I-B: the symmetry argument and the referent-nature argument both have E/N support. This is structurally identical to IB011 (Dan 12:2) applied to the NT. | #2 (choosing between symmetry-governs-duration and referent-nature-governs-duration readings) | **Moderate — weight toward referent-nature interpretation.** N034 (Hab 3:6: same word, same verse, demonstrably different durations) is a necessary implication directly addressing how to read the same word applied to different referents in the same text. This governs the Mat 25:46 symmetry via #4a SIS (shared vocabulary principle, same-word-different-referents). The noun difference (kolasis = penal infliction vs. zoe = life as an ongoing state by definition) corroborates the referent-nature reading. The symmetry observation remains a legitimate Neutral textual fact. | IB012 |

## 5. I-B Resolution Detail

### IB012 — Mat 25:46 Symmetry (New)

**The competing evidence:**

FOR symmetry-governs-duration (ECT reading):
- E208: Both aionion instances are A-ASF — grammatically identical. The same adjective applied in the same form to both outcomes should govern both identically.
- E119: Jesus uses the same single word (aionion) for both outcomes in the same sentence. It is the most natural reading to apply it consistently.
- IB011 (established): Dan 12:2 uses the same olam construct for both outcomes — the symmetry argument is consistent with the OT precedent.

AGAINST symmetry-governs-duration (conditionalist reading):
- N034 (Necessary): Hab 3:6 demonstrates that the same word (olam/ad) in the same verse applies to mountains that scatter and God's ways that endure — demonstrably different durations. The word adapts to referent nature.
- N035 (Necessary): Aionios inherits this quality from olam via LXX.
- N036 (New): Aionios demonstrably refers to past elapsed time — cannot be inherently "forward-pointing endless."
- E206 (Phm 1:15): Aionios modifies a mortal human's relationship — bounded duration. The same adjective applied to a mortal person cannot mean "literally without end."
- E207 (Heb 9:12): Aionios applied to a completed once-for-all act — the "eternal" quality is the permanence of the result, not the ongoing duration of the act.
- E209: The negative noun is kolasis (penal infliction), not basanismos (torment). The nouns differ: zoe (life) is inherently an ongoing state by definition; kolasis (punishment) is not inherently an ongoing state — one can punish once with permanent effect. The symmetry of the adjective does not require symmetry of the nouns' mechanisms.
- IB011 (established): Dan 12:2 symmetry already resolved Moderate toward referent-nature on identical structural grounds.

**SIS Resolution steps (5-step I-B protocol):**

1. **Both sides acknowledged:** The grammatical parallelism (E208) is a real textual fact. The referent-nature principle (N034) is a necessary implication from a different text (Hab 3:6). Both have genuine scriptural grounding.

2. **Stronger/clearer evidence identified:** N034 is a NECESSARY IMPLICATION (not merely an inference), established from a same-verse, same-word, demonstrably-different-duration observation in Hab 3:6. N034 constitutes the clearest possible demonstration of the word's subject-dependency: two simultaneous applications of the same word to referents of demonstrably different durational nature in the same verse.

3. **#4a SIS connection:** N034 addresses specifically "how do you read the same olam/aionios word applied to different referents in the same text?" The Mat 25:46 symmetry is precisely this pattern. N034 governs via same-vocabulary, same-syntactic-pattern connection.

4. **Noun difference considered:** The positive noun (zoe = life) is inherently an ongoing state — to be alive is to be living. The negative noun (kolasis = penal infliction from kolazo = to prune/curtail) does not inherently require an ongoing state. If the wicked undergo a permanent, irrevocable punishment whose nature is judicial condemnation, the aionion quality describes the permanence of that verdict — consistent with E207's event-noun pattern (eternal redemption = completed act, permanent result). The adjective symmetry does not require mechanism symmetry.

5. **Resolution:** **Moderate — weight toward referent-nature interpretation.** The symmetry of the adjective is a real textual fact (Neutral, E208). The inference that this symmetry determines identical duration for both outcomes faces the established necessary implication N034 (which directly addresses same-word-applied-to-different-referents) and IB011 (which already resolved the same structural argument about Dan 12:2 in favor of referent-nature). The referent-nature reading is more consistent with the full NT distribution of aionios.

## 8. Conclusion

This study examined 71 BLB occurrences of aionios (G166) across the full NT vocabulary. The lexical, morphological, grammatical, and distributional evidence establishes the following neutral textual observations:

1. **Aionios is not a word of inherent endlessness.** It is formed as aion + -ios ("age-pertaining"), not as an alpha-privative ("un-ending"). The word that carries inherent endlessness in Greek is aidios (from aei = always), which has only 2 NT occurrences — and NT authors demonstrably used both words for different purposes in adjacent contexts.

2. **Aionios demonstrably refers to past time.** Three NT uses (Rom 16:25; 2Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2) use aionios for elapsed past ages. The BLB definition explicitly documents this bidirectional function.

3. **Aionios's duration is contextually determined by its referent.** The same adjective modifies God's eternal attributes (genuinely endless), past ages (elapsed), a human relationship (bounded by lifespan), completed events (permanent result of a single act), and Sodom's fire (produced ashes). This pattern is consistent with N034 (established from Hab 3:6) and N035 (LXX inheritance from olam).

4. **The central eschatological debate passage (Mat 25:46) uses kolasis (penal infliction), not basanismos (torment).** The grammatical symmetry of aionion is a textual fact (E208). Whether that symmetry requires identical duration or allows referent-determined duration is I-B (IB012), resolved Moderate toward referent-nature on the same structural grounds as IB011 (Dan 12:2).

5. **The "for ever and ever" language in Revelation's judgment passages is applied to specific, named subjects:** the smoke of torment (Rev 14:11; 19:3) and the devil, beast, and false prophet (Rev 20:10) — not to the generic human wicked, for whom immediately adjacent verses (Rev 20:9; 20:15) use destruction/death vocabulary.

6. **The torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos) is confined to Revelation in the NT.** Neither Paul nor any other epistle writer uses this vocabulary for the fate of the wicked in didactic passages. Paul uses olethros (destruction); Jesus uses kolasis (punishment). The distribution is an observable lexical fact (E172, E181, E210, E209).

The evidence from this study is overwhelmingly Neutral in classification — these are lexical and grammatical observations that both ECT and conditionalist interpreters must incorporate into their frameworks. The conditionalist conclusions (N036, N037, IA022, IB012 moderate resolution) follow from applying the established N034/N035 framework to NT aionios data and from the morphological analysis of the word's formation.
