## Group A — Aionios + Positive Outcomes (Eternal Life Passages)

### Matthew 19:16,29 (eternal life — rich young ruler)
**Mat 19:16:** And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

**Jhn 3:15:** That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
**Jhn 3:16:** For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
**Jhn 3:17:** For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
**Jhn 3:36:** He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

### John 4:14,36 (eternal life — water/harvest)
**Jhn 4:14:** But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
**Jhn 4:36:** And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.

**Jhn 10:28:** And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand.

*Greek text (Jhn 17:3):* αὕτη δέ ἐστιν ἡ αἰώνιος ζωή, ἵνα γινώσκωσιν σὲ τὸν μόνον ἀληθινὸν Θεόν
*Note: aionios (G166, A-NSF) modifies zoe (G2222, N-NSF). This is the key definition verse — eternal life is defined as knowing God, not as a duration qualifier.*

### Acts 13:46,48 (eternal life — to the Gentiles)
**Act 13:46:** Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
**Act 13:48:** And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.

### Romans 2:7 (eternal life — to those who seek glory)
**Rom 2:7:** To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:

### Romans 5:21 (eternal life — grace reigning through righteousness)

### Romans 6:22-23 (eternal life — fruit of holiness)
**Rom 6:22:** But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

### Galatians 6:8 (eternal life — sowing to the Spirit)
**Gal 6:8:** For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

### 1 Timothy 1:16; 6:12 (eternal life — pattern and prize)
**1Ti 1:16:** Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
**1Ti 6:12:** Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.

### Titus 1:2; 3:7 (eternal life — promised before the world began; heirs)
**Tit 1:2:** In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
**Tit 3:7:** That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

*Note: Tit 1:2 contains TWO instances of G166: (1) "eternal life" (zoes aionion) and (2) "before the world began" (pro chronon aionion). The second instance is a past-time use — see Group C.*

### 1 John 1:2; 2:25; 3:15; 5:11,13,20 (eternal life — John's testimony)
**1Jn 1:2:** (For the life was manifested, and we have seen [it], and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)
**1Jn 2:25:** And this is the promise that he hath promised us, [even] eternal life.
**1Jn 3:15:** Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
**1Jn 5:11:** And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
**1Jn 5:13:** These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
**1Jn 5:20:** And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, [even] in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.

### Jude 1:21 (eternal life — looking for mercy)

### Mark 10:30 (eternal life — in the world/age to come)

*Note: "World to come" = aioni to erchomeno (G165). "Eternal life" = zoen aionion (G166). This verse places eternal life explicitly IN "the coming age," reinforcing that aionios = "pertaining to the [coming] age."*

### Luke 18:30 (life everlasting — in the world to come)
**Luk 18:30:** Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.

## Group B — Aionios + Negative Outcomes (Punishment/Fire/Destruction)

### Matthew 18:7-9 (everlasting fire — context of stumbling blocks)
**Mat 18:7:** Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
**Mat 18:8:** Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast [them] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
**Mat 18:9:** And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

*Greek text (Mat 18:8, key phrase):* εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ αἰώνιον — pyr (G4442, N-ASN) + aionion (G166, A-ASN): "into the fire, the eternal" (neuter gender, predicative position with article). Parsing: G166 A-ASN Acc Sg N.

### Matthew 25:41 (everlasting fire — prepared for the devil and his angels)
**Mat 25:41:** Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

*Full context (Mat 25:40-46):*
**Mat 25:40:** And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done [it] unto me.
**Mat 25:41:** Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
**Mat 25:42:** For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
**Mat 25:43:** I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
**Mat 25:44:** Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
**Mat 25:45:** Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it] not to me.
**Mat 25:46:** And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

*Greek text (Mat 25:41):* εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ αἰώνιον τὸ ἡτοιμασμένον τῷ διαβόλῳ καὶ τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ
- pyr (G4442, N-ASN) "fire"
- aionion (G166, A-ASN) "eternal" Acc Sg N
- hetoimasmenon (G2090, V-RPP-ASN) "having been prepared" — perfect passive participle
- diabolō (G1228, A-DSM) "devil" — DATIVE: the fire was prepared FOR the devil
*Critical observation: The fire was prepared for the devil and his angels. Human beings are cast into a fire whose primary recipients are named as the devil and his angels.*

### Matthew 25:46 (everlasting punishment — THE CRITICAL VERSE)
**Mat 25:46:** And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

*Greek text:* καὶ ἀπελεύσονται οὗτοι εἰς κόλασιν αἰώνιον, οἱ δὲ δίκαιοι εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον.
- kolasin (G2851, N-ASF) "punishment" — Acc Sg F
- aionion (G166, A-ASF) "eternal" — Acc Sg F — *IDENTICAL FORM*
- zoen (G2222, N-ASF) "life" — Acc Sg F
- aionion (G166, A-ASF) "eternal" — Acc Sg F — *IDENTICAL FORM*

*Note: Both nouns (kolasin and zoen) are Accusative Singular Feminine. Both adjectives (aionion) are Accusative Singular Feminine. The grammatical form is exactly parallel. This is the strongest argument for the symmetry claim that both outcomes must have the same kind of duration.*

*Note on kolasis (G2851): "penal infliction" — from kolazo (to prune/curtail). The word does not inherently specify conscious suffering. It appears only twice in the NT: Mat 25:46 and 1Jn 4:18 ("fear hath torment"). The Ezekiel 14:3 LXX use is also listed. The root meaning is "pruning/restraining punishment," not the same as basanizo (torment).*

### Mark 3:28-30 (eternal damnation/sin)
**Mrk 3:28:** Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:
**Mrk 3:29:** But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:
**Mrk 3:30:** Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

*Greek text (Mrk 3:29):* ἔνοχός ἐστιν αἰωνίου ἁμαρτήματος
- enochos (G1777) "in danger of / guilty of"
- aioniou (G166, A-GSF) "eternal" — Gen Sg F
- hamartematos (G265, N-GSN) "sin/offence" — Gen Sg N

*Note: The grammatical subject is not "eternal damnation" but "eternal sin" — the person is guilty of an eternal-category sin (blasphemy of the Holy Spirit). KJV "eternal damnation" is actually a textual variant — the N1904 text reads "eternal sin" (aioniou hamartematos), not "eternal judgment" (krima aionion). The verse does not use basanizo (torment) vocabulary.*

### 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10 (everlasting destruction)
**2Th 1:7:** And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
**2Th 1:8:** In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
**2Th 1:9:** Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
**2Th 1:10:** When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.

*Greek text (2Th 1:9):* ὄλεθρον αἰώνιον ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου
- olethron (G3639, N-ASM) "destruction/ruin" — Acc Sg M
- aionion (G166, A-ASM) "eternal" — Acc Sg M
- apo prosopou — "from the presence of" (separation phrase)

*Note: Paul chose olethros (ruin/destruction) rather than basanismos (torment). The phrase "from the presence of the Lord" is a separation phrase, not a location phrase — they are destroyed away from the Lord's presence.*

### Hebrews 6:1-3 (eternal judgment)
**Heb 6:1:** Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
**Heb 6:2:** Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
**Heb 6:3:** And this will we do, if God permit.

*Note: "Eternal judgment" (krimatos aioniou) = a judgment verdict that is permanent and unrevisable. The aionios here characterizes the finality of the verdict rendered, not the duration of an ongoing process. This is the "event-noun + aionios" pattern.*

### Jude 1:5-8 with 2 Peter 2:6 cross-reference (eternal fire applied to Sodom)
**Jude 1:5:** I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
**Jude 1:6:** And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
**Jude 1:7:** Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
**Jude 1:8:** Likewise also these [filthy] dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

**CROSS-REFERENCE — 2 Peter 2:6 (describing the same event):**
**2Pe 2:5:** And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person], a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
**2Pe 2:6:** And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
**2Pe 2:7:** And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:

*Greek text (Jude 1:7):* πρόκεινται δεῖγμα πυρὸς αἰωνίου δίκην ὑπέχουσαι
- puros (G4442, N-GSN) "fire" — Gen Sg N
- aioniou (G166, A-GSN) "eternal" — Gen Sg N
- deigma (G1164) "example/specimen"
- diken hupechousai — "undergoing [the] penalty/punishment"

*Critical observation (IB009-resolved from etc5-05, formerly N029, reclassified N→I-B): The fire that consumed Sodom is called "eternal fire" (puros aioniou). But 2Pet 2:6 says God "turned [Sodom] into ashes." The fire is eternal not because it still burns today, but because it produced a permanent, irreversible result. This is the clearest NT evidence that "eternal fire" = permanent result, not ongoing process.*

### Revelation 14:6-12 (everlasting gospel + eternal torment context)
**Rev 14:6:** And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
**Rev 14:7:** Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
**Rev 14:8:** And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
**Rev 14:9:** And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
**Rev 14:10:** The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
**Rev 14:11:** And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
**Rev 14:12:** Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

*Greek text (Rev 14:11):* καὶ ὁ καπνὸς τοῦ βασανισμοῦ αὐτῶν εἰς αἰῶνας αἰώνων ἀναβαίνει
- ho kapnos (G2586, N-NSM) "THE SMOKE" — Nominative Singular = grammatical subject
- basanismou (G929, N-GSM) "of the torment" — genitive
- aionas aionon (G165, N-APM + N-GPM) "ages of ages" = "for ever and ever"
- anabainei (G305, V-PAI-3S) "ascends" — present active indicative 3rd singular

*Critical observation: The grammatical subject of anabainei ("ascends") is "the smoke" (ho kapnos), not the people. The people (beast-worshippers) lack rest day and night. The smoke of their torment ascends = the desolation is permanent. This parallels Isa 34:10 (Isa 34:10: "It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever").*

*Note: "For ever and ever" = eis aionas aionon (literally "into ages of ages") — uses the PLURAL NOUN aion (G165), NOT the adjective aionios (G166).*

## Group C — Non-Eschatological Uses of Aionios

### Romans 16:25 (mystery kept secret since the world/ages began — PAST time reference)
**Rom 16:25:** Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,
**Rom 16:26:** But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:

*Greek text (Rom 16:25, key phrase):* χρόνοις αἰωνίοις σεσιγημένου
- chronois (G5550, N-DPM) "times/ages" — Dative Plural
- aioniois (G166, A-DPM) "eternal/age-long" — Dative Plural

*Note: This is a PAST-time use of aionios. The mystery was hidden "in eternal/age-long times" = during the ages past. Aionios here looks backward to ages already elapsed, not forward to endless future duration. The KJV translates it "since the world began."*

### 2 Timothy 1:9 (before the world/ages began — PAST time reference)
**2Ti 1:9:** Who hath saved us, and called [us] with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,

*Greek text (2Ti 1:9, key phrase):* πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων
- pro (G4253) "before"
- chronon (G5550, N-GPM) "times/ages" — Genitive Plural
- aionion (G166, A-GPM) "eternal/age-long" — Genitive Plural

*Note: Second PAST-time use. Grace was given "before age-long times" = before time began. The KJV translates "before the world began."*

### Titus 1:2 (before the world/ages began — PAST time reference)
**Tit 1:2:** In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;

*Greek text:* ἐπ' ἐλπίδι ζωῆς αἰωνίου ... πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων
*Note: This verse has BOTH uses: (1) "eternal life" (zoes aionion, looking forward) AND (2) "before age-long times" (pro chronon aionion, looking backward). The same adjective aionios modifies both a forward-looking and backward-looking temporal phrase IN THE SAME VERSE.*

### Philemon 1:15 (for ever — Onesimus returned permanently)
**Phm 1:13:** Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
**Phm 1:14:** But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
**Phm 1:15:** For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
**Phm 1:16:** Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?

*Greek text (Phm 1:15):* ἵνα αἰώνιον αὐτὸν ἀπέχῃς
- aionion (G166, A-ASM) "eternal/for ever" — Acc Sg M
- apecheis (G568, V-PAS-2S) "you might have/receive" — present active subjunctive

*Critical observation: Aionios here modifies Onesimus, a human being. The relationship between Philemon and Onesimus is bounded by their natural lifespans — neither will live forever. Yet Paul uses aionion to mean "permanently" or "for the rest of one's life." This is a NON-ESCHATOLOGICAL use where aionios does NOT mean endless.*

### 2 Corinthians 4:17-18 (eternal weight of glory — unseen things are eternal)
**2Co 4:17:** For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory;
**2Co 4:18:** While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal.

*Note: Contrast: proskaira (temporal/for a season) vs. aionios (eternal). Paul explicitly contrasts temporary things with aionion things.*

### 2 Corinthians 5:1 (eternal house in the heavens)
**2Co 5:1:** For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

### Hebrews 5:9 (eternal salvation — accomplished act)
**Heb 5:7:** Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;
**Heb 5:8:** Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
**Heb 5:9:** And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;

*Note: "Eternal salvation" = soterian aionion — an accomplished act whose results are permanent.*

### Hebrews 9:12 (eternal redemption — obtained once, ephapax)
**Heb 9:11:** But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
**Heb 9:12:** Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].

*Greek text (Heb 9:12):* εἰσῆλθεν ἐφάπαξ ... αἰωνίαν λύτρωσιν εὑράμενος
- eiselthen (G1525, V-2AAI-3S) "entered" — Aorist Active Indicative: completed action
- ephapax (G2178) "once for all" — adverb: single completed event
- aionion (G166, A-ASF) "eternal" — Acc Sg F
- lutrosin (G3085, N-ASF) "redemption" — event noun (process of redeeming)
- heuramenos (G2147, V-2AMP-NSM) "having obtained" — Aorist Middle Participle: completed act

*Critical observation: The event-noun pattern. Lutrosin (redemption) = a completed act. Aionios modifies the EVENT-NOUN, not an ongoing process. "Eternal redemption" = the redemption that was accomplished once-for-all and whose results are permanent. Compare: "eternal judgment" (Heb 6:2), "eternal salvation" (Heb 5:9), "eternal Spirit" (Heb 9:14), "eternal inheritance" (Heb 9:15), "eternal covenant" (Heb 13:20). All are aionios + an event-noun or a result-noun. The aionios characterizes the permanence of the result, not the duration of an ongoing process.*

### Hebrews 9:14-15 (eternal Spirit; eternal inheritance)
**Heb 9:14:** How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
**Heb 9:15:** And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

### Hebrews 13:20 (everlasting covenant)
**Heb 13:20:** Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
**Heb 13:21:** Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.

## Group D — Aion (G165) as Explicit Age-Marker

### Matthew 12:32 ("this age" and "the age to come")
**Mat 12:31:** Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy [against] the [Holy] Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.
**Mat 12:32:** And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the [world] to come.

*Greek: "this world" = toutō tō aiōni; "the world to come" = tō mellonti — aion (G165) = "age." The same noun root that gives aionios its meaning.*

### Matthew 13:39,40,49 ("end of the world/age")
**Mat 13:39:** The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
**Mat 13:40:** As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
**Mat 13:49:** So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,

*Greek: "end of the world" = synteleia tou aionos — "completion/end of the age." The aion has an END. This demonstrates that aion/aionios is AGE-bounded, not inherently endless.*

### Matthew 24:3 ("end of the world" — disciples' question)
**Mat 24:3:** And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what [shall be] the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?

### Matthew 28:20 ("end of the world" — Great Commission)
**Mat 28:20:** Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, [even] unto the end of the world. Amen.

*Greek: "end of the world" = synteleia tou aionos. Christ promises to be with his disciples until the END of the age — the age ENDS.*

### Luke 20:35 ("that world" — the resurrection age)
**Luk 20:34:** And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
**Luk 20:35:** But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:

*Greek: "that world" = tou aionos ekeinou — "that age." The coming resurrection age is "that age."*

### Luke 18:30 ("world to come" — life everlasting)
**Luk 18:30:** Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.

### Hebrews 1:2 (worlds/ages made by the Son)
**Heb 1:2:** Hath in these last days spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;

*Greek: "worlds" = tous aionas — plural of aion: "the ages."*

### Hebrews 11:3 (worlds framed by the word of God)
**Heb 11:3:** Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.

*Greek: "worlds" = tous aionas — the ages were framed/constituted.*

### Ephesians 3:11 (eternal purpose)
**Eph 3:9:** And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
**Eph 3:11:** According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:

*Greek: "eternal purpose" = prothesis ton aionon — literally "purpose of the ages." KJV translates as "eternal purpose." Note: this uses aionon (genitive plural of aion, G165), NOT the adjective aionios (G166). Even "eternal" in the sense of "transcending all ages" is expressed via the plural noun here.*

### Colossians 1:26 (mystery hid from ages/aions)
**Col 1:26:** [Even] the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:

*Greek: "from ages" = apo ton aionon — "from the ages" (genitive plural). The mystery was hidden during the succession of ages.*

### 1 Corinthians 2:7 (wisdom ordained before the world)
**1Co 2:7:** But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom], which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

*Greek: "before the world" = pro ton aionon — "before the ages."*

### "For Ever and Ever" = eis tous aionas ton aionon (all key instances)

**Revelation 14:11** (smoke of torment — smoke is grammatical subject):
> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

*Greek: eis aionas aionon anabainei — ho kapnos (THE SMOKE) is the nominative subject of anabainei. The smoke of the torment ascends into ages of ages. This is the FIRST of three judgment "for ever and ever" instances.*

**Revelation 19:3** (Babylon's smoke):
> And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.

*Greek: ho kapnos autes anabainei eis tous aionas ton aionon — "her smoke ascends into the ages of the ages." Subject = SMOKE. The OT background is Isa 34:10 (Edom's desolation: smoke goes up forever). Edom is not still burning; the desolation is permanent.*

**Revelation 20:10** (devil, beast, false prophet — NAMED SUBJECTS):
> And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

*Greek text:* βασανισθήσονται ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων
- basanisthesontai (G928, V-FPI-3P) "shall be tormented" — Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural
- Subject: "the devil ... and the beast and the false prophet" — named supernatural/symbolic entities
- eis tous aionas ton aionon — "into the ages of the ages"

*Critical observation: Rev 20:10 names three specific subjects: the devil, the beast, and the false prophet — the primary agents of the Tribulation. The generic human wicked (Rev 20:15) are described as being "cast into the lake of fire" without the "for ever and ever" torment language.*

**Additional "for ever and ever" instances applied to God/Christ:**
- 1Ti 1:17: "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever."
- Heb 13:21: "to whom [be] glory for ever and ever"
- Rev 1:6; 4:9,10; 5:13,14; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 15:7; 22:5 — applied to God, Christ, and the redeemed reign

## Aidios (G126) Comparison Passages

### Romans 1:18-21 (aidios — God's eternal power and Godhead)
**Rom 1:18:** For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
**Rom 1:19:** Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed [it] unto them.
**Rom 1:20:** For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
**Rom 1:21:** Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

*Greek text (Rom 1:20):* ἥ τε ἀΐδιος αὐτοῦ δύναμις καὶ θειότης
- aidios (G126, A-NSF) "everduring" — Nom Sg F
- dunamis (G1411, N-NSF) "power" — Nom Sg F
- theiotēs (G2305, N-NSF) "Godhead/divinity" — Nom Sg F

*Critical observation: Paul chose aidios (G126, from aei = "always/continually") — NOT aionios (G166, from aion = "age") — to describe God's INTRINSIC power. Aidios means "everduring (forward and backward, or forward)" by definition. If aionios inherently meant "endless," Paul would have had no reason to use the rarer aidios here. The word choice in Romans 1:20 is the strongest grammatical evidence that aionios and aidios carry different semantic content.*

### Jude 1:6 (aidios — everlasting chains of fallen angels)
**Jude 1:5:** I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
**Jude 1:6:** And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
**Jude 1:7:** Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

*Greek text (Jude 1:6):* δεσμοῖς ἀϊδίοις ὑπὸ ζόφον τετήρηκεν
- desmois (G1199, N-DPM) "chains" — Dat Pl M
- aidiois (G126, A-DPM) "everlasting" — Dat Pl M
- teterekën (G5083, V-RAI-3S) "hath reserved" — Perfect Active Indicative

*Critical observation: Jude uses aidios (G126) for the fallen angels' chains — the STRONGER word meaning genuinely "everduring." Immediately in the next verse (Jude 1:7), Jude uses aionios (G166) for Sodom's "eternal fire" — which 2Pet 2:6 shows produced ashes. Jude uses BOTH words in adjacent verses, demonstrating he treats them as distinct. The aidios chains are the current, ongoing holding of the angels. The aionios fire of Sodom is the completed, permanent judgment.*

## ECT (Endless Conscious Torment) Key Passages

### Revelation 14:9-11 (full passage)
*(Text given above under Group B, Rev 14:6-12)*

### Revelation 20:9-15 (full context for Rev 20:10)
**Rev 20:9:** And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
**Rev 20:10:** And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
**Rev 20:11:** And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
**Rev 20:12:** And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
**Rev 20:13:** And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
**Rev 20:14:** And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
**Rev 20:15:** And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

*Critical subject differentiation:*
- Rev 20:9: Human armies "devoured" (katephagen, G2719) — DESTRUCTION vocabulary
- Rev 20:10: Devil, beast, false prophet — TORMENT (basanisthesontai) for ever and ever — NAMED SUPERNATURAL/SYMBOLIC SUBJECTS
- Rev 20:14: Lake of fire = "the second death" — DEATH vocabulary for the lake itself
- Rev 20:15: Generic human wicked cast into lake of fire — NO "for ever and ever" torment language applied to them specifically

## Additional Context Passages

### Mark 10:30 (in the world/age to come eternal life)
*(Given above under Group A)*

### Luke 18:30 (world to come — life everlasting)
*(Given above under Group D)*

### Luke 20:34-36 (children of this world / that world)
*(Given above under Group D)*

### Isaiah 34:10 (OT background for Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3)
*Note: Isa 34:10 was confirmed as the highest-scoring OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (hybrid score 0.401) and appears under PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL in Nave's. Full text is in the OT, but the parallel is:*
> "It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever." (Isa 34:10)
*This is a description of the desolation of Edom — the land became a permanent wasteland. "Smoke goes up for ever" = permanent desolation, not an ongoing fire still burning today. Rev 14:11 and 19:3 use the same smoke-ascending formula for the same type of permanent judgment.*

### Revelation 19:1-4 (Babylon's smoke — "for ever and ever")
**Rev 19:1:** And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
**Rev 19:2:** For true and righteous [are] his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
**Rev 19:3:** And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
**Rev 19:4:** And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.

*Note: Rev 19:3 "her smoke rose up for ever and ever" — Babylon's smoke, not Babylon's people. The grammatical subject is smoke (kapnos). Compare Isa 34:10.*
