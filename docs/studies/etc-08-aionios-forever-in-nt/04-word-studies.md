### Hebrew Source (LXX mapping)
Primary Hebrew equivalents that aionios translates in the LXX:
1. **H5769: olam** -- count: 100, PMI: 5.67, score: 26.16 -- "concealed, i.e. the vanishing point; time out of mind (past or future)"
2. **H1755: dor** -- count: 23, PMI: 5.20, score: 16.51 -- "a generation; a dwelling"
3. **H2708: chuqqah** -- count: 20, PMI: 5.35, score: 16.30 -- "an enactment; a statute"
4. **H2706: choq** -- count: 14, PMI: 4.54, score: 12.29 -- "an enactment; an appointment"
5. **H1285: berith** -- count: 20, PMI: 3.97, score: 12.08 -- "a compact, covenant"
6. **H7985: sholtan** -- count: 4, PMI: 6.49, score: 10.45 -- "empire, dominion"
7. **H5957: alam** -- count: 4, PMI: 5.75, score: 9.26 -- "remote time (Aramaic)"

**Critical finding:** The primary Hebrew source is olam (H5769), which in the OT demonstrably refers to limited durations in many contexts (Exod 21:6 slave "forever" = lifetime; Jonah 2:6 "forever" = three days; 1 Sam 2:30 "forever" revoked by God). This means aionios inherits the semantic range of olam.

### Hebrew Source (LXX mapping)
1. **H5769: olam** -- count: 287, PMI: 5.55, score: 31.41 -- "concealed; time out of mind"
2. **H5703: ad** -- count: 33, PMI: 5.57, score: 19.64 -- "a terminus; perpetuity"

### Semantic Range
The noun aion has a broader semantic range than most English translations suggest:
- **"Age" (temporal period):** Matt 12:32; 13:22,39,40,49; 24:3; 28:20; Lk 20:34-35; Rom 12:2; 1 Cor 1:20; 2:6-8; 2 Cor 4:4; Eph 2:2,7; 3:9
- **"World" (as temporal location):** Heb 1:2; 9:26; 11:3 -- the created temporal order
- **"Ever/evermore" (duration formula):** Most doxological passages, the "ages of ages" construction
- **"Ages" (plural):** Eph 2:7; 3:9 -- multiple ages, distinct periods
- **Key insight:** When used in the formula "this age" vs "the age to come," aion clearly means a bounded temporal period, and this is the root word from which aionios is formed

## G126: aidios (adjective)

### Lexical Data
- **Greek:** aidios
- **Transliteration:** aidios
- **Pronunciation:** ah-id-ee-os
- **Part of speech:** adjective
- **BLB Count:** 2 occurrences
- **Definition:** From G104 (aei, "always"); everduring (forward and backward, or forward only)
- **Derivation:** From aei (G104, "always/ever") -- NOT from aion (G165)

### KJV Translation Distribution
| Translation | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| eternal | 1 | 50% |
| in everlasting | 1 | 50% |

### Occurrences
1. **Romans 1:20** -- "his **eternal** power and Godhead" (applied to God)
2. **Jude 1:6** -- "**everlasting** chains under darkness" (applied to angelic imprisonment)

### No Hebrew Source Found
The LXX mapping tool found no Hebrew source words for aidios. This is a distinctly Greek word with no direct Hebrew equivalent, derived from the Greek concept of "always" (aei), not from the Hebrew concept of olam.

### Comparison: Aidios vs. Aionios
| Feature | Aidios (G126) | Aionios (G166) |
|---|---|---|
| Root | aei (G104, "always") | aion (G165, "age") |
| Inherent meaning | "always-existing, everduring" | "pertaining to an age" |
| Occurrences | 2 | 71 |
| Applied to God | Yes (Rom 1:20) | Yes (Rom 16:26, etc.) |
| Applied to life | No | Yes (42+ times) |
| Applied to punishment | No directly (chains, not the punishment itself) | Yes (7 times) |
| Applied to past time | No | Yes (3 times) |
| Hebrew source | None (purely Greek) | H5769 olam (primarily) |

**Critical observation:** If Greek had only one word for "eternal/endless," we would expect that word to be used consistently. The existence of aidios (inherently meaning "ever-existing") alongside aionios (meaning "age-related") suggests the NT authors had a choice and deliberately chose aionios (the age-related word) for most purposes, using aidios only twice.

## H5769: olam (Hebrew -- background for aionios)

### Relevance
The primary Hebrew word that both aion (G165) and aionios (G166) translate in the LXX. The semantic range of olam directly informs how aionios would have been understood by readers steeped in the Hebrew scriptures.

### Key OT Examples of Limited Duration
1. **Exodus 21:6** -- A slave serves "le-olam" (forever) = until death
2. **Jonah 2:6** -- "The earth with her bars was about me le-olam" = three days
3. **1 Samuel 2:30** -- God said the priestly house would serve "le-olam" but then revoked it
4. **Jer 18:16** -- Desolation "le-olam" of cities that were later rebuilt
5. **Hab 3:6** -- The "olam" mountains were scattered -- they are temporal

### OT Examples of Truly Endless Duration
1. **Psa 90:2** -- "From everlasting to everlasting, thou art God"
2. **Dan 12:2** -- "Everlasting life... everlasting contempt"
3. **Gen 3:22** -- "Live le-olam" with tree of life access

### Conclusion on Olam's Semantic Range
Olam's duration is determined by the nature of the subject, not by the word itself. When applied to God (who is by nature endless), it means truly endless. When applied to a slave's service, it means a lifetime. This inherited semantic flexibility is critical for understanding aionios.

## Related Key Terms

### G2222: zoe (life)
The word consistently paired with aionios in the phrase "zoe aionios" (eternal/everlasting life). Occurs 42+ times in this pairing, making "aionios life" the most common use of aionios by far.

### G2851: kolasis (punishment/pruning)
Used in Matt 25:46 -- "kolasis aionios." Kolasis originally meant "pruning" or "corrective punishment" (vs. timoria, "retributive punishment"). Some scholars argue this term itself suggests remedial rather than purely retributive punishment.

### G3639: olethros (destruction/ruin)
Used in 2 Thess 1:9 -- "olethros aionios." The word means ruin, destruction. Combined with aionios, the question is whether this means "destruction that is age-lasting" or "destruction that is eternal."

### G4442: pur (fire)
Used with aionios in Matt 18:8; 25:41; Jude 1:7. The "aionios fire" of Jude 1:7 is applied to Sodom, whose fire demonstrably went out, raising the question of whether aionios describes the fire's duration or its source/quality.
