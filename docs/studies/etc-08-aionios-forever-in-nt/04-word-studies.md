## Question
What does the Greek word aionios (G166) mean in the New Testament?

---

## 1. G166 — αἰώνιος (aionios) — THE CORE WORD UNDER STUDY

**Original:** αἰώνιος
**Transliteration:** aiōnios
**Pronunciation:** ahee-o-nee-os
**Part of Speech:** adjective (adj)
**BLB Count:** 71 occurrences
**KJV Count:** 48 occurrences, 12 unique translations

**Strong's Definition:**
"perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well)" — from G165 (aiōn)

**Key element of definition:** The definition EXPLICITLY states "also used of past time, or past and future as well." This is a lexicographically-confirmed bidirectional semantic range. The word is not simply "forward-looking endless."

**BLB Outline of Biblical Usage (per lexicon):**
Includes references from: Numbers 25:13 (LXX); Ecclesiastes 12:5 (LXX); Matthew 25:41; 25:46; Mark 3:29; 16; Luke 16:9; John 14:2; Romans 16:25; 16:26; 2 Corinthians 4:17; 4:18; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; 2:16; 2:16; 2 Timothy 1:9; 2:10; Titus 1:2; Philemon 1:15; Hebrews 5:9; 6:2; 9:12; 9:12; 9:12; 9:14; 9:15; 1 Peter 5:10; 2 Peter 1:11; Revelation 14:6

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| "eternal" | 19 | 39.6% |
| "everlasting" | 13 | 27.1% |
| "of eternal" | 7 | 14.6% |
| "of everlasting" | 1 | 2.1% |
| "since the world began" | 1 | 2.1% |
| "with everlasting" | 1 | 2.1% |
| "the world began" | 1 | 2.1% |
| "the world" | 1 | 2.1% |
| "for ever" | 1 | 2.1% |
| "the eternal" | 1 | 2.1% |
| "of the everlasting" | 1 | 2.1% |
| "the everlasting" | 1 | 2.1% |

**Critical translation data:**
- "since the world began" — Rom 16:25 (PAST-time reference: chronois aioniois)
- "for ever" — Phm 1:15 (human relationship: aionion modifying Onesimus)

**Morphological analysis:**
Aionios = aion (G165, "age") + -ios (Greek adjectival suffix meaning "pertaining to" or "characteristic of"). The morphology means "age-pertaining" or "age-characterized." Compare: ouranios (heavenly, from ouranos = heaven), ephemerios (daily, from ephemera = day). This is NOT an alpha-privative word (like athanasia = "un-death-ness"). Aionios does not morphologically mean "un-ending."

**Subject-categorized distribution of 71 BLB occurrences:**
- ~23 with "life" (zoe aionios) — Group A
- ~7 with negative judgment terms (fire, punishment, destruction, damnation, judgment) — Group B
- ~3 past-time references (chronois aioniois) — Group C
- ~1 human relationship (Phm 1:15) — Group C
- Remaining: Spirit (Heb 9:14), covenant (Heb 13:20), gospel (Rev 14:6), glory (2Co 4:17; 1Pet 5:10), consolation (2Th 2:16), habitations (Luk 16:9), salvation (Heb 5:9), redemption (Heb 9:12), inheritance (Heb 9:15), purpose (Eph 3:11 — note: this uses the noun form, not the adjective), king (1Ti 1:17)

**LXX Bridge Data (Hebrew sources):**
| Hebrew | Count | PMI | Score | Definition |
|--------|-------|-----|-------|-----------|
| H5769 (olam) | 100 | 5.67 | 26.16 | "concealed, time out of mind" — primary source |
| H1755 (dor) | 23 | 5.20 | 16.51 | "generation" |
| H2708 (chuqqah) | 20 | 5.35 | 16.30 | "statute/ordinance" |
| H2706 (choq) | 14 | 4.54 | 12.29 | "appointment/enactment" |
| H1285 (berith) | 20 | 3.97 | 12.08 | "covenant" |
| H5957 (alam, Aramaic) | 4 | 5.75 | 9.26 | "remote time" |

**Primary finding:** H5769 (olam) → G166 (aionios): 100 occurrences, PMI 5.67 = highest PMI score of all Hebrew sources. This confirms that the LXX translators systematically chose aionios to render olam. Since N034 (from etc5-07) established that olam's duration is contextually determined by the nature of the referent (not the word itself), and N035 established that G166 inherits olam's semantic range, the same principle applies: aionios's duration is contextually determined by the nature of the referent.

## 2. G165 — αἰών (aiōn) — THE ROOT NOUN

**Original:** αἰών
**Transliteration:** aiōn
**Pronunciation:** ahee-ohn
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 128 occurrences
**KJV Count:** 109 occurrences, 14 unique translations

**Strong's Definition:**
"properly, an age; by extension, perpetuity (also past time)" — from the same as [implied root]

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| "ever" | 42 | 38.5% |
| "world" | 30 | 27.5% |
| "and ever" | 20 | 18.3% |
| "evermore" | 3 | 2.8% |
| "the world began" | 2 | 1.8% |
| "ages" | 2 | 1.8% |
| "eternal" | 2 | 1.8% |
| "worlds" | 2 | 1.8% |
| "the beginning of the world" | 1 | 0.9% |
| "while the world standeth" | 1 | 0.9% |
| "course" | 1 | 0.9% |
| "beginning of the world" | 1 | 0.9% |
| "without end" | 1 | 0.9% |
| "of the world" | 1 | 0.9% |

**Key observations:**
1. "World" = 30x (27.5%): Demonstrates that aion means "AGE/ERA" — translators used "world" to convey the idea of an age/era of history
2. "Ages" and "worlds" (plural): The word IS used in the plural — something that would be odd if it meant simply "eternity"
3. "Course" (1x): Eph 2:2 — "the course of this world" = kata ton aiona tou kosmou
4. "Without end" (1x): Eph 3:21 — "throughout all ages, world without end" = eis pasas tas geneas tou aionos ton aionon

**"For ever and ever" = eis tous aionas ton aionon:**
This phrase uses G165 (the PLURAL NOUN aion), NOT G166 (the adjective aionios). It is literally "into the ages of the ages." The formula appears ~20 times:
- Applied to God/Christ: Gal 1:5; 1Ti 1:17; Heb 1:8; 13:21; 1Pe 4:11; Rev 1:6; 4:9,10; 5:13,14; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 15:7; 22:5
- Applied to judgment subjects: Rev 14:11 (smoke); Rev 19:3 (Babylon's smoke); Rev 20:10 (devil/beast/false prophet)

**Key "age" passages (showing G165 explicitly as "age/era"):**
- "This age" (ho aion houtos): Mat 12:32; 13:22; Luk 16:8; 1Co 2:6,8; 2Co 4:4; Gal 1:4
- "The age to come" (ho aion ho erchomenos): Mat 12:32; Mrk 10:30; Luk 18:30; 20:35
- "End of the age" (synteleia tou aionos): Mat 13:39,40,49; 24:3; 28:20
- "The ages" (plural hoi aiones): Heb 1:2; 11:3; Eph 3:11; Col 1:26; 1Co 2:7
- "This present evil age" (aion ponēros): Gal 1:4
- "The god of this age": 2Co 4:4

## 3. G126 — ἀΐδιος (aidios) — THE CRITICAL COMPARISON WORD

**Original:** ἀΐδιος
**Transliteration:** aidios (note: NOT aionios — distinct word)
**Pronunciation:** ah-id-ee-os
**Part of Speech:** adjective (adj)
**BLB Count:** 2 occurrences (total NT occurrences)
**Root:** From G104 (aei = "always/continually")

**Strong's Definition:**
"everduring (forward and backward, or forward)" — from G104 (aei)

**Key elements of definition:**
1. "everduring" — inherently without end
2. "forward and backward, or forward" — can mean eternal in both directions, or just eternally forward
3. Root from aei (G104) = "always/continually" — genuine uninterrupted permanence

**Complete NT occurrences (only 2):**

**Romans 1:20** — aidios applied to God's power:
> "his eternal [aidios] power and Godhead"
*Greek: aidios (G126, A-NSF) — Nom Sg F modifying dunamis*

**Jude 1:6** — aidios applied to fallen angels' chains:
> "everlasting [aidios] chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day"
*Greek: aidiois (G126, A-DPM) — Dat Pl M modifying desmois*

**The aidios vs. aionios argument:**

Paul had BOTH words available. In the same epistle (Romans), he uses:
- aionios (G166) for "eternal life" (Rom 2:7; 5:21; 6:22,23)
- aidios (G126) for God's "eternal power" (Rom 1:20)

If aionios meant "genuinely endless," Paul would have had no reason to switch to the rarer aidios for Rom 1:20. The fact that he chose aidios — the word explicitly defined as "everduring" and derived from aei ("always") — for God's intrinsic attribute demonstrates that aionios did NOT carry the same inherent endlessness.

Similarly, Jude uses aidios for the angels' chains (ongoing, not yet terminated) but aionios for Sodom's fire (completed, leaving ashes). Jude uses both words in adjacent verses, demonstrating he regards them as semantically distinct.

**G104 — aei root:**
Definition: "from an obsolete primary noun (apparently meaning continued duration)"
Occurrences: Mrk 15:8; Act 7:51; 2Co 4:11; 6:10; Tit 1:12; Heb 3:10; 1Pe 3:15; 2Pe 1:12
KJV: "always" (7x), "ever" (1x)

## 4. G2851 — κόλασις (kolasis) — "PUNISHMENT" in Matthew 25:46

**Original:** κόλασις
**Transliteration:** kolasis
**Pronunciation:** kol-as-is
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**BLB Count:** 2 (NT) + LXX uses

**Strong's Definition:**
"penal infliction" — from kolazo (G2849), to lop, prune, curtail

**Outline of Biblical Usage (BLB):**
Ezekiel 14:3 (LXX); Matthew 25:46; 1 John 4:18

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
- "punishment" (1x — Mat 25:46)

**Root analysis:**
Kolasis derives from kolazo (G2849), which primarily means "to lop, prune, curtail" — the image is of pruning/cutting off, not of prolonged conscious suffering. The word denotes penal infliction as a category, not specifically the mode or duration.

**Key comparison:**
- Mat 25:46: kolasin aionion = "everlasting punishment" — the word describing punishment is NOT basanismo (torment)
- 1Jn 4:18: "fear hath torment" — KJV uses "torment" but the Greek is kolasis — even the KJV is inconsistent
- LXX: Ezk 14:3 — kolasis used for idols as "stumbling blocks of punishment"

**Critical observation:**
The word in the most important eschatological didactic passage (Mat 25:46) is KOLASIS (punishment), not BASANISMOS (torment). Paul in 2Th 1:9 uses OLETHROS (destruction). Neither of the key apostolic passages on the fate of the wicked (one from Jesus, one from Paul) uses the torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos). That vocabulary is confined to Revelation's symbolic visions.

## 5. G3639 — ὄλεθρος (olethros) — "DESTRUCTION" (2 Thessalonians 1:9)

**Original:** ὄλεθρος
**Transliteration:** olethros
**Pronunciation:** ol-eth-ros
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 4

**Strong's Definition:**
"ruin, i.e. death, punishment" — from a primary ollymi (to destroy; a prolonged form)

**Outline of Biblical Usage (BLB):**
2 Thessalonians 1:9 (eschatological context)

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
- "destruction" (3x, 75%)
- "the destruction" (1x, 25%)

**NT occurrences:**
1. 1Co 5:5: "for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved"
2. 1Th 5:3: "then sudden destruction (olethros) cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child"
3. 2Th 1:9: "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction (olethron aionion)"
4. 1Ti 6:9: "which drown men in destruction (olethron)"

**Key analysis for 2Th 1:9:**
Greek: ὄλεθρον αἰώνιον ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου
- olethron (G3639, N-ASM) "destruction/ruin" — the chosen noun is RUIN, not torment
- aionion (G166, A-ASM) "eternal" — modifies the noun
- apo prosopou — "from the presence of" — separation language

Paul's word choice is deliberate: olethros = ruin/destruction, not basanismos = torment. The "from the presence of the Lord" phrase is a separation/expulsion formula, echoing Isa 2:19-21 (people hiding from the Lord's presence) rather than a location phrase meaning they are near him while suffering.

## 6. G928 — βασανίζω (basanizō) — "TO TORMENT"

**Original:** βασανίζω
**Transliteration:** basanizō
**Pronunciation:** bas-an-id-zo
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**BLB Count:** 12

**Strong's Definition:**
"to torture" — pain, toil, torment, toss, vex

**BLB All NT Occurrences:**
Mat 8:6 (servant "grievously tormented"); Mat 8:29 ("art thou come to torment us?"); Mat 14:24 ("ship tossed with waves"); Mrk 5:7 ("I adjure thee... torment me not"); Mrk 6:48 ("he saw them toiling in rowing"); Luk 8:28 ("I beseech thee, torment me not"); 2Pe 2:8 ("vexed his righteous soul"); Rev 9:5 ("should be tormented"); Rev 11:10 ("tormented them that dwell on the earth"); Rev 12:2 ("travailing in birth, and pained"); Rev 14:10 ("he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone"); Rev 20:10 ("shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever")

**Eschatological distribution:**
- Non-eschatological: Mat 8:6 (sickness); Mat 14:24 (waves); Mrk 6:48 (rowing); Rev 12:2 (birth pains); 2Pe 2:8 (vexation)
- Demonic/spiritual: Mat 8:29 (demon fear); Mrk 5:7 (demon); Luk 8:28 (demon)
- Eschatological Revelation passages ONLY: Rev 9:5; 11:10; 14:10; 20:10

**Critical observation (confirming N033):**
Basanizo appears 12 times. ALL eschatological judgment uses (torment specifically, not metaphorical) are IN REVELATION — the symbolic/apocalyptic vision book. The word never appears with destruction vocabulary (apollumi, olethros, apoleia) for the same subject in the same judgment context. There is no NT passage that says both "destroyed/perished" AND "tormented" of the same human subject at the same eschatological event.

## 7. G929 — βασανισμός (basanismos) — "TORMENT" (noun)

**Original:** βασανισμός
**Transliteration:** basanismos
**Pronunciation:** bas-an-is-mos
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun (n-m)
**BLB Count:** 6 (ALL in Revelation)

**Strong's Definition:**
"torture" — from basanizo (G928)

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
- "torment" (5x, 83.3%)
- "the torment" (1x, 16.7%)

**COMPLETE NT OCCURRENCES (all 6):**
1. Rev 9:5: "their torment was as the torment of a scorpion" (locust torment)
2. Rev 14:11: "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever"
3. Rev 18:7: "so much torment and sorrow give her" (Babylon)
4. Rev 18:10: "alas, alas, that great city Babylon... for in one hour is thy judgment come" — torment language
5. Rev 18:15: "shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment"

**Critical observation (confirming E172):**
G929 (basanismos) occurs ZERO TIMES outside of Revelation in the NT. Every use of this noun is in the symbolic/apocalyptic vision book. This is the word used in Rev 14:11 ("smoke of their torment"). The TORMENT vocabulary — both verb (G928) and noun (G929) — is lexically confined to Revelation in eschatological contexts. The didactic epistles (Paul's letters, John's letters) do not use this vocabulary for the fate of the wicked.

## 8. G622 — ἀπόλλυμι (apollumi) — "TO DESTROY/PERISH"

**Original:** ἀπόλλυμι
**Transliteration:** apollumi
**Pronunciation:** ap-ol-loo-mee
**Part of Speech:** verb (v)
**BLB Count:** 92

**Strong's Definition:**
"to destroy fully (reflexively, to perish, or lose)" — from apo + the base of olethros

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
- "perish" (10x, 11.9%)
- "to destroy" (7x, 8.3%)
- "shall lose" (7x, 8.3%)
- "destroy" (5x, 6.0%)
- Various other loss/destruction renderings

**Key eschatological uses:**
- Jhn 3:16: "should not PERISH, but have everlasting life" — structural antithesis to eternal life
- Jhn 3:15: "should not perish" — paired with eternal life
- Jhn 10:28: "they shall never PERISH" — paired with eternal life
- Mat 10:28: "able to DESTROY (apollesai) both soul and body in hell" — God's ability to destroy completely
- Jhn 17:12: "none of them is LOST" (apolleto)

**Critical observation:**
In John's Gospel, apollumi (perish/destroy) is the explicit ANTITHESIS of eternal life. Jhn 3:16: "should not PERISH but have EVERLASTING LIFE." The contrast is not "endless torment vs. endless life" but "perishing/destruction vs. life." This structural pairing is consistent with conditionalist readings.

## 9. G2222 — ζωή (zōē) — "LIFE"

**Original:** ζωή
**Transliteration:** zōē
**Pronunciation:** dzo-ay
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun (n-f)
**BLB Count:** 134

**Strong's Definition:**
"life (literally or figuratively)" — from zao (to live)

**KJV Translation Distribution:**
- "life" (54x, 67.5%)
- "of life" (24x, 30.0%)
- "lifetime" (1x, 1.2%)
- "of the life" (1x, 1.2%)

**Zoe aionios = "eternal life" occurrences:**
Zoe (G2222) + aionios (G166) appears approximately 23-24 times in the NT. Key instances:
- Mat 19:16,29; 25:46
- Jhn 3:15,16,36; 4:14,36; 5:24,39; 6:27,40,47,54,68; 10:28; 12:25,50; 17:2,3
- Acts 13:46,48
- Rom 2:7; 5:21; 6:22,23
- Gal 6:8; 1Ti 1:16; 6:12; Tit 1:2; 3:7
- 1Jn 1:2; 2:25; 3:15; 5:11,13,20
- Jude 1:21

**Key observation for Mat 25:46 analysis:**
In Mat 25:46, zoen aionion (life eternal) and kolasin aionion (punishment eternal) are grammatically parallel — same adjective (aionion, Acc Sg F), same case. The symmetry argument holds that if life is endless, punishment must be endless with equal certainty. The response to this is that aionios modifies BOTH with the same adjective, but the SUBJECT determines the actual duration — life in God is genuinely endless because God is endless; punishment is permanent/irrevocable because the divine verdict is final.

## Summary Table: Fate-of-the-Wicked Vocabulary

| Word | Strong's | Used in didactic epistles? | Used in Revelation? | What it means |
|------|---------|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| aionios (eternal) | G166 | Yes — 2Th 1:9 (destruction); Heb 6:2 (judgment) | Yes — Rev 14:6 (gospel) | "age-pertaining, permanent" — subject determines duration |
| olethros (destruction/ruin) | G3639 | Yes — 1Co 5:5; 1Th 5:3; 2Th 1:9; 1Ti 6:9 | No | Ruin/destruction — Paul's chosen eschatological noun |
| kolasis (punishment) | G2851 | Yes — Mat 25:46 | No | Penal infliction — from "to prune/curtail" |
| basanizo (torment, verb) | G928 | No (eschatological use) | Yes — Rev 14:10; 20:10 | Torture/torment — eschatological use confined to Revelation |
| basanismos (torment, noun) | G929 | NO — never outside Revelation | Yes — Rev 14:11; 18:7,10,15 | Torment — EXCLUSIVE to Revelation |
| apollumi (perish/destroy) | G622 | Yes — widespread | Yes | Destruction/perishing — explicit antithesis to "eternal life" |
| aidios (everduring) | G126 | Yes — Rom 1:20; Jude 1:6 | No | Genuinely endless — from aei ("always") |

**The distribution pattern:**
- The torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos) is lexically confined to Revelation
- The destruction vocabulary (olethros, apollumi) is widespread in the didactic epistles
- The didactic epistles (Paul, John, James, Peter) consistently use destruction/perishing language, not torment language, for the fate of the wicked
- Revelation's torment language applies to: (a) named supernatural/symbolic entities — devil, beast, false prophet (Rev 20:10); (b) a specific class — beast-worshippers of the Tribulation (Rev 14:10-11); the torment vocabulary is never generalized to all human wicked in the didactic manner

**The LXX confirmation:**
G929 (basanismos) was established by E171 (from etc5-06) to NEVER appear in the LXX as a translation of any Hebrew destruction term. The Hebrew destruction vocabulary (abad, shachar, kalah, shachath) is never rendered by basanizo/basanismos in the LXX. The torment vocabulary has no OT destruction precedent — it is a new Revelation-specific symbolic element.
