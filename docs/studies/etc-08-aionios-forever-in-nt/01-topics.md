## Question

What does the Greek word aionios (G166) mean in the New Testament? Does it always mean "eternal/endless" or can it mean "age-long/pertaining to an age"? Examine all 71 NT occurrences of aionios: in "eternal life," "eternal punishment," "eternal fire," "eternal destruction," and other contexts. Does the semantic range of aionios in the NT require endless conscious torment for the wicked? How does aionios compare to the rarer adjective aidios (G126), which explicitly carries the meaning "everduring (forward and backward)"? And what does the phrase "for ever and ever" (eis tous aionas ton aionon) — literally "into the ages of the ages" — mean in the 20 NT passages where it appears, especially in Revelation?

*Note: The IMMORTALITY entry in Nave's is a general-purpose cluster covering both positive outcomes (eternal life, resurrection) and negative outcomes (2Th 1:7-9 appears in this list). This confirms that the traditional topical approach does not sharply separate the two poles — both life and judgment appear under the single rubric of "immortality."*

### ETERNITY
*Full Nave's entry:*

- God inhabits: Isa 57:15; Mic 5:2
- God rules: Jer 10:10
- See GOD, ETERNITY OF
- UNCLASSIFIED SCRIPTURES RELATING TO: Psa 30:12; 41:13; 72:17; 90:2; 110:4; 119:142; Mat 6:13; 18:8; 2Co 9:9; Jude 1:6
  - See LIFE, EVERLASTING
  - See PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL

*Note: Mat 18:8 ("everlasting fire") and Jude 1:6 ("everlasting [aidios] chains") appear as "unclassified scriptures" under ETERNITY. The fact that aidios (G126, Jude 1:6) and aionios (G166, Mat 18:8) both appear under the same topical entry without differentiation is typical of topical concordances — they do not distinguish between the two distinct Greek adjectives.*

### PUNISHMENT (ETERNAL subsection)
*Full Nave's entry for PUNISHMENT — ETERNAL subsection:*

Isa 34:8-10; Dan 12:2; Mat 3:12; 10:28; 18:8; 25:41,46; Mrk 3:29; Luk 3:17; Jhn 5:29; Heb 6:2; 10:28-31; Rev 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10

*Cross-reference:*
- See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

*Additional PUNISHMENT entry sections directly relevant:*
- PUNISHMENT, ACCORDING TO DEEDS: Job 34:11; Psa 62:12; Pro 12:14; 24:12; Isa 59:18; Jer 17:10; Ezk 7:3,27; 16:59; 39:24; Zec 1:6; Mat 5:22; 16:27; 23:14; Luk 12:47,48; 20:47
- PUNISHMENT, DIVINE, NO ESCAPE FROM: Job 11:20; Pro 1:24-31; 11:21; 16:5; 29:1; Jer 11:11; 15:1; 25:28,29; Ezk 7:19; Amo 2:14-16; Zep 1:18; Mat 10:28; 23:33; Rom 2:3; Col 3:25; Heb 2:3; 12:25

*Note: The PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL subsection lists Isa 34:8-10 as its first OT reference — the very passage that was confirmed as the highest-scoring OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (hybrid score 0.401) in etc5-07. This independently corroborates E182.*

### FIRE (EVERLASTING FIRE subsection)
*Full Nave's — FIRE entry:*

FIGURATIVE uses include:
- Judgments: Deu 4:24; 32:22; Isa 33:14; Jer 23:29; Amo 1:4,7,10,12,14; 2:2; Mal 3:2; Luk 12:49; Rev 20:9
- Of the destruction of the wicked: Mat 13:42,50; 25:41; Mrk 9:44; Rev 9:2; 21:8

**EVERLASTING FIRE subsection:**
Isa 33:14; Mat 18:8; 25:41; Mrk 9:44

*Note: The FIRE, EVERLASTING entry in Nave's contains only 4 verses: Isa 33:14 (OT background), Mat 18:8, Mat 25:41, Mrk 9:44. Jude 1:7 is NOT included in this subsection, even though it uses the same phrase "eternal fire" (puros aioniou). This is a significant gap — the Jude 1:7 instance (with 2Pet 2:6 cross-reference confirming the fire reduced Sodom to ashes) is critical for establishing what "eternal fire" means.*

## Summary of Topical Data for Analysis

The Nave's topical entries confirm:

1. **Both outcomes use the same adjective (aionios)**: IMMORTALITY lists both "eternal life" passages and judgment passages (including 2Th 1:7-9) in a single undifferentiated list.

2. **PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL begins with Isa 34:8-10**: This independently confirms the LXX/OT background for the NT eternal punishment passages, aligning with E182 (Isa 34:10 as top OT parallel for Rev 14:11).

3. **FIRE, EVERLASTING lists only 4 NT passages**: Mat 18:8; 25:41; Mrk 9:44 — but notably omits Jude 1:7, which is the passage where the fire's outcome is specified as ashes (2Pet 2:6).

4. **ETERNITY lists both aidios (Jude 1:6) and aionios (Mat 18:8) without distinction**: Traditional topical concordances do not differentiate between the two Greek words.

5. **Rev 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10 appear under PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL**: These three "for ever and ever" passages are the Nave's basis for ECT in Revelation.
