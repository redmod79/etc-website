## 1. G166 Aionios — Complete Distribution Analysis

### 1.1 Lexical Data: What the Definition States

Strong's / BLB definition of G166 (aionios): "perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well)" — from G165 (aion = "an age; properly, an age").

The definition explicitly acknowledges bidirectionality. The word is not constrained to forward-pointing endless duration; it can refer to past ages (Rom 16:25; 2Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2) and to the relationship between past and future ages.

Morphological structure: aion + -ios (the Greek denominal adjectival suffix meaning "pertaining to" or "characteristic of"). The same suffix appears in ouranios (heavenly, from ouranos = heaven), ephemerios (daily/of the day, from ephemera). The word is formed as "age-pertaining" or "age-characterized," not as a negative formation (alpha-privative). Compare: G110 athanasia = a-thanatos (un-death-ness), G861 aphtharsia = a-phtheiro (un-corruption). The genuine "un-ending" concepts in Greek are alpha-privative; aionios is not.

### 1.2 Distribution Across 71 BLB Occurrences

KJV renders G166 in 12 distinct ways across 48 KJV occurrences. The tool-verified distribution:
- "eternal" 19x (39.6%)
- "everlasting" 13x (27.1%)
- "of eternal" 7x (14.6%)
- "since the world began" 1x (Rom 16:25 — PAST time reference)
- "for ever" 1x (Phm 1:15 — human relationship, bounded by lifespan)
- Other variants 7x

Subject-categorized groupings across 71 BLB occurrences:
- Group A (positive eschatological): ~23 with "life" (zoe); additional with glory, salvation, covenant, Spirit, inheritance, consolation, habitations, gospel = ~37 total positive
- Group B (negative eschatological): fire (3x), punishment (1x), destruction (1x), damnation/sin (1x), judgment (1x) = ~7 negative
- Group C (non-eschatological): past-time references (3x: Rom 16:25; 2Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2), human relationship (1x: Phm 1:15), event-nouns (redemption, salvation, inheritance, covenant, Spirit) = ~14 Group C
- Group D (aion noun as age-marker): root noun uses in adjacent passages

## 2. G166 vs. G126 — Aionios vs. Aidios (The Word-Choice Analysis)

### 2.1 The Two Greek Words

G166 (aionios): from G165 (aion = "an age"). BLB definition: "perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well)." 71 NT occurrences.

G126 (aidios): from G104 (aei = "always/continually"). BLB definition: "everduring (forward and backward, or forward)." 2 NT occurrences ONLY.

Root contrast: aionios derives from aion (an age/era); aidios derives from aei (always, the adverb of continued unbroken duration). G104 (aei) is used 8 times in the NT and translated "always" 7 times and "ever" once.

### 2.2 The Two NT Occurrences of Aidios

**Romans 1:20** — Greek: he te aidios autou dunamis kai theiotēs
- aidios (G126, A-NSF) modifies dunamis (power) and theiotēs (Godhead/divinity)
- Paul used aidios, not aionios, to describe God's intrinsic power and divine nature
- In the same epistle, Paul uses aionios for "eternal life" (Rom 2:7; 5:21; 6:22,23)

**Jude 1:6** — Greek: desmois aidiois hupo zophon teterekën
- aidios (G126, A-DPM) modifies desmois (chains/bonds)
- teterekën = perfect tense: the angels are currently in a state of being confined — the chains are genuinely ongoing
- In the immediately following verse (Jude 1:7), Jude uses aionios (G166) for Sodom's "eternal fire" — the same fire that 2 Pet 2:6 states produced ashes

### 2.3 Observations on the Word-Choice

The two Greek words are distinct. When Paul in Romans wished to describe God's intrinsic divine power, he chose aidios (the word derived from "always"). In the same epistle, Paul applies aionios to eternal life. Jude uses both words in adjacent verses: aidios for the fallen angels' current, ongoing confinement; aionios for Sodom's completed, result-permanent judgment.

The two words have different definitions: aidios = "everduring (forward and backward, or forward)"; aionios = "perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well)."

## 3. Group A — Positive Aionios Passages

### 3.1 John 17:3 — Eternal Life Defined

"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."

Greek parsing: haute de estin he aionios zoe — aionios (G166, A-NSF) modifies zoe (G2222, N-NSF). The sentence is a predicate-nominative definition: "This IS eternal life: that they might know you..."

The definition locates eternal life in a relationship of knowing God, not in a quality of duration. The hina clause (that they might know) is the content of what eternal life consists in.

### 3.2 Mark 10:30 — Eternal Life in the Coming Age

"...in the world to come eternal life [zoen aionion]."

Greek: aioni to erchomeno (coming age) + zoen aionion (eternal life). The verse places eternal life explicitly in "the coming age" (ho aion ho erchomenos). Both the noun (aion = age) and the adjective (aionios = age-pertaining) appear in the same verse: life pertaining to the age belongs to the coming age. The connection between aionios and aion is here linguistically transparent.

### 3.3 1 John 5:11-12 — Life Is in the Son; Without the Son, No Life

"God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."

The state of those without the Son is described as "not having life" (ouk echei ten zoen) — the absence of life, not an alternative form of conscious existence.

### 3.4 Titus 1:2 — Dual Use in One Verse

"In hope of eternal life [zoes aionion]... which God... promised before the world began [pro chronon aionion]."

Greek parsing confirmed: Two uses of G166 in the same verse. "Eternal life" (zoes aionion) looks forward. "Before age-long times" (pro chronon aionion) looks backward to before ages began. The same adjective operates in both temporal directions in a single verse.

### 3.5 Romans 6:22-23 — Eternal Life as Gift Contrasted with Death as Wages

"The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."

The structural antithesis: death (thanatos) vs. eternal life (zoe aionios). The two outcomes are placed at opposite poles of a gift/wages contrast.

---

## 4. Group B — Negative Aionios Passages (Verse by Verse)

### 4.1 Matthew 18:8 — Everlasting Fire

"...it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire."

Greek: eis to pyr to aionion — pyr (G4442, N-ASN) + aionion (G166, A-ASN). The fire is neuter (agrees with pyr). The casting is an Aorist Passive Infinitive (blethenai) — a completed, single action into the fire. The hyperbolic context (cutting off hand/foot) is a call to radical discipleship; the fire is the negative counterpart to "entering into life."

### 4.2 Matthew 25:41 — Everlasting Fire Prepared for the Devil

"Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."

Greek parsing: eis to pyr to aionion to hetoimasmenon tō diabolō kai tois angelois autou
- hetoimasmenon (G2090, V-RPP-ASN) = perfect passive participle: "having been prepared" — already prepared, the action is complete
- diabolō (G1228, A-DSM) = DATIVE: the fire was prepared FOR the devil (dative of advantage/purpose)
- angelois (G32, N-DPM) = DATIVE: and his angels

The fire was prepared for the devil and his angels. Human beings are directed into a fire whose primary designed recipients are named as supernatural entities.

### 4.3 Matthew 25:46 — THE CENTRAL VERSE

"And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."

Greek parsing (confirmed by tool): kai apeleusontai houtoi eis kolasin aionion, hoi de dikaioi eis zoen aionion.
- kolasin (G2851, N-ASF) "punishment" — Acc Sg F
- aionion (G166, A-ASF) "eternal" — Acc Sg F — IDENTICAL FORM to the second aionion
- zoen (G2222, N-ASF) "life" — Acc Sg F
- aionion (G166, A-ASF) "eternal" — Acc Sg F — IDENTICAL FORM

Both nouns (kolasin, zoen) are Accusative Singular Feminine. Both adjectives are Accusative Singular Feminine. The grammatical parallelism is exact.

The word is kolasis (G2851) — defined as "penal infliction" from kolazo (to prune/curtail). This is not basanismos (torment). Kolasis appears only twice in the NT: Mat 25:46 and 1Jn 4:18.

OT parallels for Mat 25:46 (tool-verified): Top matches cluster around "age" and "alive" vocabulary. The highest OT parallel is Ezk 18:21 (score 0.391) — the passage about the wicked turning from his ways and living. The two-outcome framework has its deepest OT roots in the life/death antithesis (Ezk 18), not in the torment/life antithesis.

### 4.4 Mark 3:28-30 — Eternal Sin

"But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation [aioniou hamartematos]."

Greek (N1904 text): enochos estin aioniou hamartematos
- aioniou (G166, A-GSF) "eternal/age-long" — Gen Sg F
- hamartematos (G265, N-GSN) "sin/offence" — Gen Sg N

The N1904 Greek text reads "eternal SIN" (hamartematos), not "eternal judgment" (krima). The grammatical construction is genitive: "guilty of an eternal sin" — an offense whose character is eternal/permanent, not merely a lasting verdict. The passage also uses eis ton aiona (G165, the noun: "into the age") for "never forgiveness" — demonstrating both the noun and the adjective in close proximity.

### 4.5 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10 — Everlasting Destruction

"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power."

Greek parsing: olethron aionion apo prosopou tou Kyriou
- olethron (G3639, N-ASM) "destruction/ruin" — Acc Sg M
- aionion (G166, A-ASM) "eternal" — Acc Sg M — agrees with masculine olethron
- apo prosopou = "from the presence/face" — a separation/expulsion phrase

Paul's chosen noun is olethros (G3639 = ruin/destruction), not basanismos (torment). Paul uses the same noun (olethros) in 1Th 5:3 ("sudden destruction"), 1Co 5:5 ("destruction of the flesh"), and 1Ti 6:9 ("destruction and perdition"). The consistent semantic range of olethros is ruin, not ongoing torment.

OT parallels for 2Th 1:9 (tool-verified): Top OT matches include Ezk 25:15 ("destruction" + "age" at #6) and Ps 68:2 / Ps 9:3 (wicked perish abad at the presence of God = the presence is the destructive agent in OT idiom). No high-scoring OT parallel combines "eternal" + "torment" vocabulary for this passage.

### 4.6 Hebrews 6:1-3 — Eternal Judgment

"...of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."

Greek: krimatos aioniou — krima (judgment-verdict) + aionios. Krima is an event noun: a verdict rendered once. The aionios here characterizes the finality and permanence of the verdict, not the ongoing duration of a process. This is the event-noun pattern (see Section 5.2).

### 4.7 Jude 1:7 — Eternal Fire Applied to Sodom

"Even as Sodom and Gomorrha... are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."

Greek parsing: prokeitai deigma puros aioniou diken hupechousai
- puros (G4442, N-GSN) + aioniou (G166, A-GSN) — genitive construction
- deigma (G1164) = "example/specimen" — Sodom IS the stated example
- hupechousai = present active participle: "undergoing [the] penalty" — the ongoing display as an example, not ongoing fire

2 Peter 2:6 (same author-tradition, same event): "And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes [tephra] condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly."

The fire on Sodom is called "eternal" (aionios) in Jude 1:7. The same event is described as "turning into ashes" in 2 Pet 2:6. The fire is not currently burning under Sodom's territory. The "eternal" character attaches to the permanent result, not the ongoing process (this establishes N029 from etc5-05, cited as existing in master).

### 4.8 Revelation 14:6 — Everlasting Gospel (Positive, Non-Judgment)

"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel [euangelion aionion] to preach unto them that dwell on the earth."

G166 here modifies euangelion (gospel). The everlasting gospel is a proclamation whose character is permanent/age-spanning. This occurrence demonstrates that aionios in Revelation is not restricted to judgment contexts.

---

## 5. Group C — Non-Eschatological Uses

### 5.1 Past-Time Uses

**Romans 16:25** — chronois aioniois seseigemenou ("having been kept silent in age-long times")
- Greek: chronois (G5550, N-DPM) + aioniois (G166, A-DPM) — past ages
- The mystery was hidden DURING the ages past
- KJV: "since the world began"
- Aionios looks BACKWARD to elapsed ages

**2 Timothy 1:9** — pro chronon aionion ("before age-long times")
- Greek: pro + chronon (G5550, N-GPM) + aionion (G166, A-GPM) — before the ages
- Grace was given before the age-period began
- KJV: "before the world began"

**Titus 1:2** — pro chronon aionion (same construction as 2Tim 1:9)
- SAME VERSE also contains "eternal life" (zoes aionion) looking FORWARD
- The same adjective operates bidirectionally in a single verse

Observation: Aionios can refer to the past. This is the lexicographically documented fact (BLB definition states "also used of past time"). A word that can look backward cannot be inherently "forward-pointing endless."

### 5.2 The Event-Noun Pattern (Hebrews)

Aionios modifies EVENT NOUNS — completed acts whose results persist permanently:

**Hebrews 9:12** — lutrosin aionion ("eternal redemption")
- Greek parsing: eiselthen ephapax (entered ONCE FOR ALL, Aorist); aionion lutrosin heuramenos (having obtained eternal redemption, Aorist Participle)
- Lutrosin = event noun (the act of ransoming/redeeming)
- ephapax = "once for all" — single completed event
- "Eternal redemption" = the redemption accomplished once, whose effects abide permanently

**Hebrews 5:9** — soterian aionion ("eternal salvation")
- Accomplished by Christ's obedience; the act is complete; the aionios quality describes the permanent result

**Hebrews 6:2** — krimatos aioniou ("eternal judgment")
- Krima = a verdict rendered once; the aionios character = the verdict's irrevocability

**Hebrews 9:14-15** — pneumatos aioniou ("eternal Spirit"); kleronomian aionion ("eternal inheritance")
- Spirit who transcends ages; inheritance that is permanent

**Hebrews 13:20** — diatheleis aionious ("everlasting covenant")
- The new covenant whose character is age-spanning and permanent

Pattern summary: When aionios modifies an event-noun or a result-noun, the adjective characterizes the permanence of the result rather than the duration of an ongoing process. The event occurred once; its effect is permanent. This pattern applies across five Hebrews occurrences.

### 5.3 Philemon 1:15 — Human Relationship

"For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever [aionion]."

Greek: hina aionion auton apecheis
- aionion (G166, A-ASM) modifies Onesimus (auton = him, a person)
- The relationship between Philemon and Onesimus is bounded by their natural lifespans

Paul uses aionion to mean "permanently" or "for the rest of your lives" regarding a human relationship. Neither Philemon nor Onesimus is immortal; neither will live without end. Aionios here = permanent/lasting for the relevant period, not "without end."

---

## 6. Group D — Aion as Explicit Age-Marker

### 6.1 Aion in the NT as "Age/Era"

G165 (aion) is translated "world" (= age/era) 30 times by the KJV — demonstrating the age/era semantic is primary. Key uses:

- "This age" (ho aion houtos): Mat 12:32; 13:22; Luk 16:8; 1Co 2:6,8; 2Co 4:4; Gal 1:4
- "The age to come" (ho aion ho erchomenos / ho aion ho mellōn): Mat 12:32; Mrk 10:30; Luk 18:30; 20:35
- "End of the age" (synteleia tou aionos): Mat 13:39,40,49; 24:3; 28:20 — the age HAS AN END
- "The ages" (plural hoi aiones): Heb 1:2; 11:3; Eph 3:11; Col 1:26 — the word is used in the plural

Matthew 28:20: "lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world [aionos]." The age ends. The root noun from which aionios derives explicitly has an end.

Colossians 1:26: "the mystery which hath been hid from ages [aionon] and from generations." The mystery was hidden DURING the ages (plural) — these are elapsed historical ages.

### 6.2 "For Ever and Ever" = eis tous aionas ton aionon

The phrase translated "for ever and ever" is literally "into the ages of the ages" — eis tous aionas ton aionon. This phrase uses G165 (the PLURAL NOUN aion), NOT G166 (the adjective aionios).

The phrase appears approximately 20 times:

Applied to God/Christ (14-15 occurrences): Gal 1:5; 1Ti 1:17; Heb 1:8; 13:21; 1Pe 4:11; Rev 1:6; 4:9,10; 5:13,14; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 15:7; 22:5 — here the "for ever and ever" is genuinely endless because God's nature is genuinely without limit.

Applied to judgment subjects (3 occurrences):
- **Rev 14:11**: "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever [eis aionas aionon]" — the GRAMMATICAL SUBJECT is "the smoke" (ho kapnos, nominative), not the people
- **Rev 19:3**: "her smoke rose up for ever and ever" — Babylon's smoke, not Babylon's people; grammatical subject = smoke (ho kapnos)
- **Rev 20:10**: "shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever" — devil, beast, false prophet (named supernatural/symbolic entities)

---

## 7. The "For Ever and Ever" Phrase — Detailed Analysis

### 7.1 Grammatical Subject in Smoke Passages

**Revelation 14:11** — Greek parsing confirmed:
- ho kapnos (G2586, N-NSM) "THE SMOKE" — NOMINATIVE = grammatical subject of anabainei
- basanismou (G929, N-GSM) "of the torment" — GENITIVE = attribute of the smoke
- aionas aionon = "ages of ages"
- anabainei (V-PAI-3S) = "ascends" — the smoke ascends

The smoke ascends. The people (beast-worshippers) lack rest day and night — a separate clause with a participial subject identifying those who worship the beast.

OT parallel: Isa 34:10 is the highest-scoring OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (tool-verified hybrid score 0.401 with theological flag). "The smoke thereof shall go up for ever" (Isa 34:10) describes the permanent desolation of Edom's land — the land is a wasteland, not a site of ongoing conscious activity. Animals immediately take possession of the desolated land (Isa 34:11-17). The smoke-for-ever formula describes permanent ruin.

**Revelation 19:3** — "her smoke rose up for ever and ever" — Babylon's smoke. The grammatical subject is smoke (ho kapnos). The same formula as Isa 34:10 (Edom's smoke).

**Revelation 20:10** — "shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever" — the grammatical subjects are specifically named: "the devil AND the beast AND the false prophet." Future passive indicative (basanisthesontai, 3rd plural) with three named entities as subjects.

### 7.2 Subject Differentiation in Revelation 20:9-15

The passage contains distinct vocabulary for different subjects in adjacent verses:
- Rev 20:9: Human armies "devoured" (katephagen, G2719 — consumed/eaten up) — DESTRUCTION vocabulary
- Rev 20:10: Devil, beast, false prophet "shall be tormented" (basanisthesontai) for ever and ever — TORMENT vocabulary for named supernatural/symbolic entities
- Rev 20:14: Lake of fire = "the second death" — DEATH vocabulary applied to the lake itself
- Rev 20:15: Generic human wicked "cast into the lake of fire" — no "for ever and ever torment" language applied to them

The "tormented day and night for ever and ever" language of Rev 20:10 is applied to three named entities (devil, beast, false prophet) and not repeated for the general human wicked in v.15.

---

## 8. Jude 1:7 + 2 Peter 2:6 — Sodom as Biblical Definition of Eternal Fire

### 8.1 Jude's Explicit Statement

Jude 1:7: "Even as Sodom and Gomorrha... are set forth for an example [deigma], suffering the vengeance of eternal fire [puros aioniou]."

The word deigma (G1164) = "specimen/example." Sodom IS the example. The cities are set forth AS the example of what "eternal fire" looks like.

### 8.2 Peter's Description of the Same Event

2 Peter 2:6: "And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes [tephra] condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample [hupodeigma] unto those that after should live ungodly."

The same event, the same author-tradition. Peter uses hupodeigma (G5262 = pattern/example) for the same Sodom event. The result of the "eternal fire" on Sodom: ashes (tephra).

### 8.3 The Bible's Own Cross-Reference

The Bible provides its own cross-reference for "eternal fire": the fire that reduced Sodom to ashes. The "eternal" character of the fire is not that it continues burning today; rather, the result of the fire is permanent and irrevocable (the cities remain destroyed). This is the event-noun + aionios pattern applied to judgment: the judgment-by-fire is permanent in its result.

Sodom is not currently a site of ongoing conscious activity or ongoing burning fire. It is a permanently desolated region. The "eternal fire" produced ashes, and the judgment stands permanently.

---

## 9. Matthew 25:46 Symmetry Analysis — The Central Debate Passage

### 9.1 What the Text States

The Greek grammatical form is exactly parallel:
- "these... into punishment eternal" (kolasin aionion — Acc Sg F both)
- "the righteous... into life eternal" (zoen aionion — Acc Sg F both)

The SAME adjective (aionios), SAME grammatical form (A-ASF), modifies both outcomes. This is a textual fact both sides must acknowledge.

### 9.2 What the Symmetry Argument Claims

The ECT position: if aionios means "endless duration" for the life outcome, it must mean "endless duration" for the punishment outcome. The same adjective applied identically to both sides of the contrast governs both equally.

The conditionalist position: aionios in both cases means "permanent" with the actual duration contextually determined by the subject's nature (N034 — established by Hab 3:6's same-verse demonstration). "Life" in God is genuinely endless because God's nature is genuinely endless (and eternal life is defined as knowing the only true God — Jhn 17:3). The "punishment" is permanent/irrevocable (the verdict is final and permanent) — aionios describes the character of the outcome, not the mechanism.

### 9.3 The Noun Matters

The negative noun is kolasis (punishment), not basanismos (torment). Kolasis derives from kolazo (to prune/curtail/restrain). The word describes the category of outcome (penal infliction) without specifying the mechanism (whether ongoing conscious suffering or a permanent state of having been penalized).

The noun in the positive clause is zoe (life). Life is an ongoing state by definition — to have life is to be living. Punishment is not by definition an ongoing state — one can punish (a single act) whose effect is permanent. The nouns themselves differ in whether they denote an ongoing state or a completed act.

### 9.4 OT Background for the Two-Outcome Structure

The OT two-outcome framework (established in Dan 12:2, the highest OT parallel for the two-outcome structure) uses olam for both "everlasting life" and "everlasting contempt." The LXX renders both as aionios (N035 — established in etc5-07). The OT pattern consistently pairs olam with destruction/death vocabulary in punishment contexts, not with torment vocabulary (IA021 — established in etc5-07).

The top OT parallel for Mat 25:46 (tool-verified at 0.391) is Ezk 18:21 — the life-or-death (live vs. die) framework of Ezekiel 18, not a torment/life framework.

## 10. Difficult Passages — ECT Evidence Examined Honestly

### 10.1 Revelation 14:10-11

Full text: "The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name."

What the text directly states:
- Basanizo (torment) is applied to those who worship the beast and receive his mark
- Basanismos (torment, genitive) is the source of the smoke
- The smoke ascends "for ever and ever" (eis aionas aionon)
- These subjects "have no rest day nor night"

This passage is E150 in the master evidence file (Neutral, reclassified etc5-18). The torment vocabulary is genuine and explicit. The subject is a specific eschatological class: those with the mark of the beast who worship the beast during the Tribulation period.

The smoke ascending "for ever and ever" has its highest OT parallel in Isa 34:10 (tool-verified score 0.401) — a desolation formula. The grammatical subject of "ascendeth" is "the smoke" (ho kapnos, nominative), not the persons.

This is an I-B passage (IB009 in master) — the OT source imagery and the direct torment vocabulary are both textual data. See Section 7.1.

### 10.2 Revelation 20:10

Full text: "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."

What the text directly states:
- Named subjects: the devil, the beast, the false prophet
- basanisthesontai (shall be tormented, Future Passive Indicative 3rd Plural) — torment verb
- "day and night for ever and ever" (hemeras kai nyktos eis tous aionas ton aionon)

This passage is E149 in the master evidence file (Neutral, reclassified etc5-18). The subjects are three named supernatural/symbolic entities — the primary agents of evil in Revelation's narrative.

The immediately following context (Rev 20:14-15) applies different vocabulary to the general human wicked: they are "cast into the lake of fire" (without "tormented day and night for ever and ever") and the lake of fire is identified as "the second death."

### 10.3 Vocabulary Distribution Summary

The torment vocabulary in Revelation:
- G929 (basanismos = torment, noun): 6 occurrences, ALL in Revelation (E172)
- G928 (basanizo = torment, verb): eschatological uses ONLY in Revelation (E181)
- Neither word appears in any didactic epistle in eschatological context

Paul's chosen vocabulary for the wicked's eternal punishment (2Th 1:9): olethros (destruction) + aionios
Jesus's chosen vocabulary in the central judgment parable (Mat 25:46): kolasis (punishment) + aionios

The torment vocabulary and the destruction vocabulary are lexically separate and never appear together in the same judgment description for the same subject (N033 — established in etc5-06).

---

## 11. Patterns Identified

### 11.1 Aionios Adapts to Its Subject

The same adjective modifies:
- God (eternally genuine): "eternal Spirit" (Heb 9:14), God's "eternal purpose" (Eph 3:11)
- A human lifespan (bounded): "for ever" (Phm 1:15)
- Past ages (backward-looking): "since the world began" (Rom 16:25)
- Completed events (permanent result): "eternal redemption" (Heb 9:12), "eternal judgment" (Heb 6:2)
- Sodom's fire (completed, ashes): "eternal fire" (Jude 1:7) + ashes (2Pet 2:6)

This distribution is consistent with N034 (established in etc5-07): the duration is contextually determined by the nature of the subject, not by the word itself.

### 11.2 The Event-Noun Pattern Is Consistent

Every Hebrews aionios passage (9:12; 5:9; 6:2; 9:14; 9:15; 13:20) applies the adjective to a noun that names a completed act or a resulting state (redemption, salvation, judgment, Spirit, inheritance, covenant). The aionios character describes the permanent result, not an ongoing process.

When "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion, Mat 25:46) and "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion, 2Th 1:9) are placed alongside these Hebrews uses, the event-noun pattern extends: punishment and destruction are the completed acts whose permanent results are described as aionion.

### 11.3 Aidios Is the Word for Genuine Inherent Endlessness

When the NT wishes to describe something as intrinsically and genuinely everduring (forward and backward), it uses aidios (G126), not aionios. Paul uses aidios for God's power (Rom 1:20). Jude uses aidios for the ongoing confinement of fallen angels (Jude 1:6) — their chains are currently binding them and are genuinely ongoing. In the same letter, the same author uses aionios for Sodom's fire, which is not ongoing.

### 11.4 The Torment Vocabulary Is Confined to Revelation

All six NT occurrences of basanismos (G929) are in Revelation. The eschatological uses of basanizo (G928) are in Revelation. Neither Paul nor John (in his epistles) nor the other epistle writers use this vocabulary for the fate of the wicked. The didactic teaching passages use destruction vocabulary (olethros, apollumi, apoleia) and punishment vocabulary (kolasis). This is N033 (established in etc5-06).

## 12. Connections Between Passages

### 12.1 Dan 12:2 → Mat 25:46 → 2Th 1:9

The tool confirms: Dan 12:2 → Mat 25:46 (NT parallel score 0.334); Mat 25:46 → 2Th 1:9 (NT parallel score 0.380). These three passages form a chain:
- Dan 12:2: olam for both outcomes (LXX: aionios) — the two-outcome resurrection teaching
- Mat 25:46: aionion for both outcomes — kolasis (punishment) vs. zoe (life)
- 2Th 1:9: aionion modifying olethros (destruction) — Paul's explication of what the punishment is

Paul's explication (destruction) constrains how Mat 25:46's kolasis is read.

### 12.2 Jude 1:7 + 2Pet 2:6 → N029 → IA020

Jude 1:7 calls Sodom's fire "eternal" (aionios). 2Pet 2:6 says it produced "ashes." N029 (established in etc5-05): eternal fire = permanent result, not ongoing process. IA020 (established in etc5-06): this pattern extends to "everlasting destruction" (2Th 1:9) — aionion modifies the permanence of the destruction's result. This chain connects the Sodom passage to the 2Th 1:9 passage.

### 12.3 Mat 25:41 → Rev 19:20 → Rev 20:10

Tool parallels confirm: Mat 25:41 (everlasting fire prepared for devil/his angels) → Rev 19:20 (beast and false prophet cast into lake, score 0.641 for Rev 20:10) → Rev 20:10 (devil, beast, false prophet tormented for ever). The fire prepared for the devil (Mat 25:41) is realized in Rev 20:10 as the lake of fire where the same entities are assigned.

## 13. Word Study Insights

### 13.1 Kolasis vs. Basanismos

The central eschatological judgment passage (Mat 25:46) uses kolasis (G2851 = "penal infliction" from kolazo = to prune/curtail). The Revelation torment passages use basanismos (G929 = "torture/torment"). These are distinct words with distinct roots.

Kolasis occurs twice in the NT: Mat 25:46 (eschatological) and 1Jn 4:18 ("fear hath torment/punishment"). The LXX uses kolasis in Ezk 14:3 (idols as "stumbling blocks of punishment"). The root (pruning/curtailing) emphasizes the punitive/restrictive dimension, not specifically the experience of suffering.

### 13.2 Olethros — Paul's Chosen Eschatological Term

Paul uses olethros (G3639 = ruin/destruction) four times in the NT. In 2Th 1:9, it is his chosen noun for the eternal fate of the wicked. Olethros is a noun of result — "ruin" describes the state resulting from destruction, not an ongoing process.

The OT parallels for 2Th 1:9 (tool-verified): no high-scoring parallel combines "eternal" with "torment" vocabulary. The word background points to destruction/ruin, not ongoing conscious suffering.

### 13.3 LXX Bridge (N034 and N035)

H5769 (olam) → G166 (aionios): 100 occurrences, PMI 5.67 — the dominant, statistically non-accidental correspondence. NT aionios carries the semantic range of olam (N035). Since olam's duration is contextually determined by the subject's nature (N034 — established by Hab 3:6's same-verse demonstration), aionios inherits the same contextual determination.

## 14. Difficult Passages Addressed

### 14.1 The Mat 25:46 Symmetry

The grammatical symmetry is a textual fact (E tier). Whether it requires identical duration for both outcomes is I-B territory. The reading "aionios describes the permanent character of both outcomes, with actual duration contextually determined by subject nature" is consistent with N034/N035. The reading "aionios requires identical endless duration for both outcomes" is also a grammatically supported reading. Both are inferences about what the symmetry implies. This is IB011's structure applied to the NT (see also IB011 for Dan 12:2).

### 14.2 Rev 20:10 — Named Supernatural Entities

The text names the devil, the beast, and the false prophet as subjects of "tormented day and night for ever and ever." These are the three primary supernatural/symbolic agents of the Tribulation narrative in Revelation. The immediately following verses (20:14-15) apply different vocabulary to the general human wicked.

Whether the torment of Rev 20:10 applies universally to all persons in the lake of fire or is specific to these three named entities is IB008 (established in etc5-05). The same-author, same-passage context (Rev 20:15 does not repeat the "tormented day and night for ever and ever" language for the human wicked) bears on this question.

### 14.3 Rev 14:10-11 — Beast-Worshippers

The text applies basanizo (torment) to a specific eschatological class: those who worship the beast and receive his mark. This is a tribulation-era specific group. The passage is torment-vocabulary evidence (E150, reclassified Neutral etc5-18) — the torment vocabulary is explicit. The OT source text for the smoke-imagery (Isa 34:10) points toward permanent-desolation formula; the direct torment vocabulary in the passage itself is also genuine. IB009 documents the tension and resolution.
