## Question
What does 2 Corinthians 5:1-8 teach about the intermediate state? Does "unclothed" (ekdysasthai) mean disembodied? What is Paul's actual preference and what does the clothing metaphor mean?

## Primary Passage: 2 Corinthians 4:14 -- 5:10 (Complete Pericope)

### 2 Corinthians 4 (Preceding Context: Affliction, Death, and Resurrection Hope)

> **4:7** But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
> **4:8** [We are] troubled on every side, yet not distressed; [we are] perplexed, but not in despair;
> **4:9** Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
> **4:10** Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
> **4:11** For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
> **4:12** So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
> **4:13** We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
> **4:14** Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present [us] with you.
> **4:15** For all things [are] for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.
> **4:16** For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is renewed day by day.
> **4:17** For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory;
> **4:18** While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal.

**Greek parsing notes for 4:14:**
- egeiras (G1453) = Aorist Active Participle "the one having raised"
- egerei (G1453) = Future Active Indicative "shall raise" -- future tense, pointing to a coming resurrection
- parastEsei (G3936) = Future Active Indicative "shall present" -- future, eschatological

**Greek parsing notes for 4:16-18:**
- diaphtheiretai (G1311) = Present Passive Indicative "is being destroyed" (outward man)
- anakainoutai (G341) = Present Passive Indicative "is being renewed" (inward man)
- proskaira (G4340) = "temporary/transient" (things seen)
- aiOnia (G166) = "eternal/age-lasting" (things not seen)

### 2 Corinthians 5:1-10 (Core Passage with Word-by-Word Greek Parsing)

> **5:1** For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

**Greek:** οἴδαμεν γὰρ ὅτι ἐὰν ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ, οἰκοδομὴν ἐκ Θεοῦ ἔχομεν, οἰκίαν ἀχειροποίητον αἰώνιον ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς.

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing | Translation |

| αἰώνιον | αἰώνιος | G166 | Adj Acc Sg F | eternal |
| ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς | οὐρανός | G3772 | Noun Dat Pl M | in the heavens |

**Key grammar:** ean + kataluthE = 3rd class conditional (real possibility). echomen = present tense "we have" (not "we will have").

> **5:2** For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:

**Greek:** καὶ γὰρ ἐν τούτῳ στενάζομεν, τὸ οἰκητήριον ἡμῶν τὸ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐπενδύσασθαι ἐπιποθοῦντες,

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing | Translation |
|------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| στενάζομεν | στενάζω | G4727 | Pres Act Ind 1P | we groan |
| τὸ οἰκητήριον | οἰκητήριον | G3613 | Noun Acc Sg N | the dwelling-place |
| ἡμῶν τὸ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ | | | | our [dwelling] from heaven |
| ἐπενδύσασθαι | ἐπενδύω | **G1902** | **Aor Mid Inf** | **to clothe upon ourselves** |
| ἐπιποθοῦντες | ἐπιποθέω | G1971 | Pres Act Ptcp Nom Pl M | longing/earnestly desiring |

**Key grammar:** ependysasthai = Aorist Middle Infinitive. The middle voice indicates the subject acting upon itself -- "to clothe ourselves upon." The compound ep- (upon) + endyO (clothe) = to put on over what is already worn. This is NOT simple endyO (put on) but ependyO (put on OVER).

> **5:3** If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.

**Greek:** εἴ γε καὶ ἐνδυσάμενοι οὐ γυμνοὶ εὑρεθησόμεθα.

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing | Translation |
|------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| εἴ γε | εἰ / γέ | G1487/G1065 | COND/PRT | if indeed |
| καὶ | καί | G2532 | CONJ | also/even |

| γυμνοὶ | γυμνός | **G1131** | Adj Nom Pl M | **naked** |
| εὑρεθησόμεθα | εὑρίσκω | G2147 | **Fut Pass Ind 1P** | **we shall be found** |

**Key grammar:** endysamenoi = Aorist Middle Participle of endyO (G1746, simple "clothe" -- NOT the compound ependyO). gymnoi = "naked/bare."

**TEXTUAL VARIANT:** Some MSS read ekdysamenoi ("having been UNclothed") instead of endysamenoi ("having been clothed"). This is a significant variant. N1904 reads endysamenoi. The TR appears to have a shorter reading.

> **5:4** For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.

**Greek:** καὶ γὰρ οἱ ὄντες ἐν τῷ σκήνει στενάζομεν βαρούμενοι ἐφ' ᾧ οὐ θέλομεν ἐκδύσασθαι ἀλλ' ἐπενδύσασθαι, ἵνα καταποθῇ τὸ θνητὸν ὑπὸ τῆς ζωῆς.

|------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| οἱ ὄντες | εἰμί | G1510 | Pres Act Ptcp Nom Pl M | the ones being |
| ἐν τῷ σκήνει | σκῆνος | **G4636** | Noun Dat Sg N | **in the tent** |

| ἐπενδύσασθαι | ἐπενδύω | **G1902** | **Aor Mid Inf** | **to clothe upon ourselves** |
| ἵνα | ἵνα | G2443 | CONJ | in order that |
| καταποθῇ | καταπίνω | **G2666** | **Aor Pass Subj 3S** | **might be swallowed up** |
| τὸ θνητὸν | θνητός | **G2349** | Adj Nom Sg N | **the mortal** |
| ὑπὸ τῆς ζωῆς | ζωή | G2222 | Noun Gen Sg F | by life |

**Key grammar:** The three infinitives are all Aorist Middle: ekdysasthai ("unclothe oneself"), ependysasthai ("clothe upon oneself"). The hina clause states purpose: "in order that the mortal might be swallowed up by life." katapothE (G2666) = same root as 1 Cor 15:54 "Death is swallowed up in victory."

> **5:5** Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

**Greek:** ὁ δὲ κατεργασάμενος ἡμᾶς εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο Θεός, ὁ δοὺς ἡμῖν τὸν ἀρραβῶνα τοῦ Πνεύματος.

Key: katergasamenos (G2716) = Aor Mid Ptcp "the one having worked/prepared"; arrabOna (G728) = "earnest/down payment/guarantee"; Pneumatos (G4151) = "of the Spirit"

> **5:6** Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:

**Greek:** Θαρροῦντες οὖν πάντοτε καὶ εἰδότες ὅτι ἐνδημοῦντες ἐν τῷ σώματι ἐκδημοῦμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου·

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing | Translation |
|------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Θαρροῦντες | θαρρέω | G2292 | Pres Act Ptcp Nom Pl M | being confident |
| πάντοτε | πάντοτε | G3842 | ADV | always |
| εἰδότες | οἶδα | G1492 | Perf Act Ptcp Nom Pl M | knowing |
| ἐνδημοῦντες | ἐνδημέω | **G1736** | **Pres Act Ptcp Nom Pl M** | **being at home** |
| ἐν τῷ σώματι | σῶμα | G4983 | Noun Dat Sg N | in the body |
| ἐκδημοῦμεν | ἐκδημέω | **G1553** | **Pres Act Ind 1P** | **we are absent from home** |
| ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου | κύριος | G2962 | Noun Gen Sg M | from the Lord |

**Key grammar:** endEmountes (Pres Ptcp) and ekdEmoumen (Pres Ind) -- present tense forms describing the current state: "while being at home in the body, we are away from home from the Lord."

> **5:7** (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

**Greek:** διὰ πίστεως γὰρ περιπατοῦμεν, οὐ διὰ εἴδους·

Parenthetical: pisteOs (G4102) = "faith"; eidous (G1491) = "sight/appearance"

> **5:8** We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

**Greek:** θαρροῦμεν δὲ καὶ εὐδοκοῦμεν μᾶλλον ἐκδημῆσαι ἐκ τοῦ σώματος καὶ ἐνδημῆσαι πρὸς τὸν Κύριον.

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing | Translation |
|------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| θαρροῦμεν | θαρρέω | G2292 | Pres Act Ind 1P | we are confident |
| εὐδοκοῦμεν | εὐδοκέω | G2106 | Pres Act Ind 1P | we are pleased/willing |
| μᾶλλον | μᾶλλον | G3123 | ADV | rather/more |
| ἐκδημῆσαι | ἐκδημέω | **G1553** | **Aor Act Inf** | **to be absent from home** |
| ἐκ τοῦ σώματος | σῶμα | G4983 | Noun Gen Sg N | from the body |
| ἐνδημῆσαι | ἐνδημέω | **G1736** | **Aor Act Inf** | **to be at home** |
| πρὸς τὸν Κύριον | κύριος | G2962 | Noun Acc Sg M | with the Lord |

**Key grammar:** Both infinitives are Aorist Active (not Middle as in 5:2,4). The aorist presents each action as a whole event. eudokoumen = "we are pleased/well-pleased" (stronger than "willing").

> **5:9** Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
> **5:10** For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.

## Parallel Pauline Resurrection/Body Passages

### 1 Corinthians 15:35-58 (The Resurrection Body)

> **15:35** But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
> **15:36** [Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
> **15:37** And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare [gymnos, G1131] grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other [grain]:
> **15:38** But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
> **15:42** So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
> **15:43** It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
> **15:44** It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
> **15:49** And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
> **15:50** Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
> **15:51** Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
> **15:52** In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
> **15:53** For this corruptible must put on [endysasthai, G1746, Aor Mid Inf] incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on [endysasthai] immortality.
> **15:54** So when this corruptible shall have put on [endysEtai, G1746, Aor Mid Subj] incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up [KatepothE, G2666, Aor Pass Ind] in victory.
> **15:55** O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory?
> **15:56** The sting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law.
> **15:57** But thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
> **15:58** Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

**Vocabulary connections to 2 Cor 5:**
- endysasthai (G1746) in 15:53 = same root as ependysasthai (G1902) in 2 Cor 5:2,4 (compound form)
- thnEton (G2349, "mortal") in 15:53,54 = same word in 2 Cor 5:4
- katepothE (G2666, "swallowed up") in 15:54 = same root as katapothE in 2 Cor 5:4
- gymnos (G1131, "bare") in 15:37 = same word as gymnoi in 2 Cor 5:3

### Philippians 1:20-26 (To Depart and Be with Christ)

> **1:20** According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.
> **1:21** For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.
> **1:22** But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
> **1:23** For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart [analysai, G360, Aor Act Inf], and to be with Christ [syn ChristO einai]; which is far better:
> **1:24** Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.
> **1:25** And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
> **1:26** That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.

**Greek parsing of key verse (1:23):**
- synechomai (G4912) = Pres Pass Ind "I am pressed/constrained"
- analysai (G360) = Aor Act Inf "to depart" (NOT ekdEmEsai -- different word)
- einai (G1510) = Pres Act Inf "to be" (with Christ)
- kreisson (G2908) = Comparative Adj "better"

**Note:** Paul uses analysai ("to depart/loose") here, not ekdEmEsai ("to be absent from home") as in 2 Cor 5:8. Different vocabulary for a related concept.

### Philippians 3:20-21 (Transformation of the Body)

> **3:20** For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
> **3:21** Who shall change [metaschEmatizO, G3345] our vile body [sOma, G4983], that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.

### Romans 8:18-25 (Groaning for Redemption of the Body)

> **8:18** For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
> **8:19** For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
> **8:22** For we know that the whole creation groaneth [systenazei, G4959 -- compound of stenazO] and travaileth in pain together until now.
> **8:23** And not only [they], but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan [stenazomen, G4727] within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body [tEn apolytrOsin tou sOmatos hEmOn].
> **8:24** For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
> **8:25** But if we hope for that we see not, [then] do we with patience wait for [it].

**Key connections to 2 Cor 5:**
- stenazomen (G4727) = "we groan" -- same word and same form as 2 Cor 5:2,4
- "firstfruits of the Spirit" (8:23) parallels "earnest of the Spirit" (2 Cor 5:5)
- "redemption of our body" (8:23) -- what the groaning is FOR = bodily redemption, not escape from the body

### 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 (The Dead in Christ Rise)

> **4:13** But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
> **4:14** For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
> **4:15** For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
> **4:16** For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
> **4:17** Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
> **4:18** Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

**Key connection:** "so shall we ever be with the Lord" (4:17) -- the endEmeO "being at home with the Lord" of 2 Cor 5:8 finds its mechanism here: being caught up at the resurrection/second coming.

## Death-State Passages (OT)

### Psalm 6:5
> For in death [there is] no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?

### Psalm 88:10-12
> **88:10** Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise [and] praise thee? Selah.
> **88:11** Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? [or] thy faithfulness in destruction?
> **88:12** Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

### Psalm 115:17
> The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.

### Psalm 146:4
> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.

### Ecclesiastes 9:5-6, 10
> **9:5** For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
> **9:6** Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any [thing] that is done under the sun.
> **9:10** Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do [it] with thy might; for [there is] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.

### Isaiah 38:18-19 (Hezekiah's Song)
> **38:18** For the grave cannot praise thee, death can [not] celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
> **38:19** The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I [do] this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

**Note:** Isa 38:12 also appeared as a cross-testament parallel for 2 Cor 5:4: "Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent" -- the tent metaphor for the body/life in an OT death context.

### Job 3:13-19 (The Rest of Death)
> **3:13** For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
> **3:14** With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;
> **3:17** There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
> **3:18** [There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
> **3:19** The small and great are there; and the servant [is] free from his master.

### Job 14:11-15, 21
> **14:10** But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where [is] he?
> **14:11** [As] the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:
> **14:12** So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens [be] no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
> **14:13** O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
> **14:14** If a man die, shall he live [again]? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
> **14:15** Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
> **14:21** His sons come to honour, and he knoweth [it] not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth [it] not of them.

## 2 Peter 1:13-15 (Tabernacle Parallel)

> **1:13** Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle [skEnOmati, G4638], to stir you up by putting [you] in remembrance;
> **1:14** Knowing that shortly I must put off [this] my tabernacle [skEnOmatos, G4638], even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.
> **1:15** Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease [exodon, G1841, "exodus/departure"] to have these things always in remembrance.

**Greek parsing:**
- skEnOmati/skEnOmatos (G4638) = related to skEnos (G4636) in 2 Cor 5:1,4
- apothesis (G595) = "putting off/laying aside" -- the "taking down" of the tent
- exodon (G1841) = literally "exodus" -- Peter's word for death

## Cross-Testament Parallel Findings

The strongest NT parallel for 2 Cor 5:8 is **2 Cor 5:6** itself (score 0.541). The next strongest cross-passage parallel is **1 Th 4:17** (score 0.296), connecting "present with the Lord" to "so shall we ever be with the Lord."

For 2 Cor 5:4, the NT parallels point to **2 Cor 4:11** (mortal flesh) and **Rom 8:11** (mortal bodies). The OT parallels connect to **Isa 38:12** (tent metaphor for death).

For 2 Cor 5:1, the OT parallels center on "tent" and "build/building" vocabulary but no single OT passage strongly parallels the full thought.
