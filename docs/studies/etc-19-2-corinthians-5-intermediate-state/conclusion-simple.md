# 2 Corinthians 5 -- Resurrection or Intermediate State?

## What This Study Examined

This study asked: What does 2 Corinthians 5:1-8 actually teach? Is Paul describing a conscious, disembodied existence between death and resurrection -- an "intermediate state" -- or is he talking about the resurrection body? This passage is one of the most frequently cited texts in debates about what happens to believers when they die, so the question matters.

The study examined the Greek vocabulary word by word, the parallel passages in Paul's other letters, and the broader biblical testimony about death.

## What the Text Actually Says

### Paul Does NOT Want to Be "Unclothed"

The pivotal verse is 2 Corinthians 5:4:

> "For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."

Paul explicitly states three things:

1. **Believers groan** under the burden of mortality.
2. **He does NOT wish to be "unclothed"** -- that is, he does not want to die and be stripped of the body.
3. **He wishes to be "clothed upon"** -- to receive the resurrection body on top of the mortal body, without dying first.

If "unclothed" means the intermediate state (being a disembodied soul with Christ), then Paul is saying he does NOT want the intermediate state. This is the opposite of what the passage is commonly cited to prove.

### The Clothing Metaphor Is About Resurrection

Paul uses a unique Greek word here -- *ependyomai* (G1902), meaning "to put on over." It appears only twice in the entire New Testament, both times in this passage. The prefix *epi-* ("upon/over") indicates layering -- putting the heavenly body ON TOP OF the mortal body. Paul had the simpler word *endyo* ("to put on") available to him, a word he uses 29 other times. He deliberately chose the compound form to describe something specific: transformation without death.

This matches exactly what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:51-52:

> "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump."

Some believers will be alive when Christ returns and will be transformed without dying. That is what Paul *wants* -- to be "clothed upon" (transformed while alive) rather than "unclothed" (dying first and then being raised).

### "Mortality Swallowed Up by Life" = Resurrection

The purpose clause in 2 Corinthians 5:4 -- "that mortality might be swallowed up of life" -- uses the same Greek root (*katapino*, "swallow up") as 1 Corinthians 15:54: "Death is swallowed up in victory." The same word, the same concept, the same event: the resurrection transformation when mortality is consumed by immortality.

## "Absent from the Body, Present with the Lord"

This phrase from 2 Corinthians 5:8 is probably the most-quoted line in debates about the intermediate state. But the verse does not say what many assume.

Paul writes: "We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."

Two observations:

1. **Paul does not say "immediately."** The Greek connects "absent from the body" and "present with the Lord" with *kai* ("and"). This does not specify timing. Paul states his preference -- he would rather be with the Lord than continue in mortal life -- without describing the mechanism or interval of the transition.

2. **Paul elsewhere tells us when believers are "with the Lord."** In 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, he writes: "The dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them... and so shall we ever be with the Lord." Being permanently "with the Lord" is placed at the resurrection and second coming, not at the moment of death.

From the perspective of someone who is unconscious in death, there is no subjective gap between dying and being raised. The next conscious experience after closing your eyes in death would be opening them in the presence of the Lord. Paul can speak of "departing and being with Christ" (Philippians 1:23) without requiring a conscious intermediate state, because from the dead person's perspective, the transition is instantaneous -- even if centuries pass objectively.

## The Groaning Is for Bodily Redemption, Not Escape from the Body

Paul says "we groan" in 2 Corinthians 5:2,4. This same word (*stenazomen*, G4727) appears with the same form in Romans 8:23, where what is being groaned for is stated explicitly: "the redemption of our body."

In both passages, the Spirit is the guarantee of this future transformation. In 2 Corinthians 5:5, the Spirit is called the "earnest" (down payment). In Romans 8:23, the Spirit is called the "firstfruits." Both are images of a partial gift guaranteeing a future completion -- the bodily resurrection.

Paul is not groaning to escape the body. He is groaning for the body's transformation.

## The Consistency Check

If a conscious intermediate state were true, several other statements Paul makes would be difficult to explain:

- **1 Corinthians 15:18** -- "Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished." If the dead in Christ are currently in conscious bliss with Christ, Paul could not describe them as "perished" without resurrection. The word *apollymi* means "destroyed, lost, ruined." This only makes sense if the dead are genuinely dead, not consciously with Christ.

- **1 Corinthians 15:19** -- "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable." If believers go to conscious bliss at death, hope extends beyond this life even without resurrection. Paul's argument requires that the resurrection is the ONLY hope.

- **1 Thessalonians 4:13-18** -- Paul comforts the Thessalonians about the dead by pointing to the resurrection, not to the fact that their loved ones are already consciously with Christ. If the dead were already in bliss, why not say so? Why focus entirely on a future event?

## What About the Other "Intermediate State" Passages?

Several other passages are sometimes cited alongside 2 Corinthians 5:8:

- **Luke 23:43** ("Today shalt thou be with me in paradise") -- The Greek has no punctuation. The comma before "today" is an editorial insertion. Jesus himself said on Sunday morning, "I am not yet ascended to my Father" (John 20:17), and Peter says Jesus' soul was in hades between death and resurrection (Acts 2:27,31). Jesus was not in paradise on Friday.

- **Luke 16:19-31** (The Rich Man and Lazarus) -- This is a parable within a series of parables (Luke 15-16). Its climax is "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them." Parables use culturally familiar imagery to make a point; they are not cosmological blueprints.

- **Revelation 6:9-11** (Souls under the altar) -- Apocalyptic symbolism. Abel's blood "cried out" from the ground (Gen 4:10) without Abel being literally conscious. The same literary device is at work here.

## What This Means for the ETC Question

2 Corinthians 5 is sometimes used to argue that the dead are conscious between death and resurrection, which is then extended to argue that the wicked are conscious in eternal torment. But this passage does not teach a conscious intermediate state. It teaches about the resurrection body and Paul's preference for being transformed without dying.

The passage's vocabulary, grammar, and parallel passages all point to the same event described in 1 Corinthians 15:51-54 -- the resurrection transformation at the second coming. Paul's framework is:

- The mortal body is a tent -- temporary and fragile
- The resurrection body is a building from God -- permanent and eternal
- The Spirit is the guarantee that the transformation will happen
- Paul's preference is transformation without death, but his confidence is that whether he dies or is transformed alive, he will be with the Lord at the resurrection

This is consistent with the findings of Studies 01-04, which established from the broader biblical testimony that humans are mortal, death is unconsciousness, and the hope of Scripture is resurrection.

## Conclusion

2 Corinthians 5:1-8 is not about escaping the body to be with Christ in a disembodied state. It is about the resurrection body and Paul's longing for the transformation that will make mortality permanent -- swallowed up by life. The Greek vocabulary confirms this at every point. The parallel passages in 1 Corinthians 15, Romans 8, and 1 Thessalonians 4 confirm it further. And the broader Old Testament testimony about the state of the dead -- unconsciousness, silence, sleep -- is consistent with it.

The passage that is most often cited as evidence for a conscious intermediate state, when read carefully in its own language and context, turns out to be evidence for the resurrection.
