# Bible Study: 2 Corinthians 5:1-8 -- The Clothing Metaphor and the Intermediate State

## Question
What does 2 Corinthians 5:1-8 teach about the intermediate state? Does "unclothed" (ekdysasthai) mean disembodied? What is Paul's actual preference and what does the clothing metaphor mean? Does this passage support conscious existence between death and resurrection, or is Paul expressing preference for resurrection without dying?

**Key finding:** Nave's directly lists 2 Cor 5:1-5 under RESURRECTION and 2 Cor 5:2,8 under DEATH (desired). This places the passage firmly in both the resurrection and death contexts.

**Search 2: "absent from body present with Lord"** -- Lower relevance scores (0.39-0.45), returned LORD'S PRAYER, LORD'S DAY, GODLESSNESS. Not directly useful, confirming this is a specialized passage not well indexed under Nave's broad topics.

**Key findings from CONCLUSION.md files of related studies:**

**etc6-03-biblical-death (CONCLUSION.md):**
- Death defined as reversal of creation: body returns to dust, spirit returns to God, living soul ceases (Gen 3:19; Ecc 12:7; Ps 146:4)
- Death described as "sleep" by 7+ biblical authors
- No verse defines death as "separation of soul from body"
- The "second death" uses the same word (thanatos) as physical death
- 71 explicit statements examined; 16 classified Conditionalist, 0 classified ECT

**etc6-01b-what-is-man (CONCLUSION.md):**
- E049: "Paul expresses willingness to be absent from the body and present with the Lord; desires to be clothed upon, not unclothed" (2 Cor 5:4,8) -- classified NEUTRAL
- I7: "2 Cor 5:8 and Phil 1:23 teach a conscious intermediate state" -- classified I-B (competing evidence)
- I7 resolution: STRONG toward conditionalist reading. Paul's preference expressions (2 Cor 5:8; Phil 1:23) are "Contextually Clear" while death-as-sleep/cessation passages (1 Thess 4:16-17; Ps 146:4; Ecc 9:5) are "Plain." Plain governs Contextually Clear.
- Key observation: "Paul specifically says he does NOT desire to be unclothed (5:4). His desire is to be 'clothed upon' -- to receive the resurrection body."
- "It cannot be said that 2 Cor 5:8 describes a disembodied intermediate existence."

**etc6-02-who-has-immortality (CONCLUSION.md):**
- E10: "Paul desires to be clothed upon, not unclothed, that mortality (thnetos) might be swallowed up of life" (2 Cor 5:4) -- classified NEUTRAL
- 1 Cor 15:53-54 and 2 Cor 5:4 share vocabulary: thnetos (mortal), katapino (swallowed up). Verified SIS connection (#4a).
- God alone (monos) possesses immortality (1 Tim 6:16). Mortals must "put on" immortality at resurrection.
- No NT passage applies immortality vocabulary to the human soul as an inherent, present possession.
- "The 'put on' (enduo) of 1 Corinthians 15" -- same root as ependyomai in 2 Cor 5:2,4.

### Focus Areas
*(Derived from tool discoveries, not training knowledge)*

1. **The unique vocabulary cluster** -- G1902 (ependyomai), G4636 (skenos), G1553 (ekdemeo), G1736 (endemeo) all occur ONLY in 2 Cor 5. This demands careful in-context analysis rather than importing meaning from parallel passages.

2. **The ependyomai vs. endyo distinction** -- Paul uses ependyomai (to put on OVER, 2x) instead of endyo (to put on, 29x). The compound prefix ep- suggests putting on over something already worn. This may indicate Paul's preference for receiving the resurrection body OVER the mortal body (transformation without death) rather than simple clothing.

3. **The ekdyo / gymnos nexus** -- Paul says he does NOT want to be "unclothed" (ekdysasthai) or found "naked" (gymnos). What does this negative preference mean? Is "unclothed" = disembodied = intermediate state? Or is "unclothed" simply death without resurrection?

4. **The skenos-oikos contrast** -- "Earthly house of this tabernacle" (skenos) vs. "building of God, a house not made with hands" (oikos/oikia). Temporary tent vs. permanent dwelling. Does the "house not made with hands" refer to the resurrection body or to heaven itself?

5. **The connection to 1 Cor 15:53-54** -- Shared vocabulary (thnetos, katapino) links 2 Cor 5:4 to 1 Cor 15:54 ("mortality swallowed up"). Both passages use clothing metaphor for the resurrection. This is a verified SIS connection.

6. **The connection to Rom 8:23** -- stenazo (groan) in both 2 Cor 5:2,4 and Rom 8:23. In Romans 8, the groaning is explicitly for "the redemption of our body" -- the resurrection. Does the same apply in 2 Cor 5?

7. **The ekdemeo/endemeo pairs (5:6-9)** -- Three times Paul contrasts being "at home in the body" with being "absent from the body" / "present with the Lord." Does "absent from the body" mean a disembodied state, or does it function as a euphemism for the transition from mortal to immortal existence?

8. **2 Pe 1:14 parallel** -- Peter uses skenoma (tabernacle) for his body, connecting to Paul's skenos. Nave's lists this under DEATH -- "putting off this tabernacle."

9. **The broader Pauline context (2 Cor 4:14-5:10)** -- The pericope begins at 4:14 with "he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also." The entire passage is framed by resurrection. How does this context govern the interpretation of 5:6-8?

10. **Grammar analysis needed:** Parse the Greek of 2 Cor 5:1-8 verse by verse. Analyze verb moods, tenses, voices. Check textual variants (N1904 vs TR). Examine conditional structures ("if" in 5:1), participle constructions, infinitive preferences.

- Retrieve 1 Cor 15:35-57 (the resurrection body passage)
- Retrieve Rom 8:18-25 (groaning for redemption of body)
