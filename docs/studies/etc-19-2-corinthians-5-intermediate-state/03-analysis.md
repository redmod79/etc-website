# Verse Analysis: 2 Corinthians 5:1-8 and the Intermediate State

## Greek Grammar Analysis of the Clothing Vocabulary

### 1. ependyomai (G1902) -- "clothed upon"

**Morphology:** Aorist Middle Infinitive (ependysasthai) in 2 Cor 5:2 and 5:4. The verb appears only twice in the entire NT, both in this passage.

**The epi- prefix:** The compound structure is epi + endyo. The prefix epi- ("upon/over") modifies the base verb endyo ("to clothe/put on"). This creates a verb meaning "to put on OVER" -- that is, to put a garment on top of clothing already being worn, not to replace one garment with another. Paul had the simple endyo (G1746) available to him, a word he uses 29 times elsewhere in his letters. He deliberately chose the compound form. This lexical choice is significant: Paul is describing putting on the heavenly dwelling ON TOP OF the earthly tent -- transformation without removal of the first garment.

**Does epi- mean "on top of" (layering) or "over" (replacement)?** The compound structure itself answers this. If Paul meant simple replacement, he would have used endyo, which he uses for "putting on Christ" (Rom 13:14; Gal 3:27), "putting on the new man" (Eph 4:24; Col 3:10), and "putting on immortality" (1 Cor 15:53-54). The choice of ependyomai over endyo indicates layering -- receiving the heavenly body over the mortal body, so that the mortal is absorbed/swallowed up by the immortal without an intervening state of nakedness.

**The middle voice:** Wallace (Basics of NT Syntax, pp. 184-187) identifies the indirect middle (benefactive) as the subject acting "for or in" its own interest, and the permissive middle as the subject allowing something to be done to itself. For clothing verbs specifically, Duff (Elements of NT Greek, p. 188) distinguishes: active = "he clothes someone else"; middle = "he clothes himself." The middle voice of ependyomai thus indicates Paul's desire to clothe himself upon, or to receive/allow this clothing upon himself -- it is something Paul wants to undergo.

**John 21:7 -- a related word, not the same word.** John 21:7 uses the noun ependytes (G1903, "outer garment/fisher's coat"), not the verb ependyomai (G1902). Peter "girt his ependytes unto him (for he was gymnos)." While the noun is from the same root family and describes an outer garment put on over existing clothing (or over nakedness), it is a different lexeme. The verb ependyomai remains exclusive to 2 Cor 5:2,4.

### 2. ekdyomai (G1562) -- "unclothed"

**Morphology:** Aorist Middle Infinitive (ekdysasthai) in 2 Cor 5:4. The prefix ek- ("out of") + dyo ("to sink into") = "to strip off, to remove clothing."

**The middle voice significance:** As an aorist middle infinitive, ekdysasthai carries the same reflexive/benefactive force as ependysasthai -- but in the negative direction. "To unclothe oneself" or "to be stripped." However, Paul explicitly says "ou thelomen ekdysasthai" -- "we do NOT wish to unclothe ourselves." The middle voice makes this personal: Paul does not desire this stripping for himself.

**NT usage pattern:** Every other NT occurrence of ekdyo involves violent or involuntary stripping:
- Mat 27:28 -- soldiers stripped Jesus of his garments
- Mat 27:31 -- soldiers took the robe off Jesus
- Mrk 15:20 -- same event
- Luk 10:30 -- thieves stripped the traveler on the road to Jericho

This usage pattern associates ekdyo with forcible removal, loss, and violence. Death as "unclothing" carries these same connotations: it is not a gentle transition but a stripping away.

### 3. gymnos (G1131) -- "naked"

**In 2 Cor 5:3:** "if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked (gymnoi)." Paul uses gymnos to describe the state he wants to avoid -- being found without covering.

**In 1 Cor 15:37:** Paul uses gymnos for the "bare grain" (gymnos kokkos) that is sown in the ground. The bare grain is the seed that dies before receiving its new body from God (1 Cor 15:38: "God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him"). This is the only other Pauline use of gymnos in a theological/metaphorical context. The bare grain is the dead seed -- not a conscious disembodied entity, but the raw material from which God will raise a new creation.

**Significance:** If gymnos in 2 Cor 5:3 carries the same sense as in 1 Cor 15:37, then "naked" refers to the death-state between sowing and receiving the resurrection body -- the state of the bare grain in the ground, not a conscious disembodied soul.

### 4. The Textual Variant in 5:3 -- endysamenoi vs. ekdysamenoi

**The evidence:**
- **N1904 (Nestle/Alexandrian):** "ei ge kai endysamenoi ou gymnoi heurethEsometha" -- "if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked" (7 words)
- **TR (Byzantine):** "eige kai ou gymnoi" -- "if indeed also not naked" (4 words, shorter reading)

The critical variant is between endysamenoi ("having put on/clothed ourselves," from endyo G1746) and ekdysamenoi ("having put off/stripped ourselves," from ekdyo G1562). Some Alexandrian manuscripts read ekdysamenoi.

**If endysamenoi (N1904/majority reading):** "if indeed, having clothed ourselves [with the heavenly dwelling], we shall not be found naked." This reads as a statement of confidence: the condition is that once clothed with the resurrection body, we will not be found in the naked/death-state. The logic flows naturally: Paul desires to be clothed upon (5:2), and affirms that having been clothed, we will not be found naked (5:3).

**If ekdysamenoi (Alexandrian variant):** "if indeed, having been stripped [of the mortal body], we shall not be found naked." This would mean that even after death (being stripped/unclothed), we will not remain in a naked state but will receive the new body. This reading could support a conscious intermediate state (we are stripped but not left naked) OR it could simply affirm that death will not leave us permanently without a body (resurrection will follow).

**Analysis:** The N1904 reading (endysamenoi) produces a more coherent argument: Paul's desire is to be clothed upon (ependysasthai, 5:2), and the affirmation is that having been clothed (endysamenoi, 5:3), we will not be found in the naked/death-state. The ekdysamenoi reading introduces an apparent contradiction with Paul's stated preference in 5:4 ("we do NOT wish to be unclothed"). However, even the ekdysamenoi reading does not require a conscious intermediate state; it can simply affirm that God's purpose in salvation is not to leave believers in the death-state permanently.

**Whichever reading is original, the passage's meaning is governed by the clear statements in 5:4:** Paul does not want ekdysasthai but ependysasthai, and the purpose (hina) is that mortality be swallowed up by life.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### 2 Corinthians 4:14 (Pericope Opening)

**Context:** Paul has been discussing the afflictions of apostolic ministry (4:7-12: treasure in earthen vessels, always bearing about the dying of Jesus). He now states the ground of his confidence.

**Direct statement:** "Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you."

**Key observations:**
- egeiras (Aorist Active Participle) = "the one having raised" -- a completed past act (Christ's resurrection)
- egerei (Future Active Indicative) = "shall raise" -- a future act (our resurrection)
- parastEsei (Future Active Indicative) = "shall present" -- a future act (eschatological presentation)

**Significance:** The pericope opens with resurrection as the controlling horizon. Paul's confidence about death is grounded in the certainty of future resurrection, not in the existence of a conscious intermediate state. Both verbs referring to the believer's future (egerei, parastEsei) are future tense -- these events have not yet happened. The passage that follows (5:1-8) must be read within this resurrection framework.

### 2 Corinthians 4:16-18 (Immediate Context)

**Direct statement:** The outward man is "being destroyed" (diaphtheiretai, Present Passive) while the inward man is "being renewed" (anakainoutai, Present Passive). Paul contrasts "things seen" (temporary/proskaira) with "things not seen" (eternal/aionia).

**Key observations:** The contrast is not between body and soul, but between the visible/temporal and the invisible/eternal. The "things not seen" that are eternal include the "building of God" (5:1) -- the resurrection body. Paul is looking forward to what is unseen and eternal, not to an intermediate disembodied state.

### 2 Corinthians 5:1

**Text:** "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."

**Grammar:**
- ean + kataluthE (Aorist Passive Subjunctive) = 3rd class conditional: "if our earthly tent-house should be destroyed." This presents the dissolution of the body as a real possibility (not merely hypothetical), but not a certainty -- Paul entertains the possibility that some may be alive at the parousia (cf. 1 Cor 15:51: "we shall not all sleep").
- echomen (Present Active Indicative) = "we have." The present tense is striking: Paul says "we have" (not "we will have") a building from God. This has been interpreted as evidence for an immediate post-death heavenly dwelling. However, the present tense can also express certainty of a future promise (the "proleptic present" -- so assured of the future reality that it is spoken of as a present possession). Compare John 5:24: "He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath [echei, present tense] everlasting life" -- yet the full realization of eternal life awaits the resurrection (John 6:40,54).

**The tent/building contrast:**
- skenos (G4636, "tent") -- occurs only here (5:1) and in 5:4. A tent is temporary, portable, easily taken down. Paul's use of skenos for the mortal body emphasizes its fragile, transient nature.
- oikodome (G3619, "building") from God -- permanent, made by God (not human hands), eternal, in the heavens. This contrasts with the earthly tent in every way: permanent vs. temporary, divine vs. earthly, eternal vs. transient, heavenly vs. earthly.
- 2 Pe 1:13-14 uses the related skenoma (G4638) for Peter's body, confirming that the tent/tabernacle metaphor for the mortal body was shared apostolic language.

**Is the "building from God" received at death or at resurrection?** The question is critical. Two observations:
1. In 1 Cor 15:35-44, Paul answers the question "with what body do they come?" The answer is the resurrection body -- sown natural, raised spiritual. The building/dwelling language of 2 Cor 5:1 corresponds to this.
2. The "house not made with hands" (acheiropoietos, G886) echoes Mark 14:58 where Jesus speaks of destroying "this temple that is made with hands" and building "another made without hands." The temple of Jesus' body was raised in resurrection (John 2:19-21). The "not made with hands" building is the resurrection body.

### 2 Corinthians 5:2

**Text:** "For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven."

**Grammar:**
- stenazomen (Present Active Indicative) = "we groan" -- ongoing present state
- ependysasthai (Aorist Middle Infinitive) = "to clothe upon ourselves" -- the desired action
- epipoThountes (Present Active Participle) = "earnestly desiring/longing" -- continuous present longing

**Key connection to Romans 8:23:** Paul uses the same verb stenazomen ("we groan") with the same form (Present Active Indicative, 1st person plural). In Romans 8:23, what the groaning is FOR is explicitly stated: "the redemption of our body" (ten apolytrOsin tou sOmatos hEmOn). The groaning in Romans 8 is specifically for bodily redemption -- the resurrection. The same groaning verb in 2 Cor 5:2 suggests the same object. Paul is not groaning to escape the body; he is groaning for the body's transformation.

**Key connection to Romans 8:23 (continued):** Romans 8:23 also mentions "the firstfruits of the Spirit" (ten aparchen tou Pneumatos), which parallels 2 Cor 5:5's "earnest of the Spirit" (ton arrabona tou Pneumatos). Both the "firstfruits" and the "earnest/down payment" point to the same thing: the present gift of the Spirit guarantees a future consummation -- the redemption of the body.

### 2 Corinthians 5:3

**Text (N1904):** "If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked."

**The meaning depends on the reading (see textual variant analysis above).** Taking the N1904 reading (endysamenoi), the verse affirms: "if indeed, having been clothed [with the heavenly dwelling], we shall not be found naked [in the death-state]." The condition "ei ge" ("if indeed") introduces an expectation that is assumed to hold true. Paul affirms that the heavenly clothing, once received, means no more nakedness/death.

**gymnos as death-state:** In light of Paul's use of gymnos in 1 Cor 15:37 for the bare grain that is sown (dies), "naked" in 2 Cor 5:3 most naturally refers to the death-state -- the state of being without a body, not conscious disembodiment but the condition of the dead who have not yet been raised. Paul wants to avoid this state entirely by being "clothed upon" (transformed while alive) rather than "unclothed" (dying) and then later clothed again.

### 2 Corinthians 5:4 (The Pivotal Verse)

**Text:** "For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."

**Grammar -- the three-part preference structure:**

1. **What Paul does NOT want:** ou thelomen ekdysasthai -- "we do not wish to unclothe ourselves" (Aorist Middle Infinitive). Paul explicitly rejects the state of being unclothed/stripped. If "unclothed" = the intermediate state of conscious disembodiment, Paul is saying he does not want the intermediate state.

2. **What Paul WANTS:** all' ependysasthai -- "but to clothe upon ourselves" (Aorist Middle Infinitive). Paul's positive desire is to receive the heavenly body ON TOP OF the mortal body -- to be transformed without going through death.

3. **The PURPOSE (hina clause):** hina katapothE to thnEton hypo tEs zOEs -- "in order that the mortal might be swallowed up by life." This is the goal: mortality absorbed by life. The word katapothE (Aorist Passive Subjunctive of katapinO, G2666) is the same root used in 1 Cor 15:54: "Death is swallowed up (katepothE) in victory." The shared vocabulary confirms that the same event is in view: the resurrection/transformation when mortality is consumed by immortality.

**The phrase eph' hO ("because/on account of which"):** This causal phrase explains why they groan while burdened. The burden is mortality itself -- the weight of living in a fragile, decaying tent-body. The groaning is not because they want to escape the body, but because they want mortality to be overcome by life.

**Comparison with 1 Cor 15:51-52:** Paul writes to the Corinthians: "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump." Here Paul explicitly contemplates the possibility that some believers will be alive at the parousia and will be transformed without dying ("we shall not all sleep"). The desire expressed in 2 Cor 5:4 -- to be "clothed upon" rather than "unclothed" -- corresponds exactly to this: Paul prefers the transformation-without-death of 1 Cor 15:51-52 to the death-and-resurrection sequence.

**Comparison with 1 Thess 4:15-17:** "We which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep... the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them." Paul envisions two categories: (1) the dead who are raised, and (2) the living who are transformed. In 2 Cor 5:4, Paul places himself in category (2) as his preference -- he wants to be among those who are alive and remain, who receive immortality over their mortality without the intervening nakedness of death.

### 2 Corinthians 5:5

**Text:** "Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."

**Key observations:**
- katergasamenos (Aorist Middle Participle) = "the one having prepared us" -- God is the agent who has prepared believers for this transformation.
- "the selfsame thing" (auto touto) = the very thing described in 5:4 -- the swallowing up of mortality by life.
- arrabOn (G728) = "earnest/down payment/guarantee" -- the Holy Spirit is the deposit guaranteeing the future complete transformation. An arrabOn is a partial payment that pledges the full amount to come. The Spirit now is the guarantee of the resurrection body later.

This verse anchors the passage in eschatological promise, not present experience. The Spirit is the guarantee of something yet to come -- the redemption of the body (Rom 8:23).

### 2 Corinthians 5:6-7

**Text:** "Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)"

**Grammar:**
- endEmountes (Present Active Participle) = "being at home" (en + dEmos, "among one's own people")
- ekdEmoumen (Present Active Indicative) = "we are away from home" (ek + dEmos)

**The at-home/away-from-home metaphor:** These verbs (G1736 and G1553) occur only in 2 Cor 5:6,8,9 -- nowhere else in the NT. The metaphor is of residency: being "at home in the body" means dwelling in the bodily/earthly sphere. Being "away from the Lord" means not being in the Lord's visible, immediate presence.

**What does "absent from the Lord" mean?** Verse 7 provides the explanation: "for we walk by faith, not by sight." The absence from the Lord is not spatial separation but experiential -- we do not yet see the Lord face to face. We relate to him through faith (pistis, G4102), not through sight (eidos, G1491). This is a statement about the current condition of embodied life, not about the body as an obstacle to the Lord's presence.

**Critical observation:** Paul says we are "always confident" (tharrountes pantote) DESPITE being at home in the body and therefore absent from the Lord. The body is not presented as a prison from which Paul longs to escape; rather, the present embodied state is one of faith-based confidence while looking forward to the sight-based presence of the Lord.

### 2 Corinthians 5:8

**Text:** "We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."

**Grammar:**
- tharroumen (Present Active Indicative) = "we are confident"
- eudokoumen (Present Active Indicative) = "we are well-pleased/willing" -- this is stronger than mere willingness; eudokeO indicates positive preference, delight
- mallon (Adverb) = "rather/more" -- comparative
- ekdEmEsai (Aorist Active Infinitive) = "to be away from home from the body"
- endEmEsai (Aorist Active Infinitive) = "to be at home with the Lord"

**Note the shift from middle to active voice:** In 5:2 and 5:4, the clothing verbs are Aorist Middle (ependysasthai, ekdysasthai). In 5:8, the at-home/away-from-home verbs are Aorist Active. The aorist aspect views each event as a whole -- a single, completed transition, not an ongoing process.

**Does this verse REQUIRE a conscious intermediate state?** The verse connects two events with kai ("and"): being absent from the body AND being present with the Lord. The question is whether these are simultaneous or sequential.

The verse does not specify when or how these events relate temporally. Paul states his preference -- he would rather (mallon) be absent from the body and at home with the Lord than continue at home in the body and absent from the Lord. This is a statement of preference between two states, not a theological description of the mechanism of transition.

**The temporal question:** From the perspective of the dead person, if death is unconscious (as the OT consistently describes it -- Ps 6:5; 88:10-12; 115:17; 146:4; Ecc 9:5-6,10), then the very next conscious experience after death would be the resurrection and being "at home with the Lord." There would be no subjective experience of an intervening gap. Paul need not be describing a conscious intermediate state; he may simply be describing the transition from the perspective of subjective experience -- the next thing you know after death is being with the Lord.

**Check against 1 Thess 4:17:** "So shall we ever be with the Lord." This is Paul's definitive statement about WHEN believers are permanently "with the Lord" -- at the resurrection/second coming, when the dead are raised and the living are caught up. Being "with the Lord" in Paul's theology is an eschatological event, not an intermediate state.

### 2 Corinthians 5:9-10

**Text:** "Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."

**Key observations:**
- Verse 9 uses "whether present or absent" (eite endEmountes eite ekdEmountes) without specifying "in the body" or "from the body." The terms are left general -- the focus shifts from the body/Lord contrast to the judgment.
- Verse 10 introduces the judgment seat of Christ (bEma tou Christou). Every person receives according to what was done "in his body" (dia tou sOmatos). The things done in the body determine the judgment. This further reinforces that the body is the theater of moral action, not a prison to escape.
- The judgment seat scene is eschatological -- it corresponds to the parousia, not to an intermediate state.

## Comparison with Philippians 1:21-23

**Text:** "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain... I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ; which is far better."

**Grammar:**
- analysai (G360, Aorist Active Infinitive) = "to depart/loose anchor" -- a different word than ekdEmEsai (2 Cor 5:8). Paul uses a nautical/military metaphor (breaking camp, loosing moorings), not the at-home/away-from-home metaphor.
- syn ChristO einai (Present Active Infinitive with dative) = "to be with Christ" -- present infinitive suggesting ongoing state.

**Does Paul specify WHEN he is "with Christ"?** No. The verse says Paul desires "to depart and to be with Christ" -- two infinitives connected by kai ("and"). Like 2 Cor 5:8, this connects two events without specifying the temporal gap between them.

**The comparison structure in Philippians 1:** Paul is comparing:
- (A) Continued life in the flesh = fruitful labor (1:22)
- (B) Departure = being with Christ = far better (1:23)
- He chooses (A) for the Philippians' sake (1:24-25)

The comparison is between continued earthly life and the state of being with Christ. It is NOT a comparison between intermediate state and resurrection. Paul does not say "I desire the intermediate state." He says "to depart and be with Christ" -- the departure leads to being with Christ, and from the departing person's perspective (if death is unconscious), the next conscious moment after departure IS being with Christ at the resurrection.

**1 Cor 15:18 as consistency check:** Paul writes: "Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished." If the dead in Christ are currently experiencing blissful conscious fellowship with Christ in an intermediate state, how could Paul say they are "perished" (apOlonto, Aorist Middle Indicative of apollymi) without resurrection? The word apollymi means "destroyed, lost, ruined." This statement makes sense only if the dead are genuinely unconscious/dead without hope apart from the resurrection. If they were already "with Christ" in conscious bliss, they could not be described as "perished."

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: The Clothing Metaphor as Resurrection, Not Escape
Every element of the clothing metaphor points to resurrection/transformation, not to escape from the body:
- ependysasthai = putting ON (over), not taking off
- The purpose clause (hina) = mortality swallowed by life (= 1 Cor 15:54)
- The groaning (stenazomen) = same verb as Rom 8:23, where the object is "redemption of our body"
- The earnest of the Spirit (arrabOn) = down payment guaranteeing future bodily transformation

### Pattern 2: Paul's Preference Is for Transformation Without Death
The preference structure in 5:4 aligns perfectly with 1 Cor 15:51-52 and 1 Thess 4:15-17:
- Paul does NOT want to be unclothed (to die)
- Paul WANTS to be clothed upon (to be transformed while alive at the parousia)
- The goal is the same event: mortality swallowed by life / "we shall all be changed"

### Pattern 3: "With the Lord" Is Eschatological
Paul's statements about being "with the Lord" or "with Christ" find their explanation in 1 Thess 4:17: "so shall we ever be with the Lord." The permanent state of being with the Lord begins at the resurrection/parousia, not at an intermediate state.

### Pattern 4: Death as Sleep/Unconsciousness Is Multi-Author Biblical Testimony
The following passages describe death as unconsciousness or cessation of thought:
- Ps 6:5 -- no remembrance in death
- Ps 88:10-12 -- the dead do not praise, the land of forgetfulness
- Ps 115:17 -- the dead praise not the LORD, they go into silence
- Ps 146:4 -- in that very day his thoughts perish
- Ecc 9:5-6,10 -- the dead know not anything, no work, no knowledge, no wisdom in the grave
- Isa 38:18-19 -- the grave cannot praise, death cannot celebrate
- Job 3:13-19 -- the dead are at rest, hear not the voice of the oppressor
- Job 14:12,21 -- man lies down and rises not till the heavens are no more; his sons come to honour and he knows it not
- Dan 12:2 -- those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake
- John 11:11-14 -- Jesus calls death "sleep" and explicitly equates it with Lazarus being dead

This testimony spans Job, the Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Isaiah, Daniel, and Jesus himself. It represents multiple genres (wisdom, poetry, prophecy, narrative), multiple time periods, and multiple authors. Any interpretation of 2 Cor 5 must be consistent with this broad biblical witness.

## Connections Between Passages

### The 2 Corinthians 5 / 1 Corinthians 15 Vocabulary Chain

| 2 Corinthians 5 | 1 Corinthians 15 | Shared Element |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| ependysasthai (5:2,4) | endysasthai (15:53) | Same root endyO, clothing metaphor |
| thnEton (5:4) | thnEton (15:53,54) | "the mortal" -- identical word |
| katapothE (5:4) | katepothE (15:54) | "swallowed up" -- same root katapinO |
| gymnoi (5:3) | gymnos (15:37) | "naked/bare" -- same root |
| stenazomen (5:2,4) | -- | (cf. Rom 8:23 stenazomen) |
| arrabOn tou Pneumatos (5:5) | -- | (cf. Rom 8:23 aparchEn tou Pneumatos) |

These shared vocabulary elements confirm that 2 Cor 5:1-8 and 1 Cor 15:35-57 are discussing the same event -- the resurrection transformation -- not different events (intermediate state vs. resurrection).

### The Romans 8 / 2 Corinthians 5 Parallel

| Romans 8:22-23 | 2 Corinthians 5:2-5 |
|----------------|---------------------|
| stenazomen ("we groan") | stenazomen ("we groan") |
| aparchEn tou Pneumatos ("firstfruits of the Spirit") | arrabOna tou Pneumatos ("earnest of the Spirit") |
| apolytrOsin tou sOmatos ("redemption of our body") | ependysasthai ("to be clothed upon") |
| apekdechomenoi ("eagerly awaiting") | epipoThountes ("earnestly desiring") |

In Romans 8:23, what is being groaned for and eagerly awaited is explicitly "the redemption of our body." The parallel structure in 2 Cor 5 describes the same longing with different vocabulary (the clothing metaphor instead of the redemption metaphor), but the object is the same: the transformation of the body, not escape from it.

## Word Study Insights

### The Unique Vocabulary Cluster

Four words in 2 Cor 5 appear ONLY in this passage in the entire NT:
- ependyomai (G1902) -- 2 occurrences
- skenos (G4636) -- 2 occurrences
- ekdemeO (G1553) -- 3 occurrences
- endemeO (G1736) -- 3 occurrences

This concentration of unique vocabulary means the passage must be interpreted primarily from its own context and from Paul's broader theological vocabulary, not by importing meaning from passages that use different words. The attempt to equate "absent from the body" (ekdEmEsai) with a conscious disembodied state imports a meaning not found in the word itself. The word means "to be away from home" -- it describes departure from the bodily sphere, not the nature of existence after departure.

### The ekdeo / endyo / ependyo Triad

Paul constructs a three-tier vocabulary in this passage:
1. **ekdyo** (G1562) = to strip off, unclothe -- what Paul does NOT want
2. **endyo** (G1746) = to clothe, put on -- the standard clothing verb (used in 5:3 for the participle)
3. **ependyo** (G1902) = to clothe upon, put on over -- what Paul DOES want

The triad reveals Paul's thought structure: his preference is not between body and no-body, but between being transformed (ependyo, gaining the heavenly body over the mortal) and dying (ekdyo, being stripped of the mortal body). The middle option (endyo, simple clothing) appears in 5:3 as the standard resurrection clothing that even the dead receive. But Paul's personal desire is ependyo -- transformation without death.

## Difficult Passages

### Luke 23:43 -- "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise"

This is commonly cited alongside 2 Cor 5:8 as evidence for a conscious intermediate state. However, the passage has its own interpretive issues (the comma placement in "Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise" vs. "Verily I say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with me in paradise"). More significantly, Jesus himself did not go to paradise that day -- he was in the tomb until the third day and told Mary on resurrection morning "I am not yet ascended to my Father" (John 20:17). Whatever "paradise" means in Luke 23:43, Jesus himself was not consciously in the Father's presence on Good Friday or Saturday. This passage does not resolve the 2 Cor 5 question and introduces its own complexities.

### Luke 16:19-31 -- The Rich Man and Lazarus

This parable is sometimes cited for conscious existence after death. However, it is a parable (not historical narrative), uses imagery familiar from extra-biblical literature, and describes conditions that contradict other Scriptures (the dead speaking, seeing, feeling thirst). If taken literally, it describes a visible conversation between heaven and hell with a "great gulf fixed" -- a picture no one takes as literal cosmology. This passage cannot be used to override the consistent OT testimony about the state of the dead.

### Revelation 6:9 -- "Souls under the altar"

The souls of the martyrs cry out. However, Revelation is apocalyptic/symbolic literature. Abel's blood "cried out" from the ground (Gen 4:10), but no one concludes that Abel's literal blood was conscious. The "souls under the altar" use the same literary device -- the testimony of the martyrs cries for justice. This is visionary symbolism, not a description of the intermediate state.

### 1 Corinthians 15:18 -- "Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished"

This verse creates a severe problem for the conscious intermediate state view. Paul argues that if there is no resurrection, the dead in Christ "are perished" (apOlonto). If the dead were currently in conscious bliss with Christ, they could not be "perished" without resurrection. The resurrection is necessary because without it, the dead are genuinely lost -- not because they are suffering, but because they are dead, unconscious, with no hope of future existence. This is consistent with the OT testimony and with the conditionalist reading of 2 Cor 5.
