**KEY:** "For many middle voices (especially the indirect middle), putting the subject in italics would communicate this emphasis. Not infrequently the difference between the active and middle of the same verb is more lexical than grammatical. Sometimes the shift is between transitive and intransitive."

### Result 5: Wallace, Basics of NT Syntax, p.182 [score: 0.480]
"Only in the future and aorist tenses are there distinct forms for the middle and passive voice. In the present, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect tenses, the middle and passive forms are identical."

### Result 6: Machen, NT Greek For Beginners, p.68 [score: 0.466]
"Usually the force of the middle is much more subtle. Sometimes, therefore, it is impossible to make any difference in an English translation between active and middle. In the case of some verbs, the difference in meaning is so great that in an English translation a totally different word must be used."

### Result 7: Wallace, Basics of NT Syntax, p.187 [score: 0.462]
**KEY - Permissive Middle:** "The subject allows something to be done for or to himself or herself. This usage, though rare, involves some exegetically important texts. A good 'rough and ready' test is to translate the verb as a passive. If this makes sense--and if the notion of permission is appropriate--the permissive middle is possible."

### Result 8: Wallace, Basics of NT Syntax, p.186 [score: 0.451]
**KEY - Indirect Middle (Benefactive/Dynamic Middle):** "The subject acts for (or sometimes by) himself or herself, or in his or her own interest. The subject thus shows a special interest in the action of the verb. This is a common use of the middle."

## Summary of Key Grammar Findings for 2 Cor 5 Analysis

1. **Middle voice infinitives** (ependysasthai, ekdysasthai): The middle voice indicates the subject acts upon or for itself. Wallace's "indirect middle" (benefactive) -- the subject acts in their own interest. For clothing verbs specifically, the middle = "to clothe oneself" (Duff p.188).

2. **Third class conditional** (ean + aorist passive subjunctive in 5:1): Presents the condition as a real possibility but not a certainty. "If our earthly tent should be destroyed" -- not asserting that it will be, but considering the possibility.

3. **Aorist infinitives** (ekdysasthai, ependysasthai in 5:4): Aorist aspect presents the action as a whole, without emphasis on process. These are constative/summary aorists -- viewing the entire act of being unclothed or clothed upon as a single event.

4. **Permissive middle** (Wallace p.187): Worth considering for the clothing verbs -- "to allow oneself to be clothed upon."
