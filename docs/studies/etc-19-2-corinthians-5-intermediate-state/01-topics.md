## Question
What does 2 Corinthians 5:1-8 teach about the intermediate state? Does "unclothed" (ekdysasthai) mean disembodied? What is Paul's actual preference and what does the clothing metaphor mean? Does this passage support conscious existence between death and resurrection, or is Paul expressing preference for resurrection without dying?

## Topics

### RESURRECTION
Nave's directly lists **2 Cor 4:14** and **2 Cor 5:1-5** under general RESURRECTION scriptures, placing Paul's clothing metaphor passage squarely within the resurrection context.

Typified: Isaac (GEN 22:13 with HEB 11:19); Jonah (JON 2:10 with MAT 12:40)

### DEATH
Nave's lists 2 Cor 5:2,8 under **"Desired"** (by Paul) and 2 Cor 5:1,4,8 under **"Of the Righteous."**

Key sub-entries relevant to this study:

**Miscellaneous subjects -- names for death:**
- "Putting off this tabernacle" -- 2 Pe 1:14 (uses same tent/tabernacle metaphor as 2 Cor 5)
- "Going down into silence" -- Ps 115:17
- "Returning to dust" -- Gen 3:19; Ps 104:29
- "A change" -- Job 14:14
- "Departing" -- Php 2:23

**Called SLEEP:** Deu 31:16; Job 7:21; 14:12; Jer 51:39; Dan 12:2; Jhn 11:11; Act 7:60; 13:36; 1 Cor 15:6,18,51; 1 Th 4:14,15

**Desired by Paul:** 2 Cor 5:2,8; Php 1:20-23

**Of the Righteous:** Includes 2 Cor 1:9,10; 5:1,4,8; Php 1:20,21,23,24; 1 Th 4:13,14; 2 Ti 4:6-8; 2 Pe 1:11,14; Rev 14:13

**Unclassified scriptures (death-state passages):** Ps 6:5; 88:9-14; 115:17; 146:4; Ecc 9:3,5,6,10; Isa 38:18; Job 3:13-19; 14:2,5-12,14,19-21

### IMMORTALITY
General scriptures: GEN 5:24; JOB 14:13; PSA 16:10,11; ISA 25:8; 26:19; DAN 12:2,3; ROM 2:7; 6:22,23; 1CO 15:12-55; 1TH 4:13-18; 2TI 1:9,10; HEB 9:15; 1PE 1:3-5; REV 22:5

Key connection: 1 Cor 15:53-54 -- the "putting on" of immortality uses the same endyO root family as the clothing metaphor in 2 Cor 5.

### SOUL
Nave's cross-references to: SPIRIT; IMMORTALITY; MAN, A SPIRIT; RIGHTEOUS, FUTURE STATE OF; WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF. No independent entry -- this is a pointer topic.

### DEAD (PEOPLE)
**Unclassified scriptures:** JOB 3:13-19; 14:11-15,21; 17:13-16; PSA 6:5; 30:9; 49:15; 88:10-12; 115:17; PRO 21:16; ECC 9:5,6; EZK 32:31; DAN 12:2; LUK 9:30,31; 16:19-31; 20:35,36; 23:43; JHN 11:25

### BURIAL
Figurative: ISA 22:16; ROM 6:4; COL 2:12 (burial metaphor for baptism/regeneration)
"Putting off this tabernacle" under DEATH cross-references 2 Pe 1:14

### GRAVE
General: HOS 13:14; 1CO 15:55 -- Both are victory-over-death passages directly connected to 2 Cor 5's theme.

## Key Observations from Topic Research

1. **Nave's classifies 2 Cor 5:1-5 under RESURRECTION**, not under any "intermediate state" or "disembodied existence" topic. The passage is understood as being about the resurrection body.

2. **2 Cor 5:2,8 appears under "Death -- Desired"** -- Nave's reads Paul's desire as being about the transition from mortal life (not about an intermediate conscious state).

3. **The "sleep" metaphor for death** is attested across 7+ biblical authors (Moses, Job, Jeremiah, Daniel, Jesus, Luke/Acts, Paul) and appears in Paul's own writings (1 Cor 15:6,18,51; 1 Th 4:14,15).

4. **The "putting off tabernacle" language** (Nave's under DEATH) connects 2 Pe 1:14 directly to 2 Cor 5's tent/tabernacle vocabulary.

5. **No Nave's topic for "intermediate state"** or "conscious existence between death and resurrection" exists. This is noteworthy -- the topical dictionary does not treat this as a biblical topic.
