# PROMPT — etc5-15: The Strongest Biblical Case for ECT
## Series: ETC5 — The Final Fate of the Wicked (Study 15 of 18)
## Date: 2026-02-19

---

## Central Question

**"What is the strongest biblical case for Eternal Conscious Torment? Assemble the best ECT arguments from the biblical text: (1) Rev 14:9-11 torment for ever — human worshippers; (2) Rev 20:10 tormented day and night for ever — explicit subjects; (3) Mat 25:46 everlasting punishment — same adjective as eternal life; (4) Mat 25:41 everlasting fire — prepared for devil and his angels; (5) Mark 9:43-48 — worm dieth not, fire not quenched; (6) Dan 12:2 — everlasting contempt, parallel to everlasting life; (7) Luke 16:23-24 — rich man in torment; (8) Isa 66:24 — worm and fire (quoted by Jesus 3x in Mark 9). Evaluate each argument: does it prove ECT at the E or N tier, or only at the I tier?"**

## Purpose of This Study

This study assembles the strongest possible biblical case for ECT and evaluates each argument using the E/N/I methodology. The investigator's role is to determine what tier each argument reaches — not to advocate for or against ECT.

## The 8 ECT Arguments to Evaluate

### Argument 1: Rev 14:9-11 — Torment of Beast-Worshippers
**ECT Claim:** Human worshippers of the beast are "tormented with fire and brimstone" and the "smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" — explicit torment language applied to human beings.

**Key verses:** Rev 14:9-11
**Relevant prior master items:** E150 (ECT), IB008 (Moderate AGAINST universal extension), IB009 (Strong toward permanent desolation), IB014 (Moderate toward judgment-process)

### Argument 2: Rev 20:10 — Tormented Day and Night For Ever
**ECT Claim:** The devil, beast, and false prophet are explicitly "tormented day and night for ever and ever" — the most direct torment-forever formula in the Bible.

**Key verses:** Rev 20:10
**Relevant prior master items:** E149 (ECT), IB015 (Moderate), E212 (Neutral — same formula withheld from human wicked in v.15)

### Argument 3: Mat 25:46 — Everlasting Punishment (Same Adjective as Eternal Life)
**ECT Claim:** Kolasis aionion (everlasting punishment) uses the same adjective (aionios) as zoe aionion (eternal life). If life is endless, so is punishment.

**Key verses:** Mat 25:46
**Relevant prior master items:** E119 (Neutral — grammatical observation), E208 (Neutral — both A-ASF), E209 (Neutral — kolasis not basanismos), IB012 (Moderate toward referent-nature)

### Argument 4: Mat 25:41 — Everlasting Fire Prepared for Devil and His Angels
**ECT Claim:** The fire is "everlasting" (pyr aiōnion) — and humans are sent INTO it; Rev 20:10 shows the devil is tormented therein.

**Key verses:** Mat 25:41
**Relevant prior master items:** E118 (Neutral), E214 (Neutral — hetoimasmenon for devil), IB016 (Moderate AGAINST universal extension)

### Argument 5: Mark 9:43-48 — Worm Dieth Not / Fire Not Quenched (3x)
**ECT Claim:** The three-fold refrain "where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched" describes an ongoing state of undying worm and unquenched fire — implying perpetual conscious existence.

**Key verses:** Mark 9:43-48 (also vv.44,46 repeat the refrain)
**Source text:** Isa 66:24 (confirmed: Mark 9:48 hybrid score 0.424 for Isa 66:24)
**Relevant prior master items:** E141 (Neutral — objects are pigrê = corpses), E144 (Neutral — direct quote of Isa 66:24), IB009 (Strong)

### Argument 6: Dan 12:2 — Everlasting Contempt Parallel to Everlasting Life
**ECT Claim:** "Some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" — the grammatical symmetry implies both outcomes have the same duration; if life is endless, contempt is endless.

**Key verses:** Dan 12:2
**Relevant prior master items:** E023 (Neutral), IB011 (Moderate toward referent-nature), E193 (Neutral — dir'on appears only in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24)

### Argument 7: Luke 16:23-24 — Rich Man in Torment
**ECT Claim:** The rich man is conscious, in flame, requesting water — explicit post-mortem conscious suffering.

**Key verses:** Luke 16:19-31
**Relevant prior master items:** E123 (ECT), IB006 (Moderate toward parabolic/literary genre)

### Argument 8: Isa 66:24 — Worm and Fire (Source Text for Mark 9)
**ECT Claim:** The worm "shall not die" and the fire "shall not be quenched" — present tense expressions suggesting ongoing, unending activity; this is the source text Jesus references.

**Key verses:** Isa 66:24
**Relevant prior master items:** E141 (Neutral — pigrê = corpses), IB009 (Strong), E271 (Neutral — new creation context)

## What the Analysis Agent Must Determine

For each of the 8 ECT arguments, apply the tier-classification test:

**E tier:** Does the text directly state ECT? (Both sides must acknowledge this as direct ECT proof — it cannot be read otherwise.)

**N tier:** Does ECT necessarily follow from this text? (Universal agreement test: would an opposing scholar necessarily agree? No-interpretation-required test: is ECT the only possible meaning? Zero-added-concepts test: nothing external added?)

**I-B tier:** Does the text offer genuine competing evidence — some force toward ECT, but also a legitimate alternative reading that the text itself supports?

**I-A tier:** ECT reading is reasonable inference that extends from E/N statements and aligns with them, but requires systematizing.

**I-D tier:** ECT reading requires concepts not in the text; the text's surface meaning points elsewhere.

**After classifying all 8 arguments:** Produce a synthesis showing how many reach E, N, I-B, I-A, or I-D tier, and what new evidence items (if any) need to be added to the master file.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not re-add items already in the master evidence file
- Do not advocate for either ECT or conditionalism — report only what tier the evidence reaches
- Do not use editorial language ("strongest argument," "most compelling," etc.)
- Do not cite non-etc5 studies
