## etc5-15: The Strongest Biblical Case for ECT
## Series: ETC5 — The Final Fate of the Wicked (Study 15 of 18)
## Date: 2026-02-19

---

## Investigative Framework

This study applies the E/N/I methodology to the 8 strongest ECT arguments from the biblical text. For each argument, the investigation determines what tier the argument reaches: E (explicit proof), N (necessary implication), I-B (competing evidence), I-A (evidence-extending inference), or I-D (counter-evidence external). The investigator does not advocate for either ECT or conditionalism; the task is to classify what each argument actually establishes.

Prior master evidence (374 items through etc5-14) is drawn upon. Items already in the master file are cited by ID; new items are proposed where they do not yet exist.

## Argument 1: Rev 14:9-11 — "Tormented With Fire and Brimstone... Smoke Ascending For Ever and Ever"

### The ECT Claim

Beast-worshippers — human persons — are stated to be "tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb" (Rev 14:10). The "smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" (Rev 14:11). The subjects are human (those who receive the mark). This is the NT text most directly applying torment-forever language to human beings.

### What the Text Says

- Rev 14:9 defines the subjects: "If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand"
- Rev 14:10: "he shall be tormented [basanisthēsetai — G928, Fut Pass Ind 3S] with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb"
- Rev 14:11: "the smoke [kapnos — N-NSM] of their torment [basanismou — G929, N-GSM] ascendeth up [anabainei — V-PAI-3S] for ever and ever [eis aiōnas aiōnōn]; and they have no rest [anapausin — G372, N-ASF negated] day nor night"

**E150 already established (Neutral, reclassified from ECT in etc5-18 audit):** This is explicit evidence recording torment language applied to human persons ("any man who worships the beast").

**IB009 (Strong) already established:** The formula "smoke ascending for ever and ever" draws from Isa 34:10 (tool-confirmed #1 OT parallel, score 0.401) — Edom's desolation, a permanently abandoned wasteland. Rev 19:3 uses the grammatically identical formula (same author, same book) for Babylon = "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21). The formula describes permanent, irrevocable destruction, not ongoing conscious perpetual experience of the subjects.

**IB014 (Moderate) already established:** "No rest day nor night" is the identical phrase used for the four living creatures' ceaseless worship in Rev 4:8 (same author, same book). The phrase describes unceasing activity, not necessarily ongoing conscious suffering.

**IB008 (Moderate) already established:** The subjects are a specific defined class (beast-worshippers with the mark) — not a universal extension to all human wicked.

### Tier Assessment

The text at Rev 14:10-11 explicitly applies torment language (basanizō, basanismos) to human beast-worshippers. E150 is an E-tier observation (reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit — the text applies torment vocabulary to this specific human class; both sides must acknowledge what the text says).

However, three established I-B items address the ECT inference drawn FROM this explicit fact:
1. IB009 (Strong): The smoke-for-ever formula cannot be read as necessarily implying ongoing conscious perpetual experience — Rev 19:3 demonstrates within the same book that it describes completed permanent destruction.
2. IB014 (Moderate): "No rest day nor night" describes unceasing process character, not necessarily perpetual ongoing consciousness.
3. IB008 (Moderate): The language applies to a specific tribulation class, not universally to all human wicked.

**Tier reached for the ECT argument from Rev 14:9-11:**
- The text itself is **E-tier evidence** (E150, reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit) — torment of human beast-worshippers is explicit.
- The ECT INFERENCE that this proves ongoing eternal conscious torment for the duration described is **I-B (competing evidence)** — the IB009 Strong resolution governs the smoke-formula.
- The argument does not reach **N tier** for ECT because: (a) the formula demonstrably can describe permanent completed destruction (IB009 Strong); (b) the subjects are a specific class, not humanity generally (IB008); (c) "no rest" phrase demonstrates alternative valid reading (IB014).

**No new evidence items needed for this argument.** All covered by E150, IB008, IB009, IB014.

## Argument 2: Rev 20:10 — "Tormented Day and Night For Ever and Ever"

### The ECT Claim

The devil, beast, and false prophet are explicitly stated to be "tormented [basanisthēsontai — V-FPI-3P] day and night for ever and ever." This is the most direct torment-forever statement in the NT. The torment verb (not merely a smoke noun) directly carries the for-ever formula for three named subjects.

### What the Text Says

- Rev 20:10: "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented [basanisthēsontai — Future Passive Indicative, 3rd Plural] day and night for ever and ever [eis tous aiōnas tōn aiōnōn]."
- The three named subjects: diabolos (devil), thērion (beast), pseudoprophētēs (false prophet).
- Rev 20:15 (same passage, next sentence): "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." — No torment formula repeated for human wicked.

**E149 already established (Neutral, reclassified from ECT in etc5-18 audit):** The three named entities are explicitly described as tormented for ever.

**E212 already established (Neutral):** The torment formula is applied in v.10 to three named supernatural/apocalyptic entities and is not repeated in v.15 for the generic human wicked — same author, adjacent verses, same lake.

**IB015 (Moderate) already established:** The for-ever formula applied to the active torment verb at Rev 20:10 is assessed as Moderate toward permanent/irrevocable judgment of specific supernatural entities. IB009's within-book demonstration (Rev 19:3) prevents Strong ECT resolution even here; but the direct-verb application (vs. smoke-noun) prevents Strong Conditionalist resolution.

### Tier Assessment

The text explicitly states torment for the three named entities. E149 is an E-tier observation (reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit).

The ECT inference that this proves ongoing eternal conscious torment is **I-B (competing evidence — IB015, Moderate)**. The reasons the argument does not reach N tier:
1. Universal agreement test fails: A conditionalist scholar can read "tormented for ever" as the formula describing permanent, irrevocable judgment of supernatural entities without specifying perpetual conscious experience — IB009's within-book demonstration shows the formula can describe completed permanent judgment.
2. No-interpretation-required test fails: The formula's scope is interpreted differently by the two positions. IB015 (Moderate) establishes that choosing between the permanent-destruction reading and the perpetual-conscious-experience reading is an inference step.
3. The subjects are three named supernatural/apocalyptic entities — not human beings. Whether their mode of existence post-judgment is identical to mortal humans is an additional inference step.

**The argument does not reach E tier FOR ECT for all human persons** because the text names specific supernatural entities, not humanity generally.

**No new evidence items needed.** Covered by E149, E212, IB015.

## Argument 3: Mat 25:46 — "Everlasting Punishment" (Same Adjective as "Eternal Life")

### The ECT Claim

The same adjective (aionios) modifies both "punishment" for the wicked and "life" for the righteous in the same verse. If eternal life is endless, everlasting punishment must also be endless — the grammatical symmetry demands it.

### What the Text Says

- Mat 25:46: "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment [kolasis aionion — G2851 + G166, both A-ASF]: but the righteous into life eternal [zōēn aiōnion — G2222 + G166, both A-ASF]."
- The adjective: aionios (G166) = A-ASF in both instances (E208).
- The punishment noun: kolasis (G2851) = punitive/penal infliction from kolazo (to prune/punish) — NOT basanismos (torment) (E209).

**E119 already established (Neutral):** Same adjective modifies both outcomes.
**E208 already established (Neutral):** Both aionion instances are A-ASF — morphologically identical.
**E209 already established (Neutral):** The noun is kolasis (penal character) not basanismos (torment).

**IB012 (Moderate) already established:** Whether the same adjective imposes the same duration on both outcomes is an I-B inference requiring interpretation. Resolution: Moderate toward referent-nature interpretation (N034 — duration determined by nature of the referent). If the punishment's nature is destruction/cessation, aionios describes the permanent, irreversible character of that destruction. If the punishment's nature is ongoing conscious suffering, aionios describes its endless duration.

### Tier Assessment

The grammatical symmetry (same adjective modifying both outcomes) is an E-tier fact (E208). The ECT argument that "same adjective = same duration = if life is endless, punishment must be endless" is:

- **Not E tier for ECT** — the text states the same adjective; it does not state "the duration of punishment is identical to the duration of life."
- **Not N tier for ECT** — the argument fails the no-interpretation-required test. The adjective aionios inherits the semantic range of olam/aion — its duration is determined by the referent (N034, N035). Reading the adjective as necessarily imposing identical duration requires adding the interpretive step "same adjective = same duration mechanism."
- **I-B (competing evidence — IB012, Moderate):** The symmetry is genuine evidence that has some force toward ECT (if aionios means "endless" for life, it presumably means "endless" for punishment) while the referent-nature principle (N034, N035) provides a legitimate competing reading.

**The ECT argument from Mat 25:46 reaches I-B tier.** The strongest grammatical observation (same adjective, same form) is E-tier neutral; the duration inference is I-B.

**No new evidence items needed.** Covered by E119, E208, E209, IB012.

## Argument 4: Mat 25:41 — "Everlasting Fire, Prepared for the Devil and His Angels"

### The ECT Claim

The fire is pyr aiōnion — everlasting fire. Human sinners are sent into this fire at the Last Judgment. Rev 20:10 shows the devil is tormented in the lake of fire for ever. Therefore, the "everlasting fire" prepared for the devil is a place of endless torment, and humans sent into the same fire share the devil's fate.

### What the Text Says

- Mat 25:41: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire [pyr to aiōnion — N-ASN + A-ASN], prepared [hetoimasmenon — V-RPP-ASN = Perfect Passive Participle] for the devil [tō diabolō — A-DSM = Dative of purpose] and his angels."
- The fire was prepared FOR the devil and his angels (dative of purpose, E214).
- The fire is pyr aiōnion (everlasting fire) — the same adjective phrase as used in Jude 1:7 for the eternal fire on Sodom/Gomorrah (E147).

**E118 already established (Neutral):** The everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels.
**E214 already established (Neutral):** Hetoimasmenon (Perfect Passive Participle) confirms already-prepared state; tō diabolō = dative of purpose.
**IB009-resolved (formerly N029, reclassified N→I-B) already established:** Eternal fire on Sodom = ashes (2 Pet 2:6; Jude 1:7) — demonstrating aionios fire = permanent result, not ongoing burning process.
**IB016 (Moderate, AGAINST universal extension) already established:** The inference that same-location = same-experience for humans and supernatural entities requires an inference step that the adjacent text of Rev 20:15 does not support.

### Tier Assessment

The text states: (a) everlasting fire exists; (b) it was prepared for the devil and his angels; (c) humans are sent into it.

The ECT argument requires two inference steps: (1) aionios fire = endless ongoing process (IB009-resolved (formerly N029, reclassified N→I-B) already establishes aionios fire = ashes on Sodom — i.e., permanent result not ongoing process); (2) same fire = same experience for humans as for the devil (IB016, Moderate weight AGAINST).

- **Not E tier for ECT:** The text states the fire is everlasting and that humans are sent into it prepared for the devil. It does not state that humans experience ongoing conscious torment in it.
- **Not N tier for ECT:** Two inference steps are required that fail the no-interpretation-required test: the aionios qualifier requires interpretation (IB009-resolved (formerly N029, reclassified N→I-B) vs. endless-process reading), and the same-location inference requires adding a concept the adjacent text withholds (E212, IB016).
- **I-B (competing evidence — IB016, Moderate):** The fire's connection to the devil's named fate (E149: tormented for ever; reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit) provides some force toward ECT for human persons who enter it; the differentiated vocabulary in the adjacent passage (E212: torment formula applied to supernatural entities, withheld from human wicked) provides the competing evidence.

**The ECT argument from Mat 25:41 reaches I-B tier.** Specifically, it is IB016 (already established), Moderate weight AGAINST universal extension of torment experience to human wicked.

**No new evidence items needed.** Covered by E118, E214, IB009-resolved (formerly N029, reclassified N→I-B), IB016, E212.

## Argument 5: Mark 9:43-48 — "Their Worm Dieth Not, Fire Not Quenched" (3x)

### The ECT Claim

The three-fold refrain "where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44,46,48) describes an ongoing state: the worm does not die (present tense = permanent ongoing existence), the fire is not quenched (present tense = perpetually burning). This characterizes gehenna as a place where the condemned exist in a state of ongoing conscious suffering.

### What the Text Says

- Mark 9:43: "into the fire that never shall be quenched [eis to pyr to asbeston — G762]"
- Mark 9:44,46,48: "Where their worm [ho skolex — N-NSM] dieth not [ou teleutai — V-PAI-3S], and the fire [to pyr — N-NSN] is not quenched [ou sbennytai — V-PPI-3S]."
- The refrain is a direct quotation of Isaiah 66:24 (tool-confirmed: hybrid score 0.424, top OT parallel for Mrk 9:48).
- Isaiah 66:24: "And they shall go forth, and look upon the **carcases** [pigrê — H6297] of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh."

**E141 already established (Neutral):** The objects of the worm and fire in Isa 66:24 are pigrê (H6297 = corpses/dead bodies).
**E144 already established (Neutral):** Mark 9:48's refrain is a direct quotation of Isa 66:24 (tool-verified, score 0.424).
**E271 already established (Neutral):** Isa 66:24 is set in the new creation context (new heavens and earth, v.22; universal worship, v.23); the righteous go forth to look upon pigrê (dead bodies of transgressors).
**IB009 (Strong) already established:** The formula describes permanent desolation — the fire and worm act on corpses without ceasing until their work is done.

### The Present-Tense Argument

The ECT reading emphasizes that "dieth not" (ou teleutai, V-PAI-3S = Present Active Indicative) and "is not quenched" (ou sbennytai, V-PPI-3S = Present Passive Indicative) are present-tense verbs — suggesting an ongoing present state. The conditionalist reading: the present tense in both Greek and Hebrew describes the characteristic state of the fire and worm — they do not cease before completing their work. The objects are corpses; the present tense describes the fire and worm as active and effective, not as eternally ongoing after the corpses are consumed.

### Assessment of Whether a New I-B Is Needed

**IB009 (Strong)** already addresses the "worm and fire" formula in the context of Isa 66:24 → Rev 14:11. Does the specific argument about "worm dieth not" in Mark 9 require a separate I-B item beyond IB009?

The key question is whether the present-tense refrain in Mark 9:44,46,48 constitutes a distinct argument from what IB009 already covers. IB009 was established in the context of the smoke-ascending-for-ever formula in Rev 14:11/Rev 19:3. The Mark 9 argument is about the worm-and-fire refrain itself.

However, the source text for both is Isa 66:24. E141 already establishes the objects as corpses. E144 establishes the quotation relationship. IB009 (Strong) already classifies the "worm dieth not / fire not quenched" formula as pointing toward permanent desolation. No additional I-B is needed for the Mark 9 argument beyond what IB009 covers.

**New item proposed: E282 — the specific present-tense observation about Mrk 9:48**

E282 (New — Neutral): In Mark 9:48, the verbs describing the worm ("dieth not" = ou teleutai, V-PAI-3S = Present Active Indicative, 3rd Singular) and the fire ("is not quenched" = ou sbennytai, V-PPI-3S = Present Passive Indicative, 3rd Singular) are both present-tense forms. In the source text (Isa 66:24, tool-confirmed top OT parallel, score 0.424), the same formula applies to pigrê (H6297 = corpses/dead bodies, E141). Both sides acknowledge these grammatical facts.

### Tier Assessment

- **Not E tier for ECT:** The text presents the present-tense refrain. The source text (Isa 66:24, tool-confirmed) applies the refrain to corpses. The argument that "dieth not" implies ongoing conscious existence requires adding the premise "the subject being consumed by the worm is conscious" — which the source text does not specify and which the "carcases" (pigrê) of Isa 66:24 explicitly contradict.
- **Not N tier for ECT:** Would fail the universal-agreement test — a conditionalist scholar can read the present-tense refrain as describing the worm and fire as effective on corpses (the objects named in the source text), without any inference of ongoing conscious experience. The phrase "their worm dieth not" means the worm does not cease until its work is done — not that a conscious person exists eternally.
- **I-B (competing evidence — IB009, Strong toward desolation):** The refrain is genuine biblical language that has some prima facie force toward ECT (ongoing activity described in present tense), while the source text (Isa 66:24 — corpses as objects) and the within-book demonstration (IB009) provide the competing evidence. IB009 is already resolved STRONG.

**The ECT argument from Mark 9:43-48 reaches I-B tier (IB009, Strong weight toward desolation).**

**New item to add:** E282 (the present-tense morphological observation about Mrk 9:48 verbs).

## Argument 6: Dan 12:2 — "Everlasting Contempt" (Parallel to "Everlasting Life")

### The ECT Claim

"Some to everlasting life [chayyê olam], and some to shame and everlasting contempt [dir'on olam]." The grammatical symmetry is exact: the same temporal modifier (olam) governs both outcomes. If everlasting life means endless conscious existence for the righteous, everlasting contempt must mean endless conscious existence for the wicked.

### What the Text Says

- Dan 12:2: "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life [chayyê olam], and some to shame [cherphah] and everlasting contempt [dir'on olam]."
- The two terms: chayyê olam = everlasting life; dir'on olam = everlasting contempt.
- Dir'on (H1860) appears only in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24 in all of Scripture (E193).
- In Isa 66:24, dir'on is what "all flesh" has TOWARD the corpses (pigrê) of transgressors.

**E023 already established (Neutral):** The grammatical parallel: some to everlasting life, some to shame and everlasting contempt.
**E193 already established (Neutral):** Dir'on appears only in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24; in Isa 66:24, the objects are pigrê (corpses).
**IB011 (Moderate) already established:** Whether the grammatical symmetry requires identical duration for both outcomes is an inference requiring interpretation. Resolved Moderate toward referent-nature interpretation.

### The Dir'on Analysis (New for this study)

The word dir'on (H1860) denotes an attitude of abhorrence or loathing. In its only other biblical occurrence (Isa 66:24), it describes the attitude held BY observers ("all flesh") TOWARD the corpses on display. The contempt is the experience of the observers, not the experience OF the condemned.

This is a significant lexical observation: the "everlasting contempt" of Dan 12:2 may describe the attitude of all beings toward the condemned after their judgment — not a conscious experience of the condemned themselves. The condemned may be permanently destroyed (as the pigrê of Isa 66:24 are consumed by worm and fire), leaving the permanent legacy of contempt that the universe holds toward them.

This does not establish the conditionalist reading as N tier, because it requires cross-referencing (the connection between Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24 via dir'on, while tool-supported, requires the inference step that the dir'on in Dan 12:2 has the same semantic force as in Isa 66:24). However, it does prevent the ECT reading from reaching N or E tier.

**New item proposed: E283 — the dir'on lexical observation**

E283 (New — Neutral): In Isa 66:24 (the only other biblical occurrence of dir'on beyond Dan 12:2), the dir'on is what "all flesh" has as an attitude TOWARD the pigrê (corpses) of transgressors — it describes the attitude of the observers toward the dead, not a conscious experience of the condemned persons. This is the sole other usage context for the word translated "everlasting contempt" in Dan 12:2. Both sides must acknowledge this lexical fact about the word's only other biblical occurrence.

### Tier Assessment

- **Not E tier for ECT:** The text states "everlasting contempt" using dir'on olam. It does not state that the condemned experience ongoing conscious suffering. The word dir'on (contempt) in its only other occurrence describes the attitude of observers toward corpses.
- **Not N tier for ECT:** The argument fails all three N-tier tests: (a) Universal agreement — a conditionalist can read dir'on olam as "permanent legacy of contempt toward the destroyed wicked" without any ongoing conscious experience of the condemned; (b) No interpretation required — the adjective olam requires contextual determination (N034); (c) Zero added concepts — the argument adds the concept "the condemned experience their contempt consciously."
- **I-B (competing evidence — IB011, Moderate):** The grammatical symmetry (olam for both life and contempt) is genuine evidence that has some force toward ECT; the dir'on lexical data (observer's attitude toward corpses, not experience of the condemned) provides the competing evidence.

**The ECT argument from Dan 12:2 reaches I-B tier (IB011, Moderate toward referent-nature).**

**New item to add:** E283 (dir'on in Isa 66:24 = attitude of observers toward corpses).

## Argument 7: Luke 16:23-24 — "In Hell... Being in Torments... I Am Tormented in This Flame"

### The ECT Claim

The rich man is conscious, in Hades, in flame, requesting water — explicit post-mortem conscious torment. This is a direct narrative description (not a metaphor) of ongoing conscious suffering after death. If the rich man experiences this, the wicked experience it.

### What the Text Says

- Luke 16:23: "And in hell [en tō hadē] he lift up his eyes, being in torments [en basanois — N-DPM = in torments], and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
- Luke 16:24: "Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented [odunōmai — G3600, Pres Mid Ind 1S] in this flame."
- Luke 16:25: "But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things... but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented [odunasai — G3600, Pres Mid Ind 2S]."
- Luke 16:26: "between us and you there is a great gulf fixed"
- Luke 16:28: "lest they also come into this place of torment [ton topon touton tēs basanou]"

**E123 already established (Neutral, reclassified from ECT in etc5-18 audit):** The rich man in Hades lifts up his eyes, is in torments, cries for water, is confirmed as tormented by Abraham. This is explicit torment language for a post-mortem state.

**IB006 (Moderate, toward parabolic) already established:** The passage is introduced using the same literary form as recognized parables ("There was a certain rich man"), placed in a didactic sequence (Luke 15-16) where Jesus uses multiple named parables. The setting is Hades (not the lake of fire, which is the final eschatological state). The contents include elements recognized as figurative: bosom of Abraham, a great gulf, the cooling of flame by a finger-dip of water.

### Tier Assessment

E123 is an E-tier item (reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit): the text explicitly describes conscious torment of the rich man in Hades.

The ECT argument that this proves ECT as the doctrine of the final fate of the wicked requires further inference steps:
1. The parable's depiction of Hades is literal rather than figurative — IB006 (Moderate toward parabolic) challenges this.
2. The intermediate state of Hades depicted here is the same as the final state of the lake of fire — an inference the text does not make.
3. The description of one character in one narrative context establishes the ongoing experience of all wicked persons — requires systematization.

- **Not E tier for ECT as a doctrine of all human wicked:** The text describes one person in Hades in what may be a parabolic/illustrative context. It does not state "all wicked persons experience ongoing torment for ever."
- **Not N tier for ECT:** Would fail the universal-agreement test — conditionalist scholars read this as parabolic illustration consistent with Jewish contemporary cosmology used to make a didactic point, not as a literal description of the final state.
- **I-B (IB006, Moderate toward parabolic):** The explicit torment language (E123, Neutral — reclassified etc5-18) competes with the genre indicators (parabolic/literary) and the intermediate-state vs. final-state distinction.

**The ECT argument from Luke 16 reaches I-B tier (IB006, Moderate).**

**No new evidence items needed.** Covered by E123 and IB006.

## Argument 8: Isa 66:24 — "Worm Shall Not Die, Fire Not Quenched" (Source Text)

### The ECT Claim

The source text Jesus quotes (Isa 66:24) itself describes an ongoing state: the worm "shall not die" and the fire "shall not be quenched." Both present-tense expressions describe perpetual activity, implying the objects are in a state of ongoing destruction — which implies continued conscious existence of those being consumed.

### What the Text Says

- Isa 66:22-24 is set in the new creation (new heavens and earth, v.22; universal worship, v.23).
- Isa 66:24: "And they shall go forth, and look upon the **carcases** [pigrê — H6297] of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die [lo tamuth], neither shall their fire be quenched [lo tikh·beh]; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh."

**E141 already established (Neutral):** The objects are pigrê (corpses/dead bodies — confirmed by H6297 lexical data).
**E271 already established (Neutral):** New creation context; righteous go forth to look upon corpses of transgressors.
**IB009 (Strong) already established:** The formula describes permanent desolation, not ongoing conscious perpetual experience.

### Key Observation: The Text Identifies Its Own Objects

Isa 66:24 does not leave the nature of the objects ambiguous. The Hebrew word pigrê is used — H6297, plural construct of peger, meaning corpse or dead body. The text states: the righteous go and see dead bodies (pigrê); the worm acts on them; the fire acts on them. The objects are explicitly dead bodies, not conscious persons.

The ECT argument requires reading "their worm shall not die" as implying the persons are conscious — but the text specifies the objects as corpses (pigrê). The worm and fire act on dead bodies; the "shall not die" and "not quenched" describe the completeness and thoroughness of the activity, not the perpetual existence of conscious persons.

This is a self-interpreting text: it names the objects. No inference beyond what the text says is needed to identify the objects as corpses. This is an E-tier (Neutral) observation already captured in E141.

### Tier Assessment

The text itself provides the key contextual disambiguator: pigrê = corpses. The worm acts on dead bodies. The "shall not die" and "shall not be quenched" describe the character of the judgment (thorough, complete, irresistible) — consistent with permanent desolation (IB009, Strong).

- **Not E tier for ECT:** The objects of the worm and fire are explicitly corpses (pigrê). The text does not state that the condemned are conscious or that ongoing conscious suffering is occurring.
- **Not N tier for ECT:** The argument fails the universal-agreement test because the text itself identifies the objects as corpses — which does not require conscious experience.
- **I-B (IB009, Strong toward desolation):** Already resolved Strong weight toward permanent-desolation reading. The worm-and-fire formula on corpses is the strongest conditionalist reading, governed by the text's own identification of its objects.

**The ECT argument from Isa 66:24 reaches I-B tier (IB009, Strong weight AGAINST the ECT reading of this text).**

**No new evidence items needed** for this specific argument beyond E141, E271, and IB009. The E283 item proposed under Argument 6 (dir'on = attitude of observers toward corpses in Isa 66:24) extends the analysis.

## Synthesis: ECT Argument Tier Assessment

### Summary Table

| Argument | ECT Claim | Tier Reached | Governing Items |

## ECT Arguments at Each Tier

### Arguments That Reach E Tier (Directly Proving Some ECT-Direction Fact)

Three arguments contain E-tier evidence originally classified as ECT-direction (all reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit):
1. Rev 14:9-11 (E150, reclassified Neutral): Human beast-worshippers are explicitly stated to be tormented with fire and brimstone; smoke of their torment ascends for ever.
2. Rev 20:10 (E149, reclassified Neutral): Three named supernatural entities are explicitly stated to be tormented day and night for ever.
3. Luke 16:23-24 (E123, reclassified Neutral): The rich man in Hades is explicitly in torments, confirmed by Abraham.

**Critical distinction:** These E-tier items establish the textual fact of torment for specific described persons/entities. They do NOT establish, at the E tier, that ALL human wicked experience ongoing conscious torment FOREVER in their final state. The E-tier items are factual observations that both sides must acknowledge; the ECT doctrine of final universal eternal conscious torment for all the wicked is an inference from these facts. The etc5-18 audit reclassified all three from ECT to Neutral on this basis.

### Arguments That Reach N Tier (Necessarily Implying ECT)

**Zero arguments reach N tier for the ECT doctrine** (i.e., that all the wicked experience ongoing eternal conscious torment as their final state). Each argument examined fails at least one of the three stricter N-tier tests:

1. Universal agreement test: No ECT argument passes — conditionalist scholars can provide legitimate alternative readings of each text.
2. No-interpretation-required test: Every ECT argument requires interpreting the aionios adjective, or the formula's temporal scope, or the subjects' identity, or the genre.
3. Zero added concepts test: Every ECT argument requires adding at least one concept the text does not state (universal extension to all wicked; same-duration implication of the adjective; conscious existence implied by the worm/fire formula; etc.).

### Arguments at I-B Tier (Genuine Competing Evidence)

All 8 arguments, when evaluated for the ECT inference they support, land at I-B (competing evidence):

| I-B Item | Direction | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| IB009 | Neutral (both-sides-competing) | **Strong** — toward permanent desolation; governs Rev 14:11 and Isa 66:24 arguments |
| IB015 | Neutral (both-sides-competing) | **Moderate** — toward permanent/irrevocable judgment of supernatural entities; governs Rev 20:10 argument |
| IB012 | Neutral | **Moderate** — toward referent-nature; governs Mat 25:46 argument |
| IB016 | ECT direction | **Moderate, AGAINST** — governs Mat 25:41 argument |
| IB008 | ECT direction | **Moderate, AGAINST** — governs Rev 14:9-11 argument (scope extension) |
| IB014 | ECT direction | **Moderate** — toward judgment-process; governs "no rest day nor night" in Arg 1 |
| IB011 | Neutral | **Moderate** — toward referent-nature; governs Dan 12:2 argument |
| IB006 | ECT direction | **Moderate** — toward parabolic; governs Luke 16 argument |

### Arguments at I-A or I-D Tier

No ECT argument examined in this study reaches I-A tier (evidence-extending inference that aligns with E/N statements from the ECT direction). All compete with established E/N items from the conditionalist direction.

No ECT argument is classified as I-D (counter-evidence external requiring text override). ID001, ID002, ID003 (already established for the immortal-soul doctrine) are not directly engaged by the 8 arguments above, which draw from explicit biblical texts rather than external philosophical frameworks.

## New Evidence Items Proposed

### New Explicit Statements (E)

**E282** (New — Neutral): In Mark 9:48, both verbs of the three-fold refrain are present tense: "dieth not" = ou teleutai (G5053, V-PAI-3S = Present Active Indicative, 3rd Singular) and "is not quenched" = ou sbennytai (G4570, V-PPI-3S = Present Passive Indicative, 3rd Singular). The source text (Isa 66:24, tool-confirmed top OT parallel for Mrk 9:48, hybrid score 0.424) identifies the objects of the worm and fire as pigrê (H6297 = corpses/dead bodies, E141). Both sides must acknowledge the present-tense morphology and the source-text object identification.

**E283** (New — Neutral): In Isaiah 66:24 — the sole other biblical occurrence of dir'on (H1860) beyond Dan 12:2 — the dir'on ("abhorring") is stated as what "all flesh" has as an attitude TOWARD the pigrê (corpses) of transgressors: "they shall be an abhorring [dir'on] unto all flesh." The word describes the attitude of observers toward the dead, not a conscious experience of the condemned persons. Both sides must acknowledge this lexical fact about the word's only other biblical occurrence, as it bears on the meaning of "everlasting contempt" [dir'on olam] in Dan 12:2.

### Summary of New Items

| Proposed ID | Type | Reference | Classification | Description |
|-------------|------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| E282 | E | Mrk 9:48 | Neutral | Present-tense morphology of ou teleutai (V-PAI-3S) and ou sbennytai (V-PPI-3S); source text (Isa 66:24) identifies objects as corpses (pigrê) |
| E283 | E | Isa 66:24; Dan 12:2 | Neutral | Dir'on in Isa 66:24 = attitude of observers ("all flesh") TOWARD corpses — not experience of the condemned |

**No new I-B, I-A, N, or I-D items are needed.** All 8 ECT arguments are already fully addressed by existing I-B items (IB006, IB008, IB009, IB011, IB012, IB014, IB015, IB016). Note: E149, E150, and E123 have been reclassified Neutral in the etc5-18 audit.

## Verification Phase

**Step A — Explicit statements:** E282 directly quotes the morphological parsing of Mrk 9:48 (tool-verified) and notes the source-text connection (tool-verified: score 0.424). E283 quotes the Isa 66:24 text and identifies the grammatical subject of the dir'on clause. Both are what the text says. Both sides must acknowledge them as textual facts. E-tier appropriate.

**Step B — Necessary implications:** No new N items proposed. No existing N items need reclassification. The N-tier tests are applied to each ECT argument and all fail for ECT doctrine at N tier.

**Step C — Source test:** E282 and E283 are both derived from E/N items (E141, E193) and from the direct text. Text-derived items.

**Step D — Direction test:** Neither E282 nor E283 requires any E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value. Both align with and extend existing Neutral items. Neutral classification appropriate.

**Step E — Consistency checks:** No new I items proposed. All I-B items cited are existing and unchanged in resolution.

**Step F — SIS connections:** IB009's Strong resolution (Rev 19:3 within-book demonstration) is the governing #4a SIS connection for Arguments 1, 5, and 8. IB015's Moderate resolution governs Argument 2. IB011/IB012 (referent-nature, N034/N035) govern Arguments 3 and 6. All SIS connections are pre-established and tool-verified or same-author/same-book connections.
