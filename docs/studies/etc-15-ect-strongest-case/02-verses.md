## The 8 Primary ECT Passages

### 1. Revelation 14:6-12 (ECT Argument 1: Human Worshippers Tormented)

**Rev 14:6** — And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,

**Rev 14:7** — Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

**Rev 14:8** — And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

**Rev 14:9** — And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,

**Rev 14:10** — The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

**Rev 14:11** — And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

**Rev 14:12** — Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

*Note: The subject of Rev 14:9-11 is a specific class of tribulation-era persons — beast-worshippers who receive the mark. E150 already established (ECT classification).*

### 2. Revelation 20:7-15 (ECT Argument 2: Tormented Day and Night For Ever)

**Rev 20:7** — And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,

**Rev 20:8** — And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea.

**Rev 20:9** — And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.

**Rev 20:10** — And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

**Rev 20:11** — And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.

**Rev 20:12** — And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.

**Rev 20:13** — And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.

**Rev 20:14** — And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.

**Rev 20:15** — And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

*Note: The subjects of the torment formula in v.10 are "the devil... the beast and the false prophet" — three named entities. V.15 casts human wicked into the same lake without repeating the torment formula. E149, E212 already established.*

### 3. Matthew 25:31-46 (ECT Arguments 3 and 4: Everlasting Fire; Everlasting Punishment)

**Mat 25:31** — When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

**Mat 25:32** — And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep from the goats:

**Mat 25:33** — And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

**Mat 25:34** — Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

**Mat 25:41** — Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

**Mat 25:46** — And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

*Note: v.41 — the fire is pyr aiōnion, hetoimasmenon (Perfect Passive Participle = already-prepared) tō diabolō (dative of purpose = prepared FOR the devil). E118, E214 already established. v.46 — kolasis aionion vs. zoe aionion; both adjectives A-ASF. E119, E208, E209 already established.*

### 4. Mark 9:38-50 (ECT Argument 5: Worm Dieth Not / Fire Not Quenched — 3x)

**Mark 9:42** — And whosoever shall offend one of [these] little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

**Mark 9:43** — And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

**Mark 9:44** — Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

**Mark 9:45** — And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

**Mark 9:46** — Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

**Mark 9:47** — And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:

**Mark 9:48** — Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

**Mark 9:49** — For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.

**Mark 9:50** — Salt [is] good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.

*Note: The refrain in vv.44,46,48 is a direct quotation of Isaiah 66:24 (tool-confirmed hybrid score 0.424). The Greek of v.48: skolex (N-NSM = worm) + ou teleutai (V-PAI-3S = does not die/cease) + pur (N-NSN = fire) + ou sbennytai (V-PPI-3S = is not quenched). E144 already established.*

### 5. Daniel 12:1-3 (ECT Argument 6: Everlasting Contempt Parallel to Everlasting Life)

**Dan 12:1** — And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation [even] to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.

**Dan 12:2** — And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt.

**Dan 12:3** — And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.

*Note: The two Hebrew terms: chayyê olam (everlasting life) and dir'on olam (everlasting contempt). Dir'on appears only in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24. In Isa 66:24, the dir'on is what all flesh has TOWARD the dead bodies (pigrê). E023, E193 already established. IB011 existing.*

### 6. Luke 16:19-31 (ECT Argument 7: Rich Man in Torment)

**Luke 16:19** — There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

**Luke 16:20** — And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,

**Luke 16:21** — And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

**Luke 16:22** — And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;

**Luke 16:23** — And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

**Luke 16:24** — And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

**Luke 16:25** — But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

**Luke 16:26** — And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.

**Luke 16:27** — Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:

**Luke 16:28** — For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

**Luke 16:29** — Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

**Luke 16:30** — And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.

**Luke 16:31** — And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

*Note: E123 already established (ECT: rich man in torments/flame; Abraham confirms). IB006 existing (Moderate toward parabolic). Setting is Hades, not the lake of fire. The narrative is introduced as a didactic parable in the "There was a certain man..." form used for parables (Luk 15:11 same form). No ECT proponent argues the rich man IS literally historical.*

### 7. Isaiah 66:22-24 (ECT Argument 8: Worm and Fire — Source Text)

**Isa 66:22** — For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.

**Isa 66:23** — And it shall come to pass, [that] from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.

**Isa 66:24** — And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.

*Note: The Hebrew word for "carcases" is pigrê (H6297 = corpses/dead bodies). The worm and fire act on dead bodies, not on living conscious persons. E141, E193, E271 already established.*

---

### 8. Isaiah 34:9-10 (Smoke Ascending For Ever — Source Text for Rev 14:11)

**Isa 34:9** — And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.

**Isa 34:10** — It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.

*Note: This is Edom's desolation prophecy. The #1 OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (hybrid score 0.401). E182 already established. After this announcement, Isa 34:11-17 describes wild animals inhabiting the desolation — not ongoing burning of conscious persons.*

## Supporting ECT Passages

**Matt 3:12** — Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

*Note: "Burn up" (katakausei) = consume completely; "unquenchable" (asbesto) = not quenched before its work is done. This is destruction vocabulary, not ongoing-torment vocabulary.*

**Matt 13:42** — And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

**Matt 13:50** — And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

*Note: E260 already established — wailing and gnashing passages use no torment vocabulary, no for-ever formula. Settings are physically incompatible (outer darkness vs. furnace).*

**Revelation 19:3** — And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.

*Note: E250 already established — same formula as Rev 14:11, applied to Babylon = completed destruction. IB009 Strong established from this text.*

**Jude 1:7** — Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

*Note: E147 already established. The same Sodom and Gomorrah are turned to ashes in 2 Pet 2:6. N029 established: eternal fire = permanent result, not ongoing burning process.*

**Hebrews 10:27** — But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.

**Hebrews 10:31** — [It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

*Note: E272, E277 already established — esthiein (G2068 = to eat/devour); no torment vocabulary.*

**Matthew 12:32** — And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the [world] to come.

*Note: The "not forgiven in the world to come" language is sometimes cited for ECT (if unforgiven = ongoing punishment). The text speaks of the unforgiveable sin not being forgiven — not of the mechanism of its consequence.*
