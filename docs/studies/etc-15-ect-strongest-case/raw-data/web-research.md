## Search 2: "Robert Peterson eternal conscious torment arguments"

### Sources
- Robert A. Peterson, *Hell on Trial* (1995, P&R Publishing)
- Peterson & Fudge, *Two Views of Hell* (IVP Academic, 2000)
- Peterson & Morgan, *Hell Under Fire* (Zondervan, 2004)
- Ligonier Ministries article: "Annihilation or Eternal Punishment?" by Peterson
- The Gospel Coalition: "Hell as Endless Punishment"

### Peterson's key arguments:
1. Matt 25:46 parallel: strained to see eternal life as conscious but eternal punishment as cessation
2. Rev 14:9-11: does not speak of consumption but torment
3. Rev 20:10-15: personal beings subjected to everlasting punishment
4. 2 Thess 1:9: olethros = "ruination with full destructive results," not cessation
5. Dan 12:2: parallel structure requires both outcomes to be conscious
6. Historical consensus: Tertullian, Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Wesley, Edwards all affirmed ECT
7. Soul survives death: Luke 23:43,46; Phil 1:22-24; 2 Cor 5:6-9

### Peterson's responses to annihilationism:
- Fire imagery: Revelation passages describe ongoing torment, not consumption
- Destruction/perishing language: "some passages impossible to reconcile with annihilationism"
- Meaning of "eternal": rejects "pertaining to the age" reading for punishment passages
- Soul's survival: charges of pagan origins "ignore" key Scripture passages

## Search 3: "Denny Burk hell eternal torment biblical case"

### Sources
- Burk, chapter in *Four Views on Hell* (Zondervan, 2016)
- Rethinking Hell: "A Response to Four Views on Hell, Pt. 1"
- reforminghell.com series engaging Burk's view (10 parts)
- Credo Magazine: "The Gag-Reflex and the Doctrine of Hell"

### Burk's key arguments:
1. Jesus is the primary teacher on hell — speaks of it as parallel to eternal life
2. Resurrection of the wicked: given bodies "fit for their destiny" — eternal wrath
3. God's infinite holiness: "infinite torments reflect infinite holiness"
4. Historical orthodoxy: 2,000-year majority position
5. Emotional objections ("gag reflex") are unreliable guides to doctrine

### Critical responses noted:
- "Embedded presupposition" that God must punish with ECT — eisegesis charge
- "Scriptural basis far more flimsy than advocates would have us believe"

### Sources
- Multiple articles on Matt 25:46 exegesis from both sides
- forbiddentheology.com, characterofgod.org, tentmaker.org analyses

### Key findings:
- ECT parallel argument: same adjective = same duration for both outcomes
- Counter: kolasis originally = pruning/correction (Aristotle distinction)
- Counter: aionios duration contingent on subject modified
- Counter: "eternal redemption" (Heb 9:12) = completed act with permanent result, not ongoing process

## Search 5: "Mark 9:43-48 unquenchable fire undying worm ECT"

### Sources
- GotQuestions.org, Rethinking Hell, BibleHub commentaries

### Key findings:
- ECT interpretation: undying worm = never-ending conscience torment (Calvin)
- Counter: quotes Isaiah 66:24, which describes dead bodies (peger)
- Counter: "unquenchable fire" in OT temporal judgments (Ezek 20:47; Jer 17:27) means fire finishes its job
- Even ECT scholars acknowledge this is less decisive evidence
