## Rev 14:11 — N1904

Greek Text: καὶ ὁ καπνὸς τοῦ βασανισμοῦ αὐτῶν εἰς αἰῶνας αἰώνων ἀναβαίνει, καὶ οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἀνάπαυσιν ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός οἱ προσκυνοῦντες τὸ θηρίον...

Key parsing:
- καπνὸς (G2586) [N-NSM] — smoke = NOMINATIVE SUBJECT
- βασανισμοῦ (G929) [N-GSM] — torment = GENITIVE ATTRIBUTE ("of torment")
- αἰῶνας (G165) [N-APM] / αἰώνων (G165) [N-GPM] — ages of ages
- ἀναβαίνει (G305) [V-PAI-3S] — goes up = Present Active Indicative
- ἀνάπαυσιν (G372) [N-ASF] — rest = Accusative Singular Feminine (negated)
- προσκυνοῦντες (G4352) [V-PAP-NPM] — worshipping = Present Active Participle, Nom Pl M

Key grammatical fact: kapnos (smoke) is the grammatical subject of anabainei (goes up). Basanismou is genitive (of torment = smoke OF their torment). The smoke ascends for ever — the smoke noun, not the torment verb, carries the for-ever formula.

## Rev 20:10 — N1904

Greek Text: καὶ ὁ διάβολος ὁ πλανῶν αὐτοὺς ἐβλήθη εἰς τὴν λίμνην τοῦ πυρὸς καὶ θείου, ὅπου καὶ τὸ θηρίον καὶ ὁ ψευδοπροφήτης, καὶ βασανισθήσονται ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων.

Key parsing:
- διάβολος (G1228) [A-NSM] — devil = SUBJECT
- ἐβλήθη (G906) [V-API-3S] — was cast = Aorist Passive Indicative (past event)
- θηρίον (G2342) [N-NSN] — beast (nominative, complement of ὅπου = where)
- ψευδοπροφήτης (G5578) [N-NSM] — false prophet (nominative)
- βασανισθήσονται (G928) [V-FPI-3P] — shall be tormented = Future Passive Indicative, 3rd Plural
  - SUBJECTS: devil + beast + false prophet (three named supernatural/apocalyptic entities)
- ἡμέρας (G2250) [N-GSF] / νυκτὸς (G3571) [N-GSF] — day and night (temporal genitives)
- αἰῶνας (G165) [N-APM] / αἰώνων (G165) [N-GPM] — ages of ages

Key grammatical fact: basanisthesontai (V-FPI-3P) directly applies to the three named entities. This is the most direct torment-formula statement in the NT — a torment verb (not a smoke noun) governing the for-ever formula. This is what distinguishes IB015 from IB009: the verb-application vs. the smoke-noun application.

## Mat 25:46 — N1904

Greek Text: καὶ ἀπελεύσονται οὗτοι εἰς κόλασιν αἰώνιον, οἱ δὲ δίκαιοι εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον.

Key parsing:
- κόλασιν (G2851) [N-ASF] — punishment = Accusative Singular Feminine
- αἰώνιον (G166) [A-ASF] — everlasting = Accusative Singular Feminine (first instance, modifies kolasis)
- ζωὴν (G2222) [N-ASF] — life = Accusative Singular Feminine
- αἰώνιον (G166) [A-ASF] — everlasting = Accusative Singular Feminine (second instance, modifies zoe)

Key grammatical fact: BOTH aionion instances are A-ASF — identical morphological form. E208 already established this. The symmetry is genuine. The question of whether the adjective imposes identical duration on both requires interpretation (N-tier test fails: requires choosing between readings — goes to I-B).

## Mat 25:41 — N1904

Greek Text: τότε ἐρεῖ καὶ τοῖς ἐξ εὐωνύμων Πορεύεσθε ἀπ' ἐμοῦ κατηραμένοι εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ αἰώνιον τὸ ἡτοιμασμένον τῷ διαβόλῳ καὶ τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ.

Key parsing:
- πῦρ (G4442) [N-ASN] — fire = Accusative Singular Neuter
- αἰώνιον (G166) [A-ASN] — everlasting = Accusative Singular Neuter (modifies fire)
- ἡτοιμασμένον (G2090) [V-RPP-ASN] — having been prepared = Perfect Passive Participle, Acc Sg N
  - Perfect Passive = completed state: the fire was prepared and remains in that prepared state
- τῷ διαβόλῳ (G1228) [A-DSM] — for the devil = Dative Singular Masculine
  - Dative of purpose/indirect object: prepared FOR the devil
- ἀγγέλοις (G32) [N-DPM] — angels = Dative Plural Masculine

Key grammatical fact: hetoimasmenon (V-RPP-ASN) is a Perfect Passive Participle — already-prepared state. The fire was prepared for the devil and his angels as stated recipients. Human persons are sent into this fire that was prepared for supernatural recipients.

## Mark 9:43 — N1904

Greek Text: ...εἰς τὴν γέενναν, εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ ἄσβεστον.

Key parsing:
- γέενναν (G1067) [N-ASF] — gehenna = Accusative Singular Feminine
- πῦρ (G4442) [N-ASN] — fire
- ἄσβεστον (G762) [A-ASN] — unquenchable = Accusative Singular Neuter

---

## Mark 9:48 — N1904

Greek Text: ὅπου ὁ σκώληξ αὐτῶν οὐ τελευτᾷ καὶ τὸ πῦρ οὐ σβέννυται.

Key parsing:
- σκώληξ (G4663) [N-NSM] — worm = Nominative Singular Masculine (grammatical subject)
- αὐτῶν (G846) [P-GPM] — of them = Genitive Plural Masculine ("their worm")
- τελευτᾷ (G5053) [V-PAI-3S] — dies/ceases = Present Active Indicative, 3rd Singular
- πῦρ (G4442) [N-NSN] — fire = Nominative Singular Neuter
- σβέννυται (G4570) [V-PPI-3S] — is quenched = Present Passive Indicative, 3rd Singular

Key grammatical fact: Both verbs are PRESENT tense — describing the characteristic state of the worm and fire. "Their worm does not die" and "the fire is not quenched" — present tense describes ongoing action. The ECT reading: this is the ongoing state in gehenna for the condemned. The conditionalist reading: this describes the fire and worm acting on corpses (per the source text Isa 66:24) — they do not stop until they have consumed the dead bodies.
