### The 8 ECT Arguments (Steelmanned from Web Research)

**Argument 1: Rev 14:9-11 — Torment with Fire and Brimstone**
- ECT claim: The text explicitly describes conscious torment ("shall be tormented"), explicit duration ("for ever and ever"), and explicit consciousness ("no rest day nor night")
- Peterson: "When the last book of the Bible describes the flames of hell, it does not speak of consumption but says the lost will be tormented"
- This is considered one of the 2-3 anchor texts for ECT

**Argument 2: Rev 20:10 — Tormented Day and Night Forever**
- ECT claim: Personal beings (devil, beast, false prophet) subjected to everlasting torment; humans share same destination (lake of fire); therefore same experience
- Peterson: The "extension argument" — since Rev 20:10 uses identical terms for the lake of fire where humans go (20:14-15), the torment applies to all
- Burk: "Every person is going to be resurrected and given a body fit for their destiny"

**Argument 3: Matt 25:46 — The Parallel Argument**
- ECT claim: Same adjective (aionios) modifies both "punishment" and "life"; if life is conscious and unending, punishment must also be
- Peterson: "It strains the natural meaning of the text to see eternal life as the conscious enjoyment of eternal life forever, but eternal punishment to mean that unbelievers cease to exist forever"
- Widely considered the single most important ECT text

**Argument 4: Mark 9:43-48 — Unquenchable Fire and Undying Worm**
- ECT claim: Fire that is never quenched and worms that never die imply ongoing, unending torment
- Some interpret the "worm" as conscience — Calvin: "pangs of a bad conscience, which is a never-ending torment"
- Even ECT scholars (per Sprinkle) consider this "a bit of a stretch" as standalone evidence

**Argument 5: Luke 16:19-31 — Rich Man in Torments**
- ECT claim: Jesus depicts conscious post-mortem suffering with specific details (flame, thirst, memory, concern)
- Even ECT scholars acknowledge this depicts Hades (intermediate state), not the final hell
- Used more as evidence for conscious intermediate state than for ECT specifically

**Argument 6: Rev 6:9-11 — Souls Under the Altar**
- ECT claim: Disembodied souls are conscious, speaking, aware — proving consciousness after death
- Used primarily to establish the anthropological premise (soul survives death) rather than ECT directly

**Argument 7: 2 Thess 1:9 — Everlasting Destruction**
- ECT claim: "Destruction" (olethros) means ongoing ruin, not cessation; "everlasting" modifies the ongoing state
- Peterson: olethros conveys "ruination with its full, destructive results" rather than annihilation
- Burk: The modifier "eternal" declares its duration

**Argument 8: Dan 12:2 — Everlasting Contempt**
- ECT claim: Parallel with "everlasting life" requires everlasting conscious experience of shame
- Same parallel argument as Matt 25:46: if one outcome is conscious and unending, both must be

### Additional ECT Arguments (Non-Passage-Specific)
- **Theological argument from God's infinite worth:** Sin against an infinite Being warrants infinite punishment (Burk)
- **Resurrection of the wicked:** Bodies raised for eternal experience (Burk)
- **Second Temple Jewish literature:** Preponderance supports ECT reading
- **Historical consensus:** 2,000-year majority Christian teaching
