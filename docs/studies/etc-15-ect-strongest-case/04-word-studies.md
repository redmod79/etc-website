## Greek Word Studies

### G929 — basanismos (Torment Noun)

**Strong's data:** 6 total NT occurrences; 2 unique KJV renderings:
- "torment" (5 occurrences = 83.3%)
- "the torment" (1 occurrence = 16.7%)

**Distribution across Revelation:**
- Rev 9:5 — "torment" of scorpion-sting judgment (explicitly bounded: "five months," vv.5,10)
- Rev 14:11 — "smoke of their torment" (beast-worshippers; IB009 Strong)
- Rev 18:7 — "give her torment" (Babylon — "in one hour" completed event, v.10)
- Rev 18:10 — in context of "in one hour is thy judgment come" (Babylon)
- Rev 18:15 — "fear of her torment" (Babylon — completed event)
- Rev 20:10 — NOT basanismos but basanizō (see below) — the torment VERB

**Critical finding:** G929 (basanismos) appears ONLY in Revelation in the NT. Of the 6 occurrences: (1) one describes a bounded five-month judgment; (3) three describe Babylon's "in one hour" completed judgment; (1) one describes beast-worshippers; (0) none describe the general human wicked. This extends E172 (already established).

### G928 — basanizo (Torment Verb)

**Strong's data:** 12 total NT occurrences; 11 unique KJV renderings including:
- "tormented" (2 occurrences)
- "they should be tormented" / "shall be tormented" / "he shall be tormented" (1 each)
- "to torment," "torment," "tossed" (sea), "toiling" (rowing), "vexed," "pained" (1 each)

**Key morphological note on Rev 20:10:**
Greek: βασανισθήσονται — V-FPI-3P = Future Passive Indicative, 3rd Plural
Translation: "they shall be tormented"
Subjects: devil (diabolos) + beast (thērion) + false prophet (pseudoprophētēs) — three named entities
The for-ever formula: eis tous aiōnas tōn aiōnōn = unto the ages of the ages

**Eschatological uses of basanizō:**
- Rev 9:5 — "should be tormented" (bounded five months)
- Rev 11:10 — "tormented" (the two prophets tormented those who dwell on earth)
- Rev 14:10 — "shall be tormented" (beast-worshippers: E150)
- Rev 20:10 — "shall be tormented" (devil/beast/false prophet: E149)

**Critical finding:** The eschatological torment verb (basanizō) is never applied to the general human wicked in any Pauline epistle, any gospel, or any NT letter outside Revelation. This is an extension of N033 (already established: lexically distinct from destruction vocabulary).

### G2851 — kolasis (Punishment Noun — Mat 25:46)

**Strong's data:** 1 total NT occurrence; 1 KJV rendering: "punishment"

**Greek morphology in Mat 25:46:** N-ASF = Noun Accusative Singular Feminine
**Lemma:** kolasis (G2851) — from kolazo (G2849 = to prune, to punish, to curtail)

**Semantic range:** The word kolazo originally meant "to prune" in agricultural contexts. In classical and Hellenistic Greek, it developed the sense of punitive chastisement or corrective punishment. The noun kolasis designates the penal/punitive character of the outcome, not its mechanism or duration.

**Critical contrast:** The noun used is kolasis (G2851 = penal/punitive infliction) — NOT basanismos (G929 = torment). The choice of kolasis over basanismos means Mat 25:46 specifies the punitive character of the outcome without specifying its mechanism as ongoing conscious torment. E209 already established this fact.

### G762 — asbestos (Unquenchable)

**Strong's data:** 4 total NT occurrences; 3 KJV renderings:
- "never shall be quenched" (2 occurrences)
- "with unquenchable" (1 occurrence)
- "unquenchable" (1 occurrence)

**Occurrences:**
- Mat 3:12 — "unquenchable fire" (burn up the chaff)
- Mrk 9:43 — "fire that never shall be quenched" (gehenna)
- Mrk 9:45 — "fire that never shall be quenched" (gehenna — same verse context)
- Luk 3:17 — "unquenchable fire" (burn up the chaff — parallel to Mat 3:12)

**Semantic meaning:** asbestos (a + sbennumi = un-quench-able) = a fire that cannot be extinguished before it has completed its intended work. The word describes the fire's inability to be stopped prematurely, not necessarily an eternal ongoing process after its work is completed. Compare: an "unquenchable thirst" can be satisfied; the "unquenchable" describes its character during operation, not eternal duration.

**Note:** In Mrk 9:48, the fire is described as ou sbennytai (V-PPI-3S = is not quenched) — same semantic range as asbestos. The worm ou teleutai (does not die/cease) — same pattern.

---

### G4570 — sbennumi (To Quench/Extinguish)

**Appears in Mrk 9:48:** σβέννυται — V-PPI-3S = Present Passive Indicative, 3rd Singular
Translation: "is not quenched"

**Semantic range:** sbennumi = to extinguish, quench, put out (fire or light). Applied to fire: the fire cannot be put out. Applied to the worm: ou teleutai (it does not die/cease). Both verbs are Present tense — describing their characteristic state.

---

### G4663 — skolex (Worm — Mrk 9:48)

**Greek morphology in Mrk 9:48:** N-NSM = Noun Nominative Singular Masculine
**Lemma:** skolex (G4663) = a worm or intestinal worm; in this context, the worm of decay

**Connection to source text:** The Isa 66:24 Hebrew is tola'at (H8438) — the "worm" that acts on corpses (pigrê). In Isa 66:24, the worm acts on dead bodies. Nave's categorizes Mrk 9:44,46,48 as "of remorse" — suggesting a metaphorical/figurative dimension. The cross-testament parallel tool confirms Isa 66:24 = #1 OT parallel for Mrk 9:48 (score 0.424).

## Hebrew Word Studies

### H8438 — tola'at (Worm — Isa 66:24)

**Strong's data:** 44 total OT occurrences; 14 KJV renderings:
- "and scarlet" (19 = 43.2%)
- "scarlet" (7 = 15.9%)
- "a worm" (3 = 6.8%)
- "the scarlet" (3 = 6.8%)
- "the worms" (2 = 4.5%)
- "worm" (1 = 2.3%), "their worm" (1 = 2.3%)

**Critical observation:** H8438 (tola'at) is the same word used for the scarlet/crimson dye worm — a worm used to produce red dye by crushing. Of its 44 occurrences, 37 (84%) refer to the scarlet/crimson color derived from this worm-type. Only a handful describe the creature itself. In Isa 66:24, the tola'at acts on pigrê (corpses) — it is the worm of decay consuming dead bodies.

**Isa 66:24 Hebrew:** tola'tam lo tamuth = "their worm shall not die." The worm acting on corpses does not die/cease until its work is done.

---

### H784 — esh (Fire — general)

**Strong's data:** 399 total OT occurrences; 56 KJV renderings:
- "with fire" (72 = 18.0%)
- "fire" (64 = 16.0%)
- "the fire" (55 = 13.8%)
- "a fire" (34 = 8.5%)
- "of fire" (33 = 8.3%)

*This is the standard OT word for fire — no ECT-specific content. Relevant for Isa 66:24 and Isa 34:10.*

---

### H6297 — peger (Corpse/Carcase — Isa 66:24)

Already established as E141. The word means corpse/dead body (from pagar = to be exhausted/faint). The objects on which the worm and fire act in Isa 66:24 are dead bodies, not living conscious persons.

---

### H1860 — dir'on (Contempt/Abhorring — Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24)

Already established as E193. Appears only twice in all of Scripture:
1. Dan 12:2 — "some to shame and everlasting contempt" (dir'on olam)
2. Isa 66:24 — "they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh" (dir'on)

**Critical observation:** In Isa 66:24, the dir'on is the attitude held by "all flesh" TOWARD the corpses on display. The word denotes an attitude of loathing/revulsion held by observers toward the condemned. It does not describe a conscious experience OF the condemned persons. This means that if the "contempt" of Dan 12:2 parallels the "abhorring" of Isa 66:24, the contempt is the attitude observers have toward the wicked after their judgment — consistent with the conditionalist reading where the wicked are dead/destroyed and remain objects of loathing.
