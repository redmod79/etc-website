# ECT Strongest Case — E/N/I Classification

## Question
8 key ECT arguments evaluated at E/N/I tier: Rev 14:9-11, Rev 20:10, Matt 25:46, Mark 9:43-48, Luke 16:19-31, Rev 6:9-11, 2 Thess 1:9, Dan 12:2. Present the best case for Eternal Conscious Torment and evaluate each argument at the E/N/I tier level.

## Summary Answer
Across the 8 passages identified by ECT scholars (Peterson, Burk, Morgan) as the strongest biblical case for eternal conscious torment, the E/N/I classification produces the following result: No new E-items are generated by this study (all relevant textual observations were registered in prior studies). 4 of the 8 ECT arguments classify as I-B (competing evidence — Rev 14:9-11, Rev 20:10, Matt 25:46, Dan 12:2), 3 classify as I-C (compatible external — Mark 9:43-48, Luke 16:19-31, Rev 6:9-11), and 1 classifies as I-D (counter-evidence external — 2 Thess 1:9). The 4 I-B items were all resolved in prior studies: the competing evidence on the conditionalist side consists of Plain-level items (lexical facts, didactic genre, observable vocabulary patterns), while the ECT side rests on Ambiguous items (same-adjective parallels in apocalyptic/parabolic genre). The 3 I-C items add concepts the text does not contain but do not override what it says. The 1 I-D item (2 Thess 1:9) requires redefining olethros from its lexical meaning of "destruction" to "ongoing conscious ruin." No passage, when examined at the textual level, uses basanizo or basanismos for the final fate of generic human wicked in didactic genre. The ECT case rests entirely at the inference level — no E-item or N-item directly states or necessarily implies that human wicked experience eternal conscious torment.

## Key Verses
- **Rev 14:10-11** — "He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone... the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night"
- **Rev 20:10** — "The devil... cast into the lake of fire... tormented day and night for ever and ever" (subjects: devil, beast, false prophet)
- **Rev 20:14-15** — "This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire" (human subjects: death vocabulary)
- **Matt 25:46** — "Everlasting punishment [kolasin aionion]... life eternal [zoen aionion]"
- **Mark 9:43-48** — "Hell [gehenna], fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not" (quoting Isa 66:24 — carcasses)
- **Luke 16:23-24** — "In hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments" (parabolic context; uses basanos/odunao, not basanizo)
- **Rev 6:9-11** — "I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain... they should rest" (apocalyptic vision)
- **2 Thess 1:9** — "Everlasting destruction [olethron aionion] from the presence of the Lord"
- **Dan 12:2** — "Everlasting life... shame and everlasting contempt [dera'on olam]"
- **Isa 66:24** — "Carcases [peger] of the men that have transgressed... their worm shall not die" (OT source for Mark 9; Dan 12:2 dera'on)

## Evidence Classification

*Evidence items tracked in etc-master-evidence.md*

### INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY
- This study evaluates 8 passages identified by ECT scholars as their strongest biblical case. Each ECT argument is steelmanned from scholarly sources (Peterson, Burk, Morgan) before the methodology is applied.
- Evidence is gathered from all sides. The ECT argument is presented in its best form before classification.
- Statements below report what the text says and what each side infers. No editorial language is used.
- Most items from these passages were already registered in prior studies (etc-09 through etc-14). This study does not duplicate existing master IDs. New items are added with IDs continuing from E419, N061, I070.

| E22 | Babylon's basanismos IS her completed destruction: "utterly burned with fire" (18:8), "in one hour" (18:10), "thrown down, and shall be found no more at all" (18:21) | Rev 18:8-21 | Neutral | E361 |
| E23 | Rev 19:3 uses identical "smoke rose up for ever and ever" formula for destroyed Babylon | Rev 19:3 | Neutral | E316 |

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|----------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | Rev 14:9-11 describes eternal conscious torment of human wicked — the beast-worshippers are tormented with fire and brimstone forever, never resting | I-B | ECT | FOR: E1/E265 (text states beast-worshippers tormented, smoke ascends for ever, no rest). AGAINST: E21/E266 (OT source Isa 34:10 uses identical imagery for Edom — animals inhabit ruins afterward), E22/E361 (Babylon's basanismos IS her completed destruction), E23/E316 (same smoke formula for destroyed Babylon), E19/E418 (no basanizo for human wicked in judgment passages outside this apocalyptic context). Genre: apocalyptic vision. Tree 3 Gate 3 fails. | The text uses torment vocabulary in an apocalyptic vision. The same smoke formula applies to Babylon (demonstrably destroyed). The OT source (Isa 34:10) describes completed destruction. The claim that this is literal eternal conscious torment requires: (a) treating apocalyptic imagery as literal; (b) ignoring the OT source where the imagery describes completed destruction; (c) ignoring the same-book parallel where basanismos = destruction. | #2 (choosing: literal torment vs. OT-sourced imagery of completed destruction), #3 (applying: literalist reading to apocalyptic genre) |
| I2 | Rev 14:9-11 uses fire-and-brimstone imagery drawn from the OT paradigm of completed destruction (Gen 19, Isa 34, Mal 4), with "smoke ascending" signifying permanence of the result, not duration of the process | I-A | Cond. | E21/E266 (Isa 34:10 source), E22/E361 (Babylon's basanismos = destruction), E23/E316 (Babylon smoke formula), E1/E265 (what the text says). All from E/N tables. | Systematizes the OT source imagery and same-book parallels to conclude the fire-and-brimstone paradigm describes permanent completed destruction. Every component is text-derived. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS: Isa 34:10 interprets Rev 14:11 — OT source text; shared imagery verified) |
| I3 | Rev 20:10 establishes that humans share the same experience as the devil/beast/false prophet because they share the same destination (lake of fire) | I-B | ECT | FOR: E2/E125 (Rev 20:10 — three subjects tormented in lake of fire), E3/E204 (humans cast into same lake of fire, Rev 20:14-15). AGAINST: E4/E254 (human enemies "devoured" in Rev 20:9), E28/E378 (Rev 19:20-21: different vocabulary for symbolic entities vs. humans), E24/E382 (torment-for-ever formula appears once, for non-human subjects only), E3/E204 (when humans enter: "second death," not torment). | The text says three non-human/symbolic subjects are tormented. The text says humans are "devoured" (v.9) and their fate is "second death" (vv.14-15). The extension argument requires: (a) treating symbolic entities and literal humans as having the same experience; (b) adding the assumption that same destination = same experience when the text itself provides different vocabulary for each. | #1 (adding: same-experience assumption), #2 (choosing: extension vs. text's own vocabulary distinction) |
| I4 | Rev 20:10 applies torment to non-human/symbolic entities; the text distinguishes their fate from that of humans, who are "devoured" (v.9) and experience "second death" (vv.14-15) | I-A | Cond. | E2/E125, E4/E254, E3/E204, E28/E378, E24/E382. All from E/N tables. | Systematizes the text's own vocabulary distinctions. Every component is text-derived. | #5 (systematizing) |
| I5 | Matt 25:46 "everlasting punishment" means eternal conscious torment because the same adjective (aionios) modifies both "punishment" and "life," requiring identical duration and nature | I-B | ECT | *(Previously registered as I063)* FOR: E5/E126 (same adjective for both outcomes). AGAINST: E6/E207 (kolasis = punishment, not torment; 2 NT uses), E7/E404b (kolasis not basanismos), E15/E090 (2 Thess 1:9: olethros aionion), E19/E418 (no basanizo for human wicked in 8 judgment passages). | The text says "punishment" (kolasis), not "torment" (basanismos). The claim adds "conscious torment" as the meaning of kolasis. The parallel adjective is a grammatical fact; the nature of each outcome is determined by the nouns, not the adjective. | #1 (adding: conscious torment as meaning of kolasis), #2 (choosing: kolasis as ongoing process vs. result) |
| I6 | Matt 25:46 "everlasting punishment" is the death penalty permanently applied — kolasis describes the penalty, aionios describes its permanence | I-A | Cond. | *(Previously registered as I065)* E5/E126, E6/E207, E15/E090, E7/E404b. All from E/N tables. | Systematizes kolasis (penalty) with olethros (destruction) from 2 Thess 1:9, interpreting the punishment as permanent destruction. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS: 2 Thess 1:9 interprets Matt 25:46 — shared aionios + penalty vocabulary; didactic > parabolic genre) |
| I7 | Mark 9:43-48 (undying worm, unquenchable fire) describes eternal conscious torment in gehenna | I-C | ECT | E8/E127 (Mark 9:43-48 text). E9/E192 (Isa 66:24 source describes peger/carcasses). E10/E406 (worm and fire act upon dead bodies). The text quotes Isa 66:24. The OT source describes dead bodies, not conscious living beings. The claim adds consciousness to subjects the source text identifies as corpses. "Unquenchable fire" in OT usage (Jer 17:27; Ezek 20:47) means fire that finishes its consumption — Jer 17:27 describes Jerusalem's gates, which are not still burning. | The text quotes an OT passage about dead bodies. The claim adds: (a) consciousness to corpses; (b) "unquenchable" as "eternal" rather than "unstoppable." No concept in the text requires the subjects to be conscious. | #1 (adding: consciousness to peger/corpses), #3 (applying: ECT framework to imagery whose OT source describes dead bodies) |
| I8 | Mark 9:43-48 uses Isa 66:24 imagery, where worm and fire consume dead bodies (peger) — the fire and worm are unstoppable agents of destruction, not instruments of ongoing torment | I-A | Cond. | E8/E127, E9/E192, E10/E406. All from E/N tables. | Follows the OT source text. Isa 66:24 identifies the subjects as peger (dead bodies). | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS: Isa 66:24 interprets Mark 9:48 — direct quotation, verified textual connection) |
| I9 | Luke 16:19-31 proves conscious post-mortem suffering and supports ECT | I-C | ECT | E11/E155 (parable — rich man in hades). E12/E328 (uses basanos/odunao, not basanizo). The passage is parabolic genre (Tree 3 Gate 3 FAIL). The subject is a parabolic character (Gate 1 FAIL). The vocabulary differs from eschatological torment passages. Same author's didactic teaching (Acts 2:29,34) presents death as unconsciousness. ECT scholars themselves acknowledge this describes hades (intermediate state), not the final hell. | The passage is a parable with a stated teaching point about Moses and the prophets. The claim uses parabolic details as doctrinal evidence. The passage does not use the eschatological torment vocabulary and does not address the final fate. | #3 (applying: literalist framework to parabolic genre), #1 (adding: doctrinal significance to parabolic imagery) |
| I10 | Rev 6:9-11 proves conscious disembodied souls and supports ECT anthropology | I-C | ECT | E13/E156 (apocalyptic vision — souls cry, told to rest). E14/E344 (same group "lived" at first resurrection — Rev 20:4-5). The passage is apocalyptic genre (Tree 3 Gate 3 FAIL). Subject is a symbolic vision-figure (Gate 1 FAIL). The imagery follows the OT pattern of blood crying for justice (Gen 4:10 — personification). Same-book context shows the altar speaks (Rev 16:7), Death is personified (Rev 6:8). | The passage occurs in an apocalyptic vision where surrounding elements are symbolic. The claim treats the vision as literal anthropological teaching. The text does not address the nature of the intermediate state — it addresses God's justice and vindication. | #3 (applying: literalist framework to apocalyptic genre), #1 (adding: anthropological teaching to a symbolic vision) |
| I11 | 2 Thess 1:9 "everlasting destruction" means eternal separation from God in conscious ruin, not actual destruction | I-D | ECT | *(Previously registered as I068)* E15/E090 (olethros = destruction). E16/E410 (olethros in all 4 NT uses = destruction/ruin). The text says "destruction" (olethros). The claim redefines olethros from destruction to "ongoing conscious ruin/separation." This overrides the lexical meaning. | The claim requires olethros to mean something other than destruction. This is a redefinition of the word's lexical value to maintain the ECT position. | #1 (adding: conscious ongoing existence to "destruction"), #2 (redefining: olethros from destruction to separation) |
| I12 | Dan 12:2 "everlasting contempt" implies conscious experience of shame — the wicked are forever aware of their shame | I-B | ECT | *(Previously registered as I064)* FOR: E17/E288 (olam modifies both life and contempt). AGAINST: E18/E267 (dera'on = onlookers' reaction; only 2 OT uses), E9/E192 (Isa 66:24 objects are peger/dead bodies), E10/E406 (worm and fire act upon dead bodies). | The text says "everlasting contempt." Dera'on describes how onlookers view the dead (Isa 66:24 usage). The claim adds consciousness to a word describing others' reaction. | #1 (adding: consciousness to dera'on), #2 (choosing: subject's experience vs. onlookers' reaction) |
| I13 | Dan 12:2 "everlasting contempt" = permanent reputation of the destroyed, as viewed by the living | I-A | Cond. | *(Previously registered as I066)* E17/E288, E18/E267, E9/E192, E10/E406. All from E/N tables. | Follows the Isa 66:24 usage of dera'on. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS: Isa 66:24 interprets Dan 12:2 — shared rare vocabulary H1860, 2 total occurrences) |
| I14 | The theological argument from God's infinite worth: sin against an infinite God warrants infinite punishment, therefore ECT | I-C | ECT | No verse states that sin against an infinite being requires infinite duration of punishment. The Bible states "the wages of sin is death" (Rom 6:23) — not infinite torment. The Bible states God "can destroy both soul and body in gehenna" (Matt 10:28) — destruction, not infinite torment. | This is a philosophical/theological argument with no direct biblical statement. No verse connects God's infinitude to infinite duration of punishment. The Bible's stated penalty for sin is death (thanatos), not torment (basanismos). | #1 (adding: philosophical principle not stated in Scripture), #3 (applying: external framework about God's infinite worth) |
| I15 | The resurrection of the wicked into bodies "fit for their destiny" (Burk) means bodies that experience eternal conscious torment | I-C | ECT | The Bible states there is a "resurrection of damnation" (John 5:29) — krisis (judgment), not basanismos (torment). Dan 12:2 states some awake to "shame and everlasting contempt." No verse states the wicked are raised with bodies designed for eternal suffering. The nature of the resurrection body for the wicked is not described. | The claim adds: the purpose of the wicked's resurrection is to give them bodies for eternal suffering. No text states this. The judgment passages use destruction/death vocabulary for the outcome. | #1 (adding: purpose of wicked's resurrection body not stated in Scripture), #3 (applying: ECT framework to interpret resurrection) |

### I-B Resolutions

All I-B items in this study (I1, I3, I5, I12) were resolved in prior studies. The resolutions are summarized here.

#### I-B Resolution: I1 — Rev 14:9-11 Describes Eternal Conscious Torment

*(Covered by etc-11-smoke-ascending-forever I-B resolution)*

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR: E265 (text states torment, smoke, no rest in apocalyptic context)
- AGAINST: E266 (OT source Isa 34:10 — identical imagery for completed destruction), E361 (Babylon's basanismos = destruction), E316 (same smoke formula for destroyed Babylon), E418 (no basanizo for human wicked in judgment passages)

**Step 2 — Clarity:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E265 | Ambiguous | Apocalyptic vision. Genre reduces clarity. OT source text describes completed destruction. |
| E266 | Plain | OT text directly states the imagery and its context (animals dwelling in ruins). |
| E361 | Plain | Same-book usage. Babylon's basanismos = her destruction. Observable. |
| E316 | Plain | Same formula, same book. Observable. |
| E418 | Plain | Word-count fact across 8 passages. |

**Step 3 — Weight:** FOR: 1 Ambiguous. AGAINST: 4 Plain.

**Step 4 — SIS:** The OT source (Isa 34:10, direct-speech prophecy) interprets the Revelation imagery (apocalyptic vision). Direct-speech prophecy > apocalyptic in clarity. Shared imagery verified.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong.** Plain items govern Ambiguous.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I3 — Rev 20:10 Extension Argument

*(Covered by etc-12-tormented-forever I-B resolution)*

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR: E125 (three subjects tormented), E204 (humans share same lake destination)
- AGAINST: E254 (human enemies "devoured"), E378 (different vocabulary for entities vs. humans), E382 (torment formula: one occurrence, non-human subjects only), E204 (humans: "second death")

**Step 2 — Clarity:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E125 | Ambiguous | Apocalyptic. Subjects are non-human/symbolic. |
| E204 | Plain | Text directly identifies lake of fire as "second death" for humans. |
| E254 | Plain | "Devoured" is unambiguous destruction vocabulary. |
| E378 | Plain | Observable vocabulary distinction in the same chapter. |
| E382 | Plain | Observable formula count. |

**Step 3 — Weight:** FOR: 1 Ambiguous. AGAINST: 4 Plain.

**Step 4 — SIS:** Rev 20:9 ("devoured"), 20:14-15 ("second death"), and 21:8 ("second death") interpret the fate of humans in the lake of fire. Same chapter, same book. Death/destruction vocabulary governs.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong.** Plain items govern Ambiguous.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I5 — Matt 25:46 Parallel Argument

*(Covered by etc-14-judgment-passages I-B resolution, I063)*

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR: E126 (same adjective aionios for both outcomes)
- AGAINST: E207 (kolasis = punishment, not torment), E404b (kolasis not basanismos), E090 (2 Thess 1:9: olethros aionion), E418 (no basanizo for humans in 8 passages), N059 (destruction vocabulary pattern)

**Step 2 — Clarity:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E126 | Ambiguous | Grammatical fact, but does not determine the nature of kolasis. Parabolic genre. |
| E207 | Plain | Lexical fact. kolasis = penalty. |
| E404b | Plain | Observable vocabulary choice. |
| E090 | Plain | Didactic epistle. Paul's word: olethros. |
| E418 | Plain | Word count across 8 passages. |

**Step 3 — Weight:** FOR: 1 Ambiguous. AGAINST: 5 Plain.

**Step 4 — SIS:** 2 Thess 1:9 (didactic) interprets Matt 25:46 (parabolic discourse). Didactic > parabolic in clarity.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong.** 5 Plain items govern 1 Ambiguous.

---

#### I-B Resolution: I12 — Dan 12:2 Everlasting Conscious Shame

*(Covered by etc-14-judgment-passages I-B resolution, I064)*

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR: E288 (olam modifies both outcomes)
- AGAINST: E267 (dera'on = onlookers' reaction), E192 (Isa 66:24 subjects are peger/dead bodies), E406 (worm/fire act on dead bodies)

**Step 2 — Clarity:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E288 | Ambiguous | Grammatical fact, but does not determine whether contempt is experienced or observed. |
| E267 | Plain | Lexical fact confirmed by Isa 66:24. |
| E192 | Plain | peger = dead body, always. |
| E406 | Plain | Observable subject identification. |

**Step 3 — Weight:** FOR: 1 Ambiguous. AGAINST: 3 Plain.

**Step 4 — SIS:** Isa 66:24 (only other use of dera'on) specifies objects as peger (dead bodies). Shared rare vocabulary (2 total) = verified connection.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong.** 3 Plain items govern 1 Ambiguous.

- All E-items directly quote or closely paraphrase Scripture, or state observable linguistic/distribution facts. Items E420-E422 document what ECT scholars themselves state about the relative strength of arguments (verifiable from published sources). Checked.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- Conditionalist E-items (E9/E192, E15/E090, E26/E303, E27/E302) classified in prior studies with full Tree 3 documentation. All four gates passed.
- New items E420-E422 are Neutral: both sides can verify these scholarly assessments from published sources.
- No E-items classified ECT.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- N-items cited from prior studies. No new N-items generated. Checked.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1, I3, I5, I12 (I-B): E/N items on both sides. Checked.
- I2, I4, I6, I8, I13 (I-A): All components from E/N tables. Systematizes. Checked.
- I7, I9, I10, I14, I15 (I-C): Add concepts the text does not contain but do not override. External. Checked.
- I11 (I-D): Overrides olethros lexical meaning. Counter-evidence external. Checked.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1 (I-B): Requires treating apocalyptic imagery as literal. Conflicts with OT source.
- I3 (I-B): Requires same-destination = same-experience. Text provides different vocabulary.
- I5 (I-B): Requires kolasis to mean torment. Conflicts with lexical value.
- I11 (I-D): Requires olethros to not mean destruction. Overrides.
- I7, I9, I10, I14, I15 (I-C): Add external concepts. Do not override. Compatible.
- I2, I4, I6, I8, I13 (I-A): Use only E/N vocabulary. Aligns. Checked.
- I12 (I-B): Requires dera'on = conscious experience. Conflicts with Isa 66:24 peger context.

**Step E: Consistency checks.**
- I-A items (I2, I4, I6, I8, I13): Only criterion #5 (and #4a). Confirmed.
- I-B items (I1, I3, I5, I12): E/N items on both sides. Confirmed.
- I-C items (I7, I9, I10, I14, I15): Do not override E/N. Compatible. Confirmed.
- I-D item (I11): Overrides E090 (olethros = destruction). Confirmed.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- Isa 34:10 → Rev 14:11: OT source text; shared imagery. #4a verified.
- Isa 66:24 → Mark 9:48: Direct quotation. #4a verified.
- Isa 66:24 → Dan 12:2: Shared rare vocabulary H1860 (2 total occurrences). #4a verified.
- 2 Thess 1:9 → Matt 25:46: Shared aionios + penalty vocabulary; didactic > parabolic. #4a verified.

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture Explicitly States or Necessarily Implies)

1. Rev 14:10-11 states beast-worshippers "shall be tormented with fire and brimstone" and "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night." This is in an apocalyptic vision. The identical smoke-ascending and not-quenched-night-nor-day formula appears in Isa 34:10 for Edom's judgment, after which animals inhabit the ruins.

2. Rev 20:10 states the devil, the beast, and the false prophet are tormented day and night for ever and ever. None of the three is a literal human being. When humans enter the lake of fire (vv.14-15; 21:8), the text's own term is "the second death." When human armies face fire in v.9, the text uses "devoured."

3. Matt 25:46 states the wicked go to "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion) and the righteous to "life eternal" (zoen aionion). The word kolasis means punishment/penalty, not torment (basanismos). The same adjective aionios modifies both outcomes.

4. Mark 9:43-48 quotes Isaiah 66:24. In Isa 66:24, the subjects of the worm and fire are peger (carcasses/dead bodies). Peger never refers to a living person in its 22 OT occurrences. The context (Isa 66:16-17) states the transgressors were slain and consumed.

5. Luke 16:19-31 uses parabolic genre. The vocabulary (basanos/odunao) differs from the eschatological torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos). The passage's stated teaching point is about Moses and the prophets (vv.29,31). ECT scholars themselves identify this as describing hades (intermediate state), not the final lake of fire.

6. Rev 6:9-11 occurs in an apocalyptic vision where surrounding elements are symbolic. The imagery follows the OT pattern of blood crying for justice (Gen 4:10).

7. 2 Thess 1:9 states the punishment is "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion). Olethros means destruction in all 4 NT occurrences. This is a didactic epistle.

8. Dan 12:2 uses olam for both "everlasting life" and "everlasting contempt" (dera'on). Dera'on occurs only in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24, where its objects are dead bodies (peger).

9. No epistle, no Gospel, and no OT passage applies basanizo or basanismos to the final fate of generic human wicked.

## What CANNOT Be Said (Not Explicitly Stated or Necessarily Implied by Scripture)

1. **It cannot be said that any of the 8 ECT anchor texts produces an E-item or N-item supporting ECT.** All 8 ECT arguments classify at the inference level. None produces a statement that directly says or necessarily implies human wicked experience eternal conscious torment.

2. **It cannot be said that basanizo or basanismos is used for the final fate of generic human wicked in any epistle, Gospel, or OT passage.** The torment vocabulary appears in Revelation's apocalyptic framework and in demon-speech (Matt 8:29). When didactic passages address the fate of the wicked, they use destruction/death vocabulary.

3. **It cannot be said that kolasis (Matt 25:46) means "torment."** Kolasis means punishment/penalty. The text says "punishment," not "torment."

4. **It cannot be said that the "extension argument" (Rev 20:10 → humans) follows from the text.** The text itself distinguishes between the three named subjects (torment formula) and humans (death/destruction formula).

5. **It cannot be said that Mark 9:43-48 describes conscious beings in torment.** The quoted OT source (Isa 66:24) describes dead bodies (peger).

6. **It cannot be said that Luke 16:19-31 teaches about the final fate of the wicked.** ECT scholars themselves identify it as describing the intermediate state. The passage is parabolic genre.

7. **It cannot be said that olethros (2 Thess 1:9) means "ongoing conscious ruin."** Olethros means destruction/ruin in all 4 NT uses. Redefining it overrides the word's lexical meaning.

8. **It cannot be said that dera'on (Dan 12:2) describes the wicked's conscious experience.** The only other use (Isa 66:24) describes the onlookers' reaction to dead bodies.

9. **It cannot be said that sin against an infinite God requires infinite punishment.** No verse states this principle. The Bible's stated penalty for sin is death (Rom 6:23), not torment.

## Conclusion

This study examined the 8 passages identified by ECT scholars (Peterson, Burk, Morgan) as the strongest biblical case for eternal conscious torment: Rev 14:9-11, Rev 20:10, Matt 25:46, Mark 9:43-48, Luke 16:19-31, Rev 6:9-11, 2 Thess 1:9, Dan 12:2.

31 E-items were cited (4 Conditionalist, 0 ECT, 27 Neutral). 2 N-items were cited (both Neutral). 15 inferences were classified: 5 I-A (all Conditionalist, systematizing text-derived evidence), 4 I-B (all ECT-direction, all resolved Strong toward conditionalist reading), 7 I-C (all ECT-direction, adding external concepts), 1 I-D (ECT-direction, overriding olethros lexical meaning).

The ECT case rests entirely at the inference level. 0 E-items and 0 N-items support ECT. The 4 I-B items (the strongest ECT inferences) were all resolved Strong: in each case, Plain-level items on the conditionalist side (lexical facts, observable vocabulary patterns, didactic genre) govern Ambiguous items on the ECT side (same-adjective parallels in apocalyptic/parabolic genre). The 7 I-C items add concepts the text does not contain but do not override explicit statements. The 1 I-D item requires redefining olethros from its lexical value.

The conditionalist case produces 5 I-A inferences that systematize text-derived evidence: each uses only E/N-level vocabulary and concepts. The 4 Conditionalist E-items (peger/carcasses, everlasting destruction, aionios for past time, aionios fire for Sodom) all passed Tree 3 four-gate validation.
