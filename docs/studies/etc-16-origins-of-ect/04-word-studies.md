## Key Terms for the Immortality Question

### athanasia (G110) -- "immortality" (deathlessness)
**Original:** athanasia
**Transliteration:** athanasia
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From a-thanatos (un-death); deathlessness, immortality
**Occurrences:** 3 total in NT

**Translations:**
- "immortality" -- 3x (1 Cor 15:53, 54; 1 Tim 6:16)

**Key verses:**
- 1 Tim 6:16: God "only hath immortality (athanasia)"
- 1 Cor 15:53: "this mortal must put on immortality (athanasia)"
- 1 Cor 15:54: "this mortal shall have put on immortality (athanasia)"

**Historical significance:** This word appears ONLY 3 times in the NT. It is attributed exclusively to God (1 Tim 6:16) and to resurrected believers (1 Cor 15:53-54). It is never attributed to the human soul. The Greek philosophical concept of an inherently immortal soul uses different terminology (athanatos psyche), but the NT does not apply athanasia to the psyche.

### aphtharsia (G861) -- "incorruptibility"
**Original:** aphtharsia
**Transliteration:** aphtharsia
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From aphthartos (incorruptible); incorruptibility, unending existence
**Occurrences:** 8 total in NT

**Translations:**
- "incorruption" -- 4x
- "immortality" -- 2x
- "sincerity" -- 2x

**Key verses:**
- Rom 2:7: "seek for glory and honour and immortality (aphtharsia)"
- 1 Cor 15:42: "sown in corruption; raised in incorruption (aphtharsia)"
- 2 Tim 1:10: Christ "brought life and immortality (aphtharsia) to light through the gospel"
- Eph 6:24: "all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity (aphtharsia)"

**Historical significance:** Like athanasia, aphtharsia is something to be sought (Rom 2:7), received at resurrection (1 Cor 15:42), and revealed through the gospel (2 Tim 1:10). It is never described as an inherent human property.

### psyche (G5590) -- "soul"
**Original:** psyche
**Transliteration:** psyche
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**Definition:** From psycho (to breathe); breath, spirit, the soul; by implication life itself
**Occurrences:** 105 total in NT

**Translations:**
- "soul" (major usage)
- "life" (common usage)
- "mind" (occasional)
- "heart" (occasional)

**Historical significance:** The Greek word psyche was used by Plato for the immortal soul. The same word appears in the NT but with a Hebrew semantic background (nephesh). In Platonic usage, psyche is the divine, pre-existent, immortal essence imprisoned in the body. In biblical usage, psyche/nephesh means the whole living person (Gen 2:7 -- man BECAME a living psyche), or life itself (Matt 16:25 -- "lose his psyche"), or appetite/desire. The NT never calls the psyche "immortal" (athanatos). Instead, Jesus says God can DESTROY the psyche (Matt 10:28).

The conflation of Platonic psyche (inherently immortal) with biblical psyche (mortal, whole person) is the central linguistic channel through which Greek philosophy entered Christian theology.

### thnetos (G2349) -- "mortal"
**Original:** thnetos
**Transliteration:** thnetos
**Part of Speech:** adjective
**Definition:** From thnesko (to die); liable to die, mortal
**Occurrences:** 6 total in NT

**Translations:**
- "mortal" -- 5x
- "mortality" -- 1x

**Key verses:**
- Rom 6:12: "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal (thnetos) body"
- Rom 8:11: "shall also quicken your mortal (thnetos) bodies"
- 1 Cor 15:53: "this mortal (thnetos) must put on immortality"
- 2 Cor 4:11: "the life of Jesus manifest in our mortal (thnetos) flesh"
- 2 Cor 5:4: "that mortality (thnetos) might be swallowed up of life"

**Historical significance:** The NT explicitly calls the human condition "mortal" (thnetos). This directly contradicts the Platonic claim that the human soul is inherently immortal (athanatos). The mortal must "put on" immortality -- it is not already possessed.

## Summary of Word Study Findings

The biblical vocabulary consistently treats immortality as:
1. **Belonging to God alone** (athanasia -- 1 Tim 6:16)
2. **Something to be sought** (aphtharsia -- Rom 2:7)
3. **Put on at resurrection** (athanasia -- 1 Cor 15:53-54)
4. **Brought to light through the gospel** (aphtharsia -- 2 Tim 1:10)
5. **NOT an inherent human property** (thnetos -- humans are mortal)
6. **The soul (psyche) can be destroyed** (Matt 10:28)

The Platonic concept of an inherently immortal soul (athanatos psyche) has no lexical support in the NT. The NT never combines athanasia/athanatos with psyche.
