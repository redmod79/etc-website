## Kolasis — G2851

**Original:** κόλασις (kolasis)
**Transliteration:** kólasis
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 2 NT occurrences

**Definition:**
Penal infliction; from kolazo (to prune/curtail/restrain). Definition: "penal infliction:—punishment, torment."

**Etymology:** From kolazo (G2849) = to prune/curtail. The root meaning carries the sense of
restrictive pruning — cutting back, constraining, curtailing. This is the word used for punishment
in the sense of judicial penalty/correction, not ongoing torture.

**Translations in KJV:**
- "punishment" — 1 occurrence (Mat 25:46)
- Total KJV occurrences in database: 1 (the other NT occurrence at 1 Jn 4:18 is not in the lookup)

**All NT occurrences:**
1. Matthew 25:46 — "and these shall go away into everlasting punishment [kolasin aionion]"
2. 1 John 4:18 — "fear hath torment [kolasis]" (same word used for the fear of judgment)

**Key observational notes:**
- Kolasis (G2851) is NOT basanismos (G929/torment) — these are distinct Greek words
- The punishment noun in Matt 25:46 specifies punitive/judicial infliction, not ongoing torture
- Paul's eschatological noun (2Th 1:9) is olethros (destruction), not kolasis
- The lexical entry itself notes "punishment, torment" as translations, but the
  etymology (kolazo = prune/curtail) emphasizes restraint/removal, not ongoing conscious suffering
- Appears in only 2 NT passages — extremely limited scope

**OT contexts:** The BLB outline includes Ezekiel 14:3 among references — this places the word
in the judgment/penalty category consistent with judicial punishment.

## Basanismos — G929

**Original:** βασανισμός (basanismos)
**Transliteration:** basanismós
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 6 NT occurrences

**Definition:**
Torture; torment. From basanizo (G928). Definition: "torture:—torment."

**Root:** bασανος (basanos) = a touchstone (for testing gold quality); extended to mean the
testing of prisoners by torture. The word group carries the meaning of testing under severe pain.

**Translations in KJV:**
- "torment" — 5 occurrences (83.3%)
- "the torment" — 1 occurrence (16.7%)

**All NT occurrences (ALL in Revelation):**
1. Revelation 9:5 — "that they should be tormented five months: and their torment [basanismos] was as the torment of a scorpion"
2. Revelation 14:11 — "the smoke of their torment [basanismos] ascendeth up for ever and ever"
3. Revelation 18:7 — "so much torment [basanismos] and sorrow give her"
4. Revelation 18:10 — "Alas, alas that great city Babylon... for in one hour is thy judgment come"
5. Revelation 18:15 — "the merchants... shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment [basanismos]"

**Critical observation:** ALL 6 occurrences of basanismos (the torment noun) are in Revelation.
The word does NOT appear in:
- Any Pauline epistles
- Hebrews
- The Synoptic Gospels
- Acts
- Any general epistles

This lexical distribution means that torment vocabulary in eschatological contexts is confined to
the Revelation text and is NOT present in the didactic epistles that systematically teach about
the fate of the wicked.

## Basanizo — G928

**Original:** βασανίζω (basanizo)
**Transliteration:** basanízō
**Part of Speech:** verb
**BLB Count:** 12 NT occurrences

**Definition:**
To torture; to torment. Definition: "to torture:—pain, toil, torment, toss, vex."

**Translations in KJV (12 occurrences, 11 unique renderings):**
- "tormented" — 2
- "to torment" — 1
- "tossed" — 1 (storm at sea: Matt 14:24)
- "that thou torment" — 1 (demon speaking)
- "toiling" — 1 (rowing in wind: Mark 6:48)
- "torment" — 1
- "vexed" — 1 (Lot vexed by wicked: 2 Pet 2:8)
- "they should be tormented" — 1
- "pained" — 1 (woman in childbirth: Rev 12:2)
- "he shall be tormented" — 1
- "shall be tormented" — 1

**All NT occurrences:**
- Matthew 8:6 — centurion's servant "grievously tormented" (sick, not eschatological)
- Matthew 8:29 — demon says "Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?"
- Matthew 14:24 — ship "tossed" with waves (literal storm)
- Mark 5:7 — demon says "I adjure thee... torment me not"
- Mark 6:48 — disciples "toiling" in rowing (literal physical strain)
- Luke 8:28 — demon "I beseech thee, torment me not"
- 2 Peter 2:8 — Lot "vexed his righteous soul" (moral distress)
- Revelation 9:5 — locusts torment men five months (tribulation judgment)
- Revelation 11:10 — two prophets "tormented them that dwelt on the earth"
- Revelation 12:2 — woman "pained to be delivered" (birth pangs)
- Revelation 14:10 — beast-worshippers "shall be tormented with fire and brimstone"
- Revelation 20:10 — devil/beast/false prophet "shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever"

**Critical observation:** The eschatological occurrences of basanizo are confined to Revelation (vv. 9:5; 11:10; 14:10; 20:10). Non-eschatological uses include: physical pain (Matt 8:6; Rev 12:2), storm/toiling (Matt 14:24; Mark 6:48), demonic speech (Matt 8:29; Mark 5:7; Luke 8:28), and moral distress (2 Pet 2:8).

## Tartaroo — G5020

**Original:** ταρταρόω (tartaroo)
**Transliteration:** tartaróō
**Part of Speech:** verb (hapax legomenon — single occurrence)
**BLB Count:** 1 NT occurrence

**Definition:**
From Τάρταρος (Tartaros, the deepest abyss of Hades in Greek mythology); to incarcerate
in eternal [darkness/Tartaros]. Definition: "to incarcerate in eternal [abyss]."

**Translations in KJV:**
- "down to hell" — 1 (100%)

**All NT occurrences:**
1. 2 Peter 2:4 — "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell [tartaroo], and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment"

**Critical observations:**

1. **Greek mythological term:** Tartaros was the Greek mythological name for the lowest part of
   the underworld where the Titans were imprisoned. Peter uses this term (likely familiar to
   Greco-Roman readers) for the pre-judgment confinement of fallen angels.

2. **Verb, not noun:** The Greek is a verb (tartaroo = "to Tartarize / cast into Tartaros"),
   not a noun describing a place. This is a denominal verb.

3. **Applied exclusively to fallen angels:** Never applied to human beings in any NT text.

4. **Pre-judgment state:** The angels are "reserved unto judgment" — this is temporary, pre-judgment
   confinement, not a final punishment.

5. **Characterization:** "Chains of darkness" — NOT fire, NOT torment vocabulary.

6. **Relationship to Greek mythology:** The use of the word tartaroo by Peter represents his
   adoption of a culturally familiar term for a dark confinement, not an endorsement of the full
   Greek mythological Tartaros cosmology. This is an important data point for Study 16: the NT
   writers were aware of Greek underworld vocabulary and could use it when it was recognizable
   to their audience, while restricting its application (only to angels, not humans; only to
   pre-judgment confinement, not final punishment).

## Aionios — G166

**Original:** αἰώνιος (aionios)
**Transliteration:** aiṓnios
**Part of Speech:** adjective
**BLB Count:** 71 NT occurrences

**Definition:**
Perpetual (also used of past time, or past and future as well). From aion (G165, "an age") + -ios
(denominal adjectival suffix = "pertaining to"). Definition: "perpetual (also used of past time,
or past and future as well)."

**Translations in KJV (48 KJV occurrences, 12 unique renderings):**
- "eternal" — 19 (39.6%)
- "everlasting" — 13 (27.1%)
- "of eternal" — 7 (14.6%)
- "since the world began" — 1 (Rom 16:25)
- "for ever" — 1 (Phm 1:15)
- [plus other variants]

**Key NT eschatological negative uses:**
- Matthew 25:41 — "everlasting fire" (pyr aionion)
- Matthew 25:46 — "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion) / "life eternal" (zoen aionion)
- Mark 3:29 — "eternal sin/damnation" (aioniou hamartematos in N1904)
- 2 Thessalonians 1:9 — "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion)
- Hebrews 6:2 — "eternal judgment" (krimatos aioniou)
- Revelation 14:6 — "everlasting gospel" (euangelion aionion)

**Demonstrated bidirectionality (past-time uses):**
- Romans 16:25 — "since the world began" (chronois aioniois = past ages)
- 2 Timothy 1:9 — "before the world began" (pro chronon aionion = before the age-times)
- Titus 1:2 — same word looks backward (pro chronon aionion) and forward (zoes aionion) in one verse

**Subject-dependent duration (non-eschatological uses):**
- Philemon 1:15 — modifies mortal human (Onesimus) — bounded by lifespan
- Hebrews 9:12 — "eternal redemption" obtained ephapax (once for all, Aorist) — completed act, permanent result

**Contrast with aidios (G126):**
- G126 (aidios) = from aei ("always/continually") — the Greek word for inherent, unbroken endlessness
- G166 (aionios) = from aion ("age") — pertaining to the age; NOT the "inherent endlessness" word
- Paul used aidios for God's power (Rom 1:20) and aionios for eternal life (in the same epistle)
- Jude used aidios for fallen angels' ongoing chains (Jude 1:6) and aionios for Sodom's completed fire (1:7)

**Sodom definition test (N029):**
Jude 1:7 = "eternal fire" (puros aioniou); 2 Pet 2:6 = same event = "turned to ashes"
→ "Eternal fire" = permanent destructive result, not ongoing burning process

---

## Olethros — G3639

**Original:** ὄλεθρος (olethros)
**Transliteration:** ólethros
**Part of Speech:** masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 4 NT occurrences

**Definition:**
Ruin; destruction. Definition: "ruin, i.e. death, punishment:—destruction."
From a primary verb óllymi (to destroy), a prolonged form of apollumi.

**Translations in KJV (4 occurrences):**
- "destruction" — 3 (75.0%)
- "the destruction" — 1 (25.0%)

**All NT occurrences:**
1. 1 Thessalonians 5:3 — "then sudden destruction [olethros] cometh upon them"
2. 2 Thessalonians 1:9 — "who shall be punished with everlasting destruction [olethron aionion]"
3. 1 Corinthians 5:5 — "deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction [olethron] of the flesh"
4. 1 Timothy 6:9 — "which drown men in destruction [olethron] and perdition [apoleian]"

**Critical observation:** Paul consistently uses olethros for destruction outcomes. His chosen
eschatological noun for the fate of the wicked (2Th 1:9) is olethros — NOT basanismos.
In 1 Tim 6:9, olethros appears alongside apōleia (G684 = destruction/ruin), reinforcing the
destruction semantic cluster. Paul never uses basanismos in any context, eschatological or otherwise.

## Sheol — H7585

**Original:** שְׁאוֹל (sheol)
**Transliteration:** shᵉʼôwl
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 65 occurrences

**Definition:**
Hades or the world of the dead (as if a subterranean retreat), including its accessories and
inmates. Definition: "grave, hell, pit."

**Translations in KJV (67 occurrences, 25 unique renderings):**
- "to the grave" — 10 (14.9%)
- "hell" — 7 (10.4%)
- "of hell" — 6 (9.0%)
- "in the grave" — 6 (9.0%)
- "the grave" — 4 (6.0%)
- "Hell" — 4 (6.0%)
- "into hell" — 4 (6.0%)
- "of the grave" — 4 (6.0%)
- "to hell" — 3 (4.5%)
- [plus 16 additional single/double occurrences]

**Translation distribution note:** The KJV renders the SAME Hebrew word H7585 as both "grave"
and "hell" depending on context — approximately equal distribution. This confirms that sheol
does not inherently mean "a place of eternal torment"; the KJV translators themselves rendered
it as "grave" in narrative and wisdom contexts.

**Key distribution observations:**
- Righteous people go to sheol: Gen 37:35 (Jacob); Ps 16:10 (David); Job 14:13 (Job)
- Wicked people also go to sheol: Ps 9:17; Prov 5:5; 7:27; 9:18
- The character of sheol: silence, rest, darkness — Job 3:17-19 (E140)
- LXX translates H7585 as G86 (hades) 58/67 times (PMI 33.87) — the dominant correspondence

**Semantic range:** The word's definition includes "as if a subterranean retreat" — consistent
with the OT imagery of the dead going "down" to a realm below. Nothing in the lexical definition
or OT usage requires ongoing conscious torment.

## Hades — G86

**Original:** ᾅδης (hades)
**Transliteration:** háidēs
**Part of Speech:** proper locative noun
**BLB Count:** 11 NT occurrences

**Definition:**
Unseen. From alpha-privative (negative) + idein (to see). Properly, "unseen." Definition: "Hades, the realm of the dead (the unseen world)."

**Translations in KJV (11 occurrences, 4 unique renderings):**
- "hell" — 7 (63.6%)
- "of hell" — 2 (18.2%)
- "O grave" — 1 (9.1%; 1 Cor 15:55)
- "Hell" — 1 (9.1%)

**All NT occurrences:**
- Matthew 11:23 — Capernaum brought "down to hell [hades]"
- Matthew 16:18 — "gates of hell [hades] shall not prevail" against the church
- Luke 10:15 — Capernaum brought "down to hell [hades]"
- Luke 16:23 — rich man in hades, in torments
- Acts 2:27 — "thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [hades]" (Ps 16:10 quoted)
- Acts 2:31 — Christ's soul was not left in hell [hades]
- 1 Corinthians 15:55 — "O grave [hades], where is thy victory?" (Hos 13:14 quoted)
- Revelation 1:18 — "I have the keys of hell [hades] and of death"
- Revelation 6:8 — Death and Hell (hades) follow the pale horse
- Revelation 20:13 — "hell [hades] delivered up the dead which were in them"
- Revelation 20:14 — "death and hell [hades] were cast into the lake of fire"

**Key structural observations:**
- Rev 20:13: hades delivers up the dead for judgment
- Rev 20:14: hades is cast into the lake of fire — it ENDS; hades is not the final state
- The LXX translates H7585 (sheol) as G86 (hades) 58/67 times (PMI 33.87 — dominant)
- NT writers confirm the equation: Acts 2:27/31 quotes Ps 16:10 (sheol → hades); 1 Cor 15:55 quotes Hos 13:14 (sheol → hades)

## Gehenna — G1067

**Original:** γέεννα (gehenna)
**Transliteration:** géenna
**Part of Speech:** feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 12 NT occurrences

**Definition:**
From Hebrew Gê Hinnōm (Valley of Hinnom). Valley of (the son of) Hinnom; Ge-Hinnom, a valley
of Jerusalem, used figuratively as a name for the place (or state) of everlasting punishment.
Definition: "hell" (the place of final judgment/destruction).

**Translations in KJV (11 KJV occurrences, 2 unique renderings):**
- "hell" — 9 (81.8%)
- "of hell" — 2 (18.2%)

**All NT occurrences (all 12 = eschatological judgment):**
- Matthew 5:22 — angry with brother "in danger of hell fire [gehenna]"
- Matthew 5:29 — better that one member perish than whole body "cast into hell [gehenna]"
- Matthew 5:30 — better one member cut off than body "cast into hell [gehenna]"
- Matthew 10:28 — fear him who can destroy soul and body in hell [gehenna] — apollumi verb
- Matthew 18:9 — better to enter life than "cast into hell fire [gehenna]"
- Matthew 23:15 — Pharisee proselytes become "more the child of hell [gehenna]"
- Matthew 23:33 — "how can ye escape the damnation of hell [gehenna]?"
- Mark 9:43 — better to enter life maimed than go into "hell [gehenna], into the fire that never shall be quenched"

- Luke 12:5 — fear him who can cast into hell [gehenna]
- James 3:6 — the tongue is set on fire of hell [gehenna]

**Critical vocabulary observations:**
- The key verb describing what happens in gehenna (Matt 10:28) = apollumi (G622 = destroy fully)
- Torment vocabulary (basanismos/basanizo) is ABSENT from ALL 12 gehenna passages
- The imagery derives from the Valley of Hinnom (historical burning dump outside Jerusalem)
- The source text (Isa 66:24) quoted in Mark 9:44,46,48 depicts fire/worm acting on pigrê (corpses)
- No gehenna passage contains "for ever and ever" language

**Historical note on the Valley of Hinnom:**
The BDB entry for Gê Hinnōm = "valley of the son(s) of Hinnom." The valley lay south/southwest of
Jerusalem. In OT times it was associated with Molech worship and child sacrifice (2 Kgs 23:10; Jer 7:31).
By the first century, the word gehenna was already used in Jewish literature as a metaphor for the
place of final eschatological judgment. Jesus' use builds on this existing Jewish vocabulary.

## Apollumi — G622

**Original:** ἀπόλλυμι (apollumi)
**Transliteration:** apóllymi
**Part of Speech:** verb
**BLB Count:** 92 NT occurrences

**Definition:**

**Key eschatological uses:**
- Matthew 10:28 — God can "destroy [apollumi] both soul and body in hell [gehenna]"
- John 3:16 — "should not perish [apollumi], but have everlasting life" — opposite of eternal life
- Romans 2:12 — "as many as have sinned without law shall also perish [apollōntai] without law"
- 1 Corinthians 1:18 — "the preaching of the cross is to them that perish [apollumenois] foolishness"
- 1 Corinthians 15:18 — "they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished [apollōlanto]"
- 2 Thessalonians 2:10 — those who "received not the love of truth" are "apollumenois" (perishing)

**Critical observation:** G622 (apollumi = to destroy fully) has 92 BLB occurrences compared to
G928 (basanizo = to torment) with 12. The destruction vocabulary is 7+ times more frequent.
In eschatological contexts outside Revelation, the dominant vocabulary is destruction/perishing
(apollumi), not torment (basanizo).
