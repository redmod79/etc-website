## Question

When did the doctrine of Eternal Conscious Torment (ECT) originate? What were the historical,
philosophical, and theological channels through which it entered Christian theology? What did
early church writers say about the final fate of the wicked, and how did views develop over time?
How does understanding the origins of ECT affect its biblical evaluation?

### HELL (Nave's main entry)

*(This is the primary Nave's entry for the cluster of concepts most relevant to ECT)*

- In the A.V., this word occurs in the O.T. Scriptures as the translation of the Hebrew
  word "sheol," which signifies the unseen state.
- In the R.V. of O.T., "hell" appears only in: ISA 5:14; 14:9,15; 28:15,18; 57:9;
  EZK 31:16,17; 32:21,27; AMO 9:2; JON 2:2; HAB 2:5
- In the R.V., "sheol" is translated "lowest pit" at DEU 32:22; PSA 86:13
- And is translated "pit" at PSA 55:15
- In the R.V. "Sheol" itself occurs in: 2SA 22:6; JOB 11:8; 26:6; PSA 9:17; 16:10;
  18:5; 116:3; 139:8; PRO 5:5; 7:27; 9:18; 15:11,24; 23:14; 27:20
- Sheol is translated "grave" in A.V. in: GEN 37:35; 42:38; 44:29,31; 1SA 2:6; 1KI 2:6,9;
  JOB 7:9; 14:13; 17:13; 21:13; 24:19; PSA 6:5; 30:3; 31:17; 49:14,15; 88:3; 89:48;
  141:7; PRO 1:12; 30:16; ECC 9:10; SOS 8:6; HOS 13:14
- In the R.V. the Greek word "gehenna" is translated "hell" in: MAT 5:22,29,30; 10:28;
  18:9; 23:15,33; MRK 9:43,45,47; LUK 12:5; JAS 3:6
- The R.V. has introduced "Hades" (the word found in the Greek text, signifying the unseen
  world) in: MAT 11:23; 16:18; LUK 10:15; 16:23; ACT 2:27,31; REV 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14

**THE FUTURE HOME OF THE WICKED** (Nave's designation):
PSA 9:17; PRO 5:5; 9:13,15-18; 15:24; 23:13,14; ISA 30:33; 33:14; MAT 3:12; 5:29,30;
7:13,14; 8:11,12; 10:28; 13:30,38-42,49,50; 16:18; 18:8,9,34,35; 22:13; 25:28-30,41,46;
MRK 9:43-48; LUK 3:17; 16:23-26,28; ACT 1:25; 2TH 1:9; 2PE 2:4; JUD 1:6-23;
REV 2:11; 9:1,2; 11:7; 14:10,11; 19:20; 20:10,15; 21:8

*See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF*

**Note:** Nave's uses a single entry "HELL" to collapse sheol, hades, and gehenna into one
unified category. The GEHENNA and SHEOL entries both redirect to HELL. This confirms the
established evidence (IA016 from etc5-05) that the topical Bible tradition itself reflects
the four-word translation collapse.

---

### TORMENTS

- Of the wicked: LUK 16:23-28; REV 14:10,11
- *See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF*

**Note:** Only two passage clusters cited under "TORMENTS": (1) Luke 16 parabolic account,
(2) Revelation 14:10-11. The brevity of this entry confirms that torment vocabulary is
confined to specific passages.

---

### FIRE — Relevant Sub-entries

**Figurative uses of FIRE:**
- Judgments: DEU 4:24; 32:22; ISA 33:14; JER 23:29; AMO 1:4,7,10,12,14; 2:2; MAL 3:2;
  LUK 12:49; REV 20:9
- Of the destruction of the wicked: MAT 13:42,50; 25:41; MRK 9:44; REV 9:2; 21:8

**EVERLASTING FIRE sub-entry:**
ISA 33:14; MAT 18:8; 25:41; MRK 9:44

**Note:** Nave's categories fire as "figurative" in eschatological judgment contexts and
places it in the sub-entry "destruction of the wicked" — not a "torment of the wicked"
sub-entry. The language is destruction-oriented at the topic level.

---

### PUNISHMENT — ETERNAL Sub-entry

From the PUNISHMENT main entry:

**ETERNAL** sub-entry:
ISA 34:8-10; DAN 12:2; MAT 3:12; 10:28; 18:8; 25:41,46; MRK 3:29; LUK 3:17; JHN 5:29;
HEB 6:2; 10:28-31; REV 14:10,11; 19:3; 20:10

*See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF*

**Note:** This is the full Nave's "eternal punishment" reference list. It draws from multiple
genres and contexts, combining passages that use different vocabulary (destruction, punishment,
torment). The list includes passages where the key word is apollumi (Matt 10:28) alongside
passages with basanismos (Rev 14:10,11).

---

### WICKED (PEOPLE) — Punishment Sub-entry (extensive)

Key comparisons used by Nave's for the wicked's fate:
- Ashes under the feet: MAL 4:3
- Chaff: JOB 21:18; PSA 1:4; MAT 3:12
- Stubble: JOB 21:18; MAL 4:1

The PUNISHMENT OF sub-entry includes an extensive verse list:
GEN 2:17; 3:16-19; 4:7; [many OT references]... MAT 3:7,10,12; 5:19-30; 7:13,19,23,26,27;
8:12; 10:28,33; 11:23; 12:34; 13:12-15,30,38-42,49,50; 15:13; 16:26; 18:7-9,34,35; 21:19,41,44;
22:13; 23:14,33; 24:50,51; 25:30,32,33,41,46; 26:24; MRK 4:12,25; 8:36,38; 9:43; [...]
REV 2:22,23; 3:3; 6:15-17; 9:4-6,15,18; 11:18; 14:9-11; 16:2-21; 18:5; 19:15,17-21;
20:10,15; 21:8,27; 22:19

*See JUDGMENTS; See HELL; See PUNISHMENT*

### GEHENNA (entry)

```
See HELL
```

*(Redirect only — confirms that Nave's treats gehenna as a subset of the unified "hell" concept)*

---

### SHEOL (entry)

```
See HELL (Hades)
```

*(Redirect only — Nave's explicitly equates sheol with hades in this redirect)*

---

### HADES (from the search results)

Nave's two-part hades entry:
1. The unseen world, translated "hell" in A.V., but in R.V. the word "Hades" is retained:
   MAT 10:28; 11:23; 16:18; LUK 10:15; 16:23; ACT 2:27,31; REV 1:18; 6:8; 20:13,14
   *See HELL*
2. The realm (state) of the dead: 2SA 22:6; JOB 26:5; PSA 6:5; 17:15; 30:9; 49:15; 86:13;
   88:10-12; 115:17; 116:3; PRO 15:24; 21:16; 27:20; ECC 9:4-6; ISA 5:14; JON 2:2;
   LUK 23:42,43; JHN 8:22; 2CO 12:4
   *See HELL; See IMMORTALITY; See PARADISE; See RIGHTEOUS, FUTURE STATE OF*

### SECOND DEATH (from search results)

"General scriptures concerning REV 20:14"
*See WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF*

## Vocabulary Summary from Nave's

Nave's topical organization reveals a significant structural observation: the core biblical
vocabulary for the fate of the wicked clusters around **destruction imagery** in the topical
entries (chaff, stubble, ashes, carcasses) while **torment imagery** (torments) receives
only two passage citations (Luke 16; Rev 14:10,11). This distribution in a topical
dictionary reflects the dominance of destruction vocabulary across the biblical canon.

The "FIRE — EVERLASTING FIRE" sub-entry (ISA 33:14; MAT 18:8; 25:41; MRK 9:44) confirms
the study's established data: "everlasting fire" is applied to the wicked's fate, but the
source definition of "eternal fire" is established by Sodom's example (Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6).

## Related Topics Discovered

1. **SECOND DEATH** — redirects to WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF; Rev 20:14 is the primary verse
2. **LOST, THE** — redirects to WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF
3. **DAMNED** — redirects to WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF
4. **WRATH** — redirects to See PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL (among others)
5. **ETERNITY** — references unclassified scriptures; See PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL

The multiple redirects to "WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF" without a separate "WICKED, TORMENT OF"
entry confirms the predominant framing in the biblical topical tradition.
