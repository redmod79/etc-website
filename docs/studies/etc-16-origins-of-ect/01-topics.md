## Question
Historical investigation: What are the historical channels through which the doctrine of eternal conscious torment (ECT) entered Christian theology? Trace the Platonic influence, intertestamental literature, early church writers, and the progression from conditional immortality to innate immortality as church doctrine.

## Topics

### IMMORTALITY (Nave's)
General scriptures concerning: GEN 5:24; 2SA 12:23; 2KI 2:11; NEH 9:5; JOB 4:17-21; 14:13; PSA 16:10,11; 21:4; 22:26; 23:6; 31:5; 36:9; 37:18,27; 49:7-9,14,15; 73:26; 86:12; 102:4,25-28; 121:8; 133:3; 145:1,2; PRO 14:32; ECC 3:21; 12:7; ISA 14:9; 25:8; 26:19; 38:18,19; EZK 32:31; DAN 12:2,3; MAT 10:28; 16:26; 19:16,17; 25:46; MRK 10:30; 12:26,27; LUK 9:25; 10:25-28; 20:36-38; JHN 3:14-16,36; 5:39,40; 6:39,40,44,47,50,51,53,54,58; 10:28; 11:25,26; 14:19; 17:2,3; ACT 20:32; 23:8,9; 26:7,8,18; ROM 2:7; 6:22,23; 1CO 15:12-55; GAL 6:8; COL 1:5,6; 1TH 4:13-18; 5:10; 2TH 1:7-9; 2:16; 1TI 4:8; 6:12,19; 2TI 1:9,10; TIT 1:2; 3:7; HEB 9:15; 10:34; 11:5,10,13-16; 1PE 1:3-5; 1JN 2:17,25; 5:13; JDE 1:21; REV 1:7; 3:4; 22:5

Cross-references: RESURRECTION, RIGHTEOUS PROMISES TO, WICKED PUNISHMENT OF

**Key observation for this study:** Nave's IMMORTALITY entry contains both resurrection passages and immortality-of-the-soul passages, but Bible itself consistently ties immortality to resurrection rather than inherent soul quality.

### PHILOSOPHY (Nave's)
- The nature of things: ECC 1-7
- A philosophical discussion about wisdom: JOB 28
- Philosophical inductions about God's providence: JOB 5:8-20; 9; 10:2-21; 12:6-24; 33:12-30; 37
- Reveals mysteries of providence: PRO 25:2; ROM 1:19,20
- Is not sufficient for adequate knowledge of God: 1CO 1:21,22
- Not enough for salvation through the atonement: 1CO 2:6-10
- Not Paul's method of preaching: 1CO 1:17,19,21; 2:1-5,13
- Greek schools of: ACT 17:18
- Rabbinical: COL 2:8,16-19; 1TI 6:20

**Key observation for this study:** The Bible itself warns against philosophy (Col 2:8) and records Paul's encounter with Greek philosophers (Acts 17:18). The phrase "oppositions of science falsely so called" (1 Tim 6:20) uses the Greek "gnosis" -- Gnosticism was heavily influenced by Platonism.

### SOUL (Nave's)
Cross-references only: See SPIRIT, IMMORTALITY, MAN A SPIRIT, RIGHTEOUS FUTURE STATE OF, WICKED PUNISHMENT OF

**Key observation:** Nave's does not have a standalone entry for SOUL -- it redirects. This is telling: the concept is not a standalone biblical category the way systematic theology treats it.

### ETERNAL PUNISHMENT / PUNISHMENT ETERNAL (Nave's)
See PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL -- redirects to punishment entries.

### TORMENTS (Nave's)
Of the wicked: LUK 16:23-28; REV 14:10,11
Cross-references: WICKED, PUNISHMENT OF

**Key observation:** Only two passages are listed under TORMENTS -- one parabolic (Luke 16) and one apocalyptic (Rev 14). Neither is didactic prose.
