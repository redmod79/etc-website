## etc5-05 — Four "Hell" Words (Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, Tartaroo)

**Key findings relevant to Study 16:**

1. **The Translation Collapse:** The KJV translates four distinct terms as "hell":
   - H7585 (sheol): ~62 of 67 occurrences as "hell," "grave," or "pit"
   - G86 (hades): 11 occurrences as "hell" (×10) or "grave" (×1)
   - G1067 (gehenna): 12 occurrences all as "hell"
   - G5020 (tartaroo): 1 occurrence as "hell"
   This translation collapse produces a unified English concept where the original texts
   use four distinct terms with different scopes.

2. **Sheol and hades are the same concept** (LXX translates sheol as hades 58/67 times,
   PMI 33.87 — E138). Neither sheol nor hades inherently means ongoing conscious torment.

3. **Both righteous and wicked go to sheol** (Gen 37:35; Ps 16:10; Job 14:13) — it is
   the universal realm of the dead, not an exclusively wicked destination (E139).

4. **The key verb describing gehenna is apollumi (destroy), not basanizo (torment)**
   — Matt 10:28 (E142). Torment vocabulary (basanismos) is absent from all 12 gehenna
   passages (E143).

5. **Isaiah 66:24 — source of the gehenna imagery** — the objects on which the worm and
   fire act are pigrê (H6297, corpses/dead bodies), not conscious persons (E141).

6. **"Eternal fire" = permanent result**: Sodom's "eternal fire" (Jude 1:7) produced
   "ashes" (2 Pet 2:6) — same event, same author (E147, N029).

7. **Tartaroo: strictly limited** — single occurrence (2 Pet 2:4), verb form, applies
   only to fallen angels, describes pre-judgment "chains of darkness," not fire or torment
   (E145, E146).

8. **Explicit torment passages exist** (ECT E-items): Rev 20:10 (devil/beast/false prophet
   tormented day and night for ever — E149); Rev 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers tormented,
   smoke ascending for ever — E150). These appear OUTSIDE all four "hell" words.

**Evidence item range:** E137–E150, N027–N029, IA016–IA017, IB008 (new from etc5-05)

## etc5-08 — Aionios (G166) in the New Testament

**Key findings relevant to Study 16:**

1. **Aionios (G166) is NOT inherently forward-pointing endless.** It is formed as
   aion + -ios ("age-pertaining"), not as an alpha-privative (N037). The word for
   inherent endlessness is aidios (G126, from aei = "always") — only 2 NT occurrences.

2. **Aionios demonstrably refers to past elapsed time** (Rom 16:25; 2Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2)
   — the BLB definition explicitly acknowledges "also used of past time, or past and future
   as well" (E197, E198, N036).

3. **Duration is contextually determined by the nature of the referent** (N034/N035/N036).
   Aionios modifies: God's eternal attributes (genuinely endless), past ages (elapsed),
   mortal human relationship (Phm 1:15, bounded by lifespan), completed events (permanent
   result), Sodom's fire (produced ashes).

4. **Aidios (G126) vs. aionios (G166):** Paul uses aidios for God's intrinsic power
   (Rom 1:20) and aionios for eternal life throughout — two different words (E201). Jude
   uses aidios for fallen angels' ongoing active chains and aionios for Sodom's completed
   fire — in adjacent verses (E202).

5. **Mat 25:46:** The negative noun is kolasis (G2851 = penal infliction from kolazo =
   to prune/curtail), NOT basanismos (E209). IB012 resolved Moderate toward
   referent-nature interpretation.

6. **"For ever and ever" (eis tous aionas ton aionon)** uses G165 (plural noun aion),
   not G166 (adjective aionios). Applied to judgment: the grammatical subject of ascending
   smoke in Rev 14:11 is ho kapnos (THE SMOKE, N-NSM nominative — E211); three named
   subjects in Rev 20:10 (devil/beast/false prophet — E212).

7. **Torment vocabulary is confined to Revelation:** G929 (basanismos) — ALL 6 NT
   occurrences in Revelation only. G928 (basanizo) — eschatological uses ONLY in
   Revelation. Neither appears in any didactic epistle's eschatological teaching.

**Evidence item range:** E197–E218, N036–N037, IA022, IB012 (new from etc5-08)

## etc5-15 — The Strongest Biblical Case for ECT

**Key findings relevant to Study 16:**

1. **Three E-tier ECT items exist:**
   - E149: Rev 20:10 — devil, beast, false prophet tormented "day and night for ever and ever"
   - E150: Rev 14:10-11 — human beast-worshippers tormented; smoke of torment for ever and ever
   - E123: Luke 16:23-24 — rich man explicitly in torments in Hades

2. **Zero ECT arguments reach N tier** for the doctrine that ALL human wicked experience
   ongoing conscious torment forever. Every argument requires at least one interpretation
   step that fails the stricter N-tier tests.

3. **All 8 strongest ECT arguments land at I-B tier** for the ECT doctrine inference:
   - IB009 (Strong toward desolation): governs Rev 14:9-11 smoke formula and Mark 9 / Isa 66:24
   - IB015 (Moderate): governs Rev 20:10 — permanent/irrevocable judgment of specific entities
   - IB016 (Moderate AGAINST): governs Mat 25:41 same-fire extension
   - IB012 (Moderate toward referent-nature): governs Mat 25:46 symmetry
   - IB011 (Moderate toward referent-nature): governs Dan 12:2 grammatical symmetry
   - IB014 (Moderate toward judgment-process): governs "no rest day nor night"
   - IB008 (Moderate AGAINST universal extension): governs scope of torment language
   - IB006 (Moderate toward parabolic): governs Luke 16

4. **New from etc5-15:**
   - E282: Mark 9:48 verbs are present tense (ou teleutai, ou sbennytai); source text objects
     are pigrê (corpses)
   - E283: dir'on (H1860, "everlasting contempt" in Dan 12:2) = attitude of observers toward
     corpses in Isa 66:24 — not conscious experience of the condemned

5. **Running series totals after etc5-15:** 376 items total
   - Conditionalist: 169 (E:118; N:27; I-A:22; I-C:2)
   - ECT: 10 (E:7; N:0; I-A:0; I-D:3)
   - Neutral: 180 (E:158; N:19; I-A:3)
   - I-B competing evidence: 17 items

## Key I-D Item (Counter-Evidence External)

**ID001: Humans possess an inherently immortal soul surviving death in conscious existence.**
- This is the I-D (counter-evidence external to Scripture) item identified in etc5-05
- It overrides: E029/N005 (soul that sinneth shall die), E031/N006 (dust returns to dust),
  E024/N007, E026/N008
- Classification: ECT (direction)
- The Platonic concept of inherent soul-immortality is identified as an ECT-direction
  external claim that Study 16 (historical-theological study) should investigate for
  its channel of entry into Christian theology
