## Primary Verses

### Matthew 25:41 (Everlasting Fire — Prepared for the Devil)

> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

**Context (Matthew 25:31-46 — The Sheep and Goats):**
> Matthew 25:31 — When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
> Matthew 25:32 — And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep from the goats:
> Matthew 25:33 — And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
> Matthew 25:34 — Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
> ...
> Matthew 25:40 — And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done [it] unto me.
> Matthew 25:41 — Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
> Matthew 25:42 — For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
> Matthew 25:43 — I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
> Matthew 25:44 — Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
> Matthew 25:45 — Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it] not to me.
> Matthew 25:46 — And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

**Key notes:**
- "Everlasting fire" (v.41) is described as "prepared for the devil and his angels" — dative of purpose
- "Everlasting punishment" (v.46) uses kolasis (G2851 — penal infliction/curtailment), not basanismos
- The same adjective aionion governs both outcomes (punishment and life) — identical grammatical form (A-ASF)
- No torment vocabulary (basanismos/basanizo) appears in this passage

### Matthew 25:46 (Everlasting Punishment / Eternal Life)

> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

*(Full context provided in Matthew 25:41 section above)*

**Greek vocabulary:**
- kolasis (G2851) = punishment/penal infliction — appears only twice in NT (Mat 25:46; 1Jn 4:18)
- aionion (G166) — same form (A-ASF) for both outcomes
- NOT basanismos (G929 = torment)

### Mark 9:43-48 (Worm Dieth Not / Fire Not Quenched)

> Mark 9:43 — And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
> Mark 9:44 — Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
> Mark 9:45 — And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
> Mark 9:46 — Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
> Mark 9:47 — And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:
> Mark 9:48 — Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
> Mark 9:49 — For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.

**Context (Mark 9:33-50 — Greatness and Stumbling Blocks):**
> Mark 9:33-34 — Dispute about who is greatest; Jesus corrects them
> Mark 9:35-37 — Whoever desires to be first must be servant of all
> Mark 9:38-40 — John reports someone casting out devils in Jesus' name
> Mark 9:41-42 — Whoever gives a cup of water; whoever offends little ones
> Mark 9:43-48 — Three-fold refrain on cutting off hand/foot/eye to avoid gehenna
> Mark 9:49-50 — Salted with fire; salt as metaphor for purity and peace

**Key notes:**
- Three-fold refrain: "where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" (vv.44, 46, 48)
- This is a direct quotation of Isaiah 66:24 (cross-testament tool: hybrid score 0.424)
- Source text (Isa 66:24): objects of worm and fire are pigrê (H6297 = corpses/dead bodies — E141)
- Verbs are present tense: "dieth not" (ou teleutai, V-PAI-3S) and "is not quenched" (ou sbennytai, V-PPI-3S)
- No torment vocabulary (basanismos/basanizo) in any of the three refrains

### Revelation 14:9-11 (Torment / Smoke Ascending)

> Revelation 14:9 — And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
> Revelation 14:10 — The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
> Revelation 14:11 — And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
> Revelation 14:12 — Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
> Revelation 14:13 — And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed [are] the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.

**Context (Revelation 14:1-13 — The 144,000 and Three Angels):**
> Rev 14:1 — Lamb standing on Mount Zion with 144,000
> Rev 14:6-7 — First angel: everlasting gospel; judgment hour come
> Rev 14:8 — Second angel: Babylon is fallen
> Rev 14:9-11 — Third angel: warning against beast-worship; torment language
> Rev 14:12-13 — Patience of saints; blessed dead who die in the Lord

**Key notes:**
- Specific subjects: those who "worship the beast and his image" and "receive the mark of his name"
- "He shall be tormented" (G928/basanizo) and "smoke of their torment" (G929/basanismos)
- "For ever and ever" (eis tous aionas ton aionon) — uses G165 (plural noun aion), NOT G166 (adjective)
- Top OT parallel: Isaiah 34:10 (score 0.401) — smoke of desolated Edom going up for ever
- E150 (ECT-direction explicit item): genuine torment language applied to human beast-worshippers
- "No rest day nor night" formula — cf. Rev 4:8 (four living creatures' unceasing worship, same phrase)
- Governed by IB009 (Strong toward permanent desolation) for the ECT doctrine inference

### Revelation 20:10 (Tormented Day and Night For Ever)

> Revelation 20:9 — And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
> Revelation 20:10 — And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
> Revelation 20:11 — And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
> Revelation 20:12 — And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
> Revelation 20:13 — And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
> Revelation 20:14 — And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
> Revelation 20:15 — And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

**Key notes:**
- Verse 9: Human armies are "devoured" (katephagen — destruction vocabulary) — different from v.10
- Verse 10: Three named subjects — the devil, the beast, and the false prophet — tormented for ever
- Verse 14: Death and hades cast into the lake of fire = the second death (hades ends here)
- Verse 15: General human wicked — "was cast into the lake of fire" — NO "tormented day and night for ever" language repeated
- Subject differentiation is within a single passage, same author (John), adjacent verses
- E149 (ECT-direction explicit item): strongest ongoing-torment passage in NT
- Governed by IB015 (Moderate toward permanent/irrevocable judgment of supernatural entities)

### Luke 16:19-31 (Rich Man and Lazarus)

> Luke 16:19 — There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
> Luke 16:20 — And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
> Luke 16:21 — And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
> Luke 16:22 — And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
> Luke 16:23 — And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
> Luke 16:24 — And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
> Luke 16:25 — But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
> Luke 16:26 — And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.
> Luke 16:27 — Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
> Luke 16:28 — For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
> Luke 16:29 — Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
> Luke 16:30 — And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
> Luke 16:31 — And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

**Context (Luke 16:1-31 — Chapter of Parables and Teachings on Wealth):**
> Luke 16:1-13 — Parable of the Unjust Steward
> Luke 16:14-18 — Pharisees ridiculed; law and prophets; marriage teaching
> Luke 16:19-31 — Rich Man and Lazarus account

**Key notes:**
- "Hell" in v.23 = hades (G86), not gehenna (G1067) — the pre-judgment state, not the final lake of fire
- Setting is the intermediate state between death and resurrection (hades), not the final eschatological state
- "Being in torments" (G931/basanos); "I am tormented" (G928/basanizo)
- E123 (ECT-direction explicit item): rich man is explicitly in torments in hades
- Governed by IB006 (Moderate toward parabolic): same literary introduction form as Lukan parables
- The climactic point (v.31) is sufficiency of Scripture, not eschatology
- The passage includes elements recognized as figurative (cooling flame with finger-dip of water)
- Literary context: immediately follows two parables about wealth (unjust steward; serving two masters)

### Daniel 12:2 (Everlasting Life / Everlasting Contempt)

> Daniel 12:1 — And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation [even] to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
> Daniel 12:2 — And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt.
> Daniel 12:3 — And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.

**Key notes:**
- "Everlasting life" (chayyê olam); "everlasting contempt" (dir'on olam)
- H5769 (olam) governs both outcomes — same word for both
- dir'on (H1860) appears ONLY in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24 — in Isa 66:24 it describes the attitude
  of observers toward the pigrê (corpses), not conscious experience of the condemned (E283)
- "They that sleep in the dust" — resurrection language; sleep in the dust = mortal dead
- NT top parallels for Dan 12:2 = Luke 18:30 and Mat 25:46 (age + alive keywords)
- The framing is "life vs. contempt" (reputation/legacy), not "life vs. torment"

### Isaiah 66:24 (Source Text of Gehenna Imagery)

> Isaiah 66:22 — For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
> Isaiah 66:23 — And it shall come to pass, [that] from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
> Isaiah 66:24 — And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.

**Key notes:**
- "Carcases" = pigrê (H6297 = corpses/dead bodies) — explicitly named objects of worm and fire (E141)
- "They shall be an abhorring" = dir'on — the attitude of observers ("all flesh") toward the condemned dead
- The passage is set in the new creation context (v.22 — new heavens and earth)
- Righteous look outward upon the remains of the wicked — the condemned are dead and visible as corpses
- The "shall not die / not quenched" language describes the permanence of the worm/fire acting on corpses
- NT top parallel: Mark 9:48 (score 0.424 — direct quotation; keywords: burn, die, worm)
- This is the primary OT source text Jesus quotes three times in Mark 9

### 2 Thessalonians 1:5-12 (Everlasting Destruction)

> 2 Thessalonians 1:5 — [Which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
> 2 Thessalonians 1:6 — Seeing [it is] a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
> 2 Thessalonians 1:7 — And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
> 2 Thessalonians 1:8 — In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
> 2 Thessalonians 1:9 — Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
> 2 Thessalonians 1:10 — When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.

**Key notes:**
- "Everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion) — olethros (G3639 = ruin, destruction) + aionion (G166)
- Paul's eschatological vocabulary: olethros (destruction) — NOT basanismos (torment)
- "From the presence of the Lord" — separation language, not torment language
- Consistent with Paul's other eschatological vocabulary: apollōntai (they perish) in Rom 2:12
- E116 (Conditionalist) from existing evidence base

### Matthew 3:7-12 (Unquenchable Fire — John the Baptist)

> Matthew 3:7 — But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
> Matthew 3:8 — Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
> Matthew 3:9 — And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to [our] father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
> Matthew 3:10 — And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
> Matthew 3:11 — I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and [with] fire:
> Matthew 3:12 — Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

**Key notes:**
- "Unquenchable fire" (asbestos = cannot be prematurely extinguished)
- "He will burn up the chaff" (katakaisei — compound verb = burned completely/consumed)
- Metaphor: chaff is burned COMPLETELY by the unquenchable fire — the fire is unquenchable because
  it burns to completion, not because it burns forever
- Imagery consistent with Isa 66:24 destruction framing

---

### Jude 1:6-7 (Eternal Chains / Eternal Fire)

> Jude 1:6 — And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
> Jude 1:7 — Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

**Context (Jude 1:1-25 — entire letter):**
> Jude 1:1-4 — Greeting; contend for the faith against ungodly persons
> Jude 1:5-7 — Three historical examples: Israel destroyed in wilderness; angels in chains; Sodom
> Jude 1:8-16 — Application to false teachers
> Jude 1:17-25 — Exhortation to believers

**Key notes:**
- Two consecutive verses (6 and 7) use two different Greek words for duration:
  - Verse 6: "everlasting chains" — aidios (G126, from aei = "always/continually") — ONGOING
  - Verse 7: "eternal fire" — aionios (G166, "pertaining to the age") — COMPLETED RESULT
- The Sodom "eternal fire" = "turned to ashes" (2 Pet 2:6, same Petrine letter tradition)
- Jude uses the STRONGER "inherent endlessness" word (aidios) for fallen angels' chains (still active)
- Jude uses the SOFTER "age-pertaining" word (aionios) for Sodom's fire (completed, produced ashes)
- N029 (Neutral Necessary Implication): "eternal fire" = permanent result, not ongoing burning process

---

### 2 Peter 2:4-9 (Tartaroo and Three Examples)

> 2 Peter 2:4 — For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
> 2 Peter 2:5 — And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person], a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
> 2 Peter 2:6 — And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
> 2 Peter 2:7 — And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:
> 2 Peter 2:8 — (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds;)
> 2 Peter 2:9 — The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:

**Key notes:**
- "Cast them down to hell" translates the single Greek verb tartaroo (G5020) — a verb, not a noun
- Tartaroo = "to incarcerate in Tartaros" — refers to the mythological Greek deepest abyss
- Applied exclusively to fallen angels — never to humans
- Characterization: "chains of darkness" — not fire, not torment
- Temporal: "reserved unto judgment" — pre-judgment temporary state (E145, E146)
- 2 Pet 2:6: Sodom turned to ashes — confirms Jude 1:7's "eternal fire" = ashes (E147, N029)
- Context: Three examples of divine judgment and rescue (angels, flood, Sodom)

---

### Revelation 21:8 (Lake of Fire — Second Death)

> Revelation 21:7 — He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
> Revelation 21:8 — But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

**Key notes:**
- Lake of fire = "the second death" — identified by name as DEATH, not TORMENT
- "Shall have their part" — cast in language, not torment language
- Definition: "the second death" — the lake of fire IS death, by explicit textual identification (E113)
- No basanismos vocabulary in this verse

---

### Isaiah 34:8-10 (Edom's Smoke — "For Ever" Formula as Desolation)

> Isaiah 34:8 — For [it is] the day of the LORD'S vengeance, [and] the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.
> Isaiah 34:9 — And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
> Isaiah 34:10 — It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
> Isaiah 34:11 — But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

**Key notes:**
- "Smoke thereof shall go up for ever" — top OT parallel for Rev 14:11 (hybrid score 0.401)
- "It shall not be quenched night nor day" — present-tense language for a desolated wasteland
- Edom's judgment = permanent desolation (birds and wild animals dwell there — v.11, not ongoing fire)
- The "for ever" / "for ever and ever" smoke formula = established permanent desolation idiom
- IB009 (Strong toward permanent desolation): this OT precedent within the same book (Isaiah)
  demonstrates that the smoke-for-ever formula is a desolation idiom, not a conscious-experience formula

## Cross-Testament Parallels

### REV 14:11 — Top OT Parallels

| Reference | Score | Key Terms | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Isa 34:10 | 0.401 | age, burn, continual, forever | Top match — Edom desolation smoke formula |
| 2 Kgs 16:4 | 0.337 | burn | Low thematic |
| Num 16:35 | 0.327 | burn | Fire from the LORD consumes |
| Joel 2:2 | 0.308 | age, forever | Darkness/cloud; day of the LORD |

**Significance:** The top parallel for Rev 14:11 is Isa 34:10 — a passage describing the desolation
of Edom, not the conscious suffering of persons. The "smoke for ever" formula is a permanent-desolation
idiom in the OT source texts.

### REV 20:10 — Top OT Parallels

| Reference | Score | Key Terms | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Deut 13:6 | 0.364 | burn, prophet | False prophet theme |
| 2 Chr 18:22 | 0.353 | prophet | False prophet in royal court |
| 1 Kgs 22:23 | 0.352 | prophet | Lying spirit in prophets |
| Isa 34:10 | 0.332 | age, burn, forever | Desolation-smoke formula |

**Significance:** The "prophet" keyword cluster reflects the "false prophet" subject in Rev 20:10.
Isa 34:10 reappears (score 0.332) as the OT precedent for the eternal-fire formula.

### MAT 25:46 — Top OT Parallels

| Reference | Score | Key Terms | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Ezek 18:21 | 0.391 | alive | Life for the repentant wicked |
| Ps 119:93 | 0.391 | age, alive | Precepts give life |
| Ezek 18:24 | 0.368 | alive | Death for the apostate righteous |
| Ezek 33:14 | 0.362 | (none) | Turn from wickedness → live |

**Significance:** The top OT parallels for Mat 25:46 are from Ezekiel 18 — passages about the
wicked turning to life or dying in their wickedness. The two-outcome framework (life vs. death)
anchors Mat 25:46 in Ezekiel's life/death framework, NOT in a life/torment framework.

### ISA 66:24 — Top NT Parallels

| Reference | Score | Key Terms | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Mark 9:48 | 0.424 | burn, die, worm | Direct quotation — top match |
| Rev 17:16 | 0.368 | burn, flesh | Burning of the whore |
| Jud 1:23 | 0.330 | burn, flesh | Pulling from the fire |
| 1 Cor 15:32 | 0.329 | die | If dead do not rise |
| Mat 25:41 | 0.311 | burn | Everlasting fire |

**Significance:** Mark 9:48 is the clear top NT parallel to Isa 66:24 (score 0.424) — confirming
the direct quotation. The keywords driving the match are "burn, die, worm" — not torment vocabulary.

### DAN 12:2 — Top NT Parallels

| Reference | Score | Key Terms | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Luke 18:30 | 0.343 | age, alive | Eternal life for those who follow |
| Mat 25:46 | 0.334 | age, alive | Everlasting punishment/life |
| 2 Cor 2:16 | 0.324 | alive | Aroma of life vs. death |
| Gal 6:8 | 0.313 | age, alive | Sow to Spirit → reap eternal life |
| 1 Jn 5:11 | 0.312 | age, alive | Life is in the Son |

**Significance:** The dominant NT parallels for Dan 12:2 cluster around "age + alive" keywords.
The two-outcome framing in Dan 12:2 maps onto NT eternal life passages, not NT torment passages.
The negative outcome in Dan 12:2 (shame/contempt) does not generate torment-vocabulary matches
in the NT parallel corpus.

## Additional Context Passages

### Isaiah 33:14 (Everlasting Burnings — Zion Judgment Context)

Referenced in Nave's FIRE — EVERLASTING FIRE and PUNISHMENT — ETERNAL:

> Isaiah 33:14 — The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

Note: This verse asks rhetorically who can endure God's fire — the context is divine presence/holiness,
not post-mortem eschatological punishment. The "everlasting burnings" describe God's consuming holiness.

### Revelation 19:3 (Babylon's Smoke — Same Formula)

> Revelation 19:3 — And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.

This verse uses the identical "smoke rose up for ever and ever" formula as Rev 14:11 — but applied to
Babylon, which is described in the same vision as "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21). The smoke-for-ever
formula within Revelation itself is used for permanent desolation, not ongoing conscious experience.
This is the within-book demonstration that governs IB009 (Strong toward permanent desolation).

### Matthew 10:28 (God Destroys Body and Soul in Gehenna)

> Matthew 10:28 — And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

- "Hell" = gehenna (G1067)
- "Destroy" = apollumi (G622 = to destroy fully/perish) — NOT basanizo (to torment)
- E026 (Conditionalist) and E142 (Neutral): The key verb for what happens in gehenna is destroy, not torment
