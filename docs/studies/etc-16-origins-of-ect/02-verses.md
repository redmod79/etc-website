## Question
Historical investigation: What are the historical channels through which the doctrine of ECT entered Christian theology?

## Primary Verses -- Biblical Framework on Immortality

### Genesis 2:7
> And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

**Relevance:** The creation formula. Man BECAME a living soul -- not "received an immortal soul." This is the biblical starting point that Platonic philosophy contradicts.

### Genesis 3:19,22-24
> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

**Relevance:** God barred access to the tree of life specifically to prevent man from "living forever." This presupposes man is NOT inherently immortal.

### 1 Timothy 6:15-16
> Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
> Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.

**Relevance:** God ONLY (monos) has immortality (athanasia). If the soul were inherently immortal, this statement would be false.

### 1 Corinthians 15:50-54
> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
> Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

**Relevance:** Immortality is something mortals "must put on" at resurrection. It is not already possessed.

### Romans 2:5-8
> But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
> Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
> To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
> But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,

**Relevance:** Immortality must be SOUGHT. It is not inherent.

### 2 Timothy 1:9-10
> Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
> But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:

**Relevance:** Immortality was "brought to light through the gospel" -- it was not a known philosophical truth before Christ.

### Ezekiel 18:4
> Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.

**Relevance:** The soul CAN DIE. Contradicts Platonic teaching of innately immortal soul.

### Matthew 10:28
> And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

**Relevance:** God can DESTROY the soul. Contradicts innate immortality.

### Ecclesiastes 9:5-6
> For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
> Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.

**Relevance:** The dead lack consciousness. Contradicts both Platonic and ECT view of conscious afterlife.

### Psalm 146:3-4
> Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.

**Relevance:** At death, thoughts perish. Contradicts conscious intermediate state.

## Verses Used Historically to Build ECT Doctrine

### Matthew 25:41,46
> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

**Historical use:** The parallel between "everlasting punishment" and "life eternal" was used to argue both must be equally endless and conscious. (Examined in etc-08, etc-14.)

### Mark 9:43-48
> And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
> Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

**Historical use:** "Fire never quenched" and "worm dieth not" used for endless torment. (Quoting Isaiah 66:24, which describes corpses. Examined in etc-15.)

### Revelation 14:10-11
> The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

**Historical use:** "Tormented" and "smoke ascending forever" used for ECT. (Apocalyptic genre. Examined in etc-11.)

### Revelation 20:10
> And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

**Historical use:** "Tormented day and night forever" used for ECT. (Subjects are devil, beast, false prophet -- not literal humans. Examined in etc-12.)

### Luke 16:19-31 (Rich Man and Lazarus)
> And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
> And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

**Historical use:** Depicts conscious torment after death. (Parabolic genre. Examined in etc-09.)

## Verses on Philosophy

### Acts 17:16-19
> Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
> Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
> Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
> And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?

**Relevance:** Paul preached RESURRECTION to Greek philosophers who found this "strange" -- because Greeks believed in immortal souls, not bodily resurrection. The concept of resurrection was foreign to Platonic thought.

### Colossians 2:8
> Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.

**Relevance:** Paul warns against philosophy corrupting Christian teaching -- a warning that was historically not heeded regarding Platonic soul doctrine.

## Cross-Testament Parallels Found

### For 1 Timothy 6:16 (God only has immortality)
- OT parallel: Ps 49:20 (man like beasts that perish)
- NT parallels: 1 Tim 1:17 (King eternal, immortal); 1 Cor 15:50 (mortality/immortality)

### For Acts 17:18 (Paul encounters philosophers)
- No strong OT parallels (Greek philosophy post-dates OT)
