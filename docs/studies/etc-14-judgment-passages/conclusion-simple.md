# Judgment Passages — What the Bible Actually Says About the Fate of the Wicked

*Simplified summary of the study covering Rev 20:11-15, Matt 25:31-46, Dan 12:2, Isa 66:22-24, John 5:28-29, 2 Thess 1:7-10, Heb 10:26-31, Rom 2:5-11*

## Introduction

This study examines eight of the Bible's most important passages about final judgment, asking a straightforward question: what words does each passage actually use to describe what happens to the wicked? Rather than starting with a conclusion and reading it into the text, the approach is to look carefully at the vocabulary — especially the Greek and Hebrew words — and let the language speak for itself.

The two main views under examination are the annihilation view (conditionalism), which holds that the wicked are ultimately destroyed, and the eternal torment view (ECT), which holds that the wicked consciously suffer forever. Both views appeal to these same passages. The question is what the passages themselves say.

## What the Bible Says in Each Passage

### Revelation 20:11-15 — The Great White Throne

The dead are judged "according to their works" (vv.12-13). Those whose names are not in the book of life are "cast into the lake of fire." The text then defines what the lake of fire is: **"This is the second death"** (v.14). The word used is *thanatos* — death. The passage does not use the Greek word for torment (*basanizo*) when speaking of human beings.

### Matthew 25:46 — Everlasting Punishment and Eternal Life

Jesus says: **"these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal"** (v.46). The word translated "punishment" is the Greek *kolasis*, which means a penal penalty or infliction — it is not the Greek word for torment (*basanismos*). The same adjective (*aionios*, everlasting/eternal) modifies both outcomes. The text says the wicked receive *punishment*, not *torment*.

Notably, the "everlasting fire" in v.41 is described as "prepared for the devil and his angels" — its primary designation is for non-human entities.

### Daniel 12:2 — Everlasting Life and Everlasting Contempt

**"Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt"** (Dan 12:2). The word for "contempt" (*dera'on* in Hebrew) is rare — it appears only twice in the entire Old Testament: here and in Isaiah 66:24. In the Isaiah passage (see below), the objects of *dera'on* are dead bodies. The word describes how the dead are viewed by the living, not something the dead themselves experience.

### Isaiah 66:24 — Worm, Fire, and Carcasses

**"They shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh"** (Isa 66:24). The Hebrew word for "carcases" (*peger*) means dead body or corpse — it is used 22 times in the Old Testament and always refers to a dead body, never to a living person. The worm and fire act upon dead bodies.

The context confirms this: verses 16-17 state that "the slain of the LORD shall be many" and the transgressors "shall be consumed together" — they are slain and consumed before verse 24 describes their carcasses.

This passage shares its rare Hebrew word (*dera'on*, abhorring/contempt) with Daniel 12:2. Both passages describe the living looking upon the dead with horror — not the dead experiencing their own contempt.

### John 5:28-29 — Resurrection of Life, Resurrection of Judgment

**"They that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation"** (John 5:29). The word "damnation" here is the Greek *krisis*, which means judgment or decision — it appears five times in John 5 (vv.22, 24, 27, 29, 30) and always carries the sense of a judicial verdict. In verse 24, Jesus says those who believe have "passed from death unto life" — the opposite of life is death, and *krisis* is the judgment that brings that result.

### 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10 — Everlasting Destruction

Paul writes that those who do not obey the gospel **"shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord"** (2 Thess 1:9). The Greek word Paul uses for "destruction" is *olethros*, which appears four times in the New Testament (1 Cor 5:5; 1 Thess 5:3; 2 Thess 1:9; 1 Tim 6:9) and means destruction or ruin in every instance. Paul, writing a letter to a church with the aim of teaching clearly, does not use the word for torment — he uses the word for destruction.

### Hebrews 10:26-31 — Fire That Devours, Perdition vs. Salvation

The author writes of **"a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries"** (Heb 10:27). "Devour" (*katesthio*) means to consume or eat up — destruction vocabulary. The argument in verse 28 uses death as the standard: "He that despised Moses' law died without mercy." Verse 29 then asks about a "sorer punishment" — but the passage's own language for the outcome is "perdition" (*apoleia*, meaning destruction or ruin) in verse 39, contrasted with "saving of the soul." The binary is destruction versus salvation, not torment versus salvation.

### Romans 2:5-11 — Wrath, Tribulation, and Perishing

Paul writes that those who seek "glory and honour and immortality" receive "eternal life" (v.7). The word "immortality" (*aphtharsia*) is something believers seek and receive — it is not described as something all humans inherently possess. For the disobedient, Paul lists "indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish" (vv.8-9). Then verse 12 states the outcome plainly: **"as many as have sinned without law shall also perish"** (*apollymi* — to destroy, to perish). The concluding vocabulary is destruction.

## The Pattern Across All Eight Passages

When you look at the actual words used across these eight passages, a clear pattern emerges:

- **Four passages use explicit destruction or death vocabulary for the fate of the wicked:** Revelation 20 ("second death"), 2 Thessalonians 1 ("everlasting destruction"), Hebrews 10 ("devour," "perdition"), Romans 2 ("perish").
- **Two passages use penalty or judgment vocabulary without specifying the nature of the outcome:** Matthew 25 ("punishment"), John 5 ("judgment").
- **Two passages describe the dead as objects of abhorrence to the living:** Daniel 12 ("everlasting contempt"), Isaiah 66 ("carcasses," "abhorring").

Across all eight passages, not one uses the Greek word for torment (*basanizo* or *basanismos*) when referring to human beings.

## Where the Two Views Agree and Disagree

### What Both Views Must Agree On

The text straightforwardly establishes several things that neither view can honestly dispute:

- The lake of fire is called "the second death" (Rev 20:14).
- Matthew 25:46 uses *kolasis* (punishment/penalty), not the word for torment.
- The Hebrew *dera'on* (contempt/abhorring) appears only in Daniel 12:2 and Isaiah 66:24, and in the Isaiah passage its objects are dead bodies (*peger*).
- Isaiah 66:24 describes *peger* — corpses — as the subjects of the worm and fire.
- Paul's word in 2 Thessalonians 1:9 is *olethros*, which means destruction in all four of its New Testament occurrences.
- Romans 2:7 says immortality must be sought and received; the same passage says sinners "perish."

### The Key Dispute: What Do "Punishment" and "Contempt" Mean?

The main claims of the eternal torment view in these passages are that:

1. "Everlasting punishment" (Matt 25:46) means eternal conscious torment, because the same adjective (*aionios*) modifies both "punishment" and "life."
2. "Everlasting contempt" (Dan 12:2) means the wicked forever consciously experience their shame.

But both claims require adding something the text does not say. The first claim requires interpreting *kolasis* (punishment) as meaning ongoing conscious suffering — yet the word means penalty or penal infliction, and Paul's own word for the same event (2 Thess 1:9) is *destruction*. The second claim requires treating *dera'on* as an experience of the wicked — yet the only other place the word appears (Isa 66:24) makes the objects dead bodies.

The eternal torment view of 2 Thessalonians 1:9 requires that "everlasting destruction" actually means something like "everlasting conscious existence in a ruined state" — which requires changing what the word *olethros* means.

## What the Text Does and Does Not Say

**The text says:**
- The fate of the wicked is called "the second death," "everlasting destruction," "perdition," "devouring," and "perishing."
- Immortality is something received by those who seek it, not an inherent human attribute.
- The worm and fire of Isaiah 66 act on corpses.
- "Everlasting contempt" (Dan 12:2) uses a word that, in its only other biblical occurrence, describes how the living view dead bodies.

**The text does not say:**
- That any of these eight passages uses the word for torment (*basanizo*) when speaking of human beings.
- That *kolasis* (punishment) means conscious ongoing suffering rather than a penal act.
- That *dera'on* (contempt/abhorring) is something the wicked themselves experience.
- That *olethros* (destruction) means an ongoing conscious existence in ruin.
- That the "tribulation and anguish" of Romans 2:9 last forever (the same passage uses "perish" as the outcome).

## Conclusion

Across these eight major passages on final judgment, the vocabulary the biblical authors actually chose leans consistently toward death and destruction rather than ongoing conscious torment. Four of the eight passages use straightforward destruction or death language. Two use judgment language that leaves the nature of the outcome unspecified. Two describe the dead as objects of horror to the living — not as conscious sufferers.

The case for eternal torment in these passages rests not on what the text says but on what must be inferred: that "punishment" means ongoing torment, that "contempt" is experienced, that "destruction" means conscious ruin. These inferences are possible, but they require adding to the text what the text does not supply.

The passages themselves, read at the level of their actual vocabulary, describe the fate of the wicked primarily in the language of death, destruction, and perishing — the second death, everlasting destruction, devoured, perdition, perishing. That is what the Bible says in these passages.
