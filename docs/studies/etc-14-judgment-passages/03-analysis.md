## Methodology

Following ETC5 Series Methodology (etc5-series-methodology.md). This study examines ten major judgment passages not deeply analyzed in prior studies. Evidence is classified as Explicit (E), Necessary Implication (N), or Inference (I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D). Prior established items are cited by master ID and marked as such. New items are assigned next available IDs (E268+, N043+).

## SECTION 1: REVELATION 20:11-15 — THE GREAT WHITE THRONE

### The Passage

**Rev 20:11** — "And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them."

**Rev 20:12** — "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works."

**Rev 20:13** — "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works."

**Rev 20:14** — "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."

**Rev 20:15** — "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."

### What the Text States

1. The scene opens with a throne; the cosmos flees from the one seated on it (v.11).
2. "The dead, small and great" stand before the throne — universal scope (v.12).
3. "Books" (biblia) are opened, and "another book" — the book of life — is also opened (v.12).
4. The dead are "judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works" (v.12) — the judgment criterion is works (erga), recorded in books.
5. The sea, death, and Hades all deliver up their dead (v.13) — a universal gathering.
6. "They were judged every man according to their works" (v.13) — repeated.
7. Death and Hades are cast into the lake of fire — identified as "the second death" (v.14). [Already established: E110]
8. Whoever is not found in the book of life is cast into the lake of fire (v.15). [Already established: E111]

### Greek Parsing Observations

The judgment verb in vv.12-13 is ekrithēsan (G2919 krinō, V-API-3P = Aorist Passive Indicative 3rd Plural) — "were judged." The word krinō means to judge, evaluate, render a verdict. This is standard judicial vocabulary. No basanizō (torment) language appears anywhere in vv.11-15.

The dead "stand" (hestōtas — G2476, V-RAP-APM = Perfect Active Participle) before the throne — a completed-state participle indicating they are in the state of standing/having taken their position.

### OT Background — Dan 7:9-10

The Great White Throne scene inherits its imagery from Daniel 7:9-10: "I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit... the judgment was set, and the books were opened." The same elements: a throne, a seated judge, opened books, judgment. The Daniel passage provides the OT framework for the Rev 20 judgment scene without specifying the duration of punishment in torment-language.

### What ECT Infers

ECT reads Rev 20:15 — being cast into the lake of fire — as the beginning of eternal conscious torment, importing the torment language of Rev 20:10 (established E149, reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit) into Rev 20:15. The argument: the lake of fire is the same location described in Rev 20:10 with "tormented day and night for ever and ever," so all cast into it experience this.

### What Conditionalism Infers

Conditionalism reads Rev 20:15 — being cast into the lake of fire = the second death (by Rev 20:14's identification) — as final destruction/cessation, consistent with the "death" name and the destruction vocabulary. The torment-for-ever formula is applied only to the three named supernatural entities in Rev 20:10, not to humans in v.15. (Established: IB008, Moderate weight AGAINST universal extension.)

## SECTION 2: MATTHEW 25:31-46 — THE SHEEP AND THE GOATS

### The Passage

**Mat 25:31-33** — The Son of man sits on his throne; all nations are gathered; separated as sheep from goats.

**Mat 25:34** — To the righteous: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."

**Mat 25:41** — To the wicked: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."

**Mat 25:46** — "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."

### What the Text States

1. The judgment is universal in scope — "all nations" (panta ta ethnē, v.32).
2. The criterion for separation is treatment of "the least of these" — deeds of mercy/neglect (vv.35-45).
3. The fire sent to the wicked is "everlasting fire" (pyr aiōnion, v.41) — fire with aionios modifier.
4. The fire was "prepared for the devil and his angels" — the stated intended recipients are supernatural entities (v.41). [Already established: E118, E214]
5. The wicked "shall go away into everlasting punishment" (kolasin aiōnion, v.46). [Already established: E119]
6. The righteous go into "life eternal" (zōen aiōnion, v.46). [Already established: E208]
7. The same adjective (aionion, A-ASF) modifies both outcomes. [Already established: E208]
8. The punishment word is kolasis (G2851 = penal infliction/pruning), not basanismos (torment). [Already established: E209]

### The Fire Prepared "for the Devil and His Angels"

The text says the everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels (v.41). This is the stated preparation purpose — supernatural entities. The wicked are directed into this fire at judgment, but the fire's design is stated as for the devil and his angels. This connects to the parousia judgment where the three named supernatural entities receive the torment-for-ever formula (Rev 20:10) and the fire was said to be prepared for them.

ECT reads: the fire prepared for the devil encompasses all who join the devil's side; therefore all the wicked experience ongoing torment in it.

Conditionalism reads: the fire prepared for the devil is the lake of fire (Rev 19:20; 20:10) where the devil is tormented, but the second death for humans is different in character while in the same location.

### The Kolasis/Aionios Observation

The word kolasis (G2851) occurs only twice in the NT: Mat 25:46 and 1 Jn 4:18 (fear hath torment = kolasis). Its root kolazō means to prune, curtail, restrain, chastise. It is not the torture/torment vocabulary (basanizō). The passage uses an aionios adjective to describe both outcomes. [Already established: E208, E209]

## SECTION 3: DANIEL 12:2 — EVERLASTING CONTEMPT

### The Passage

**Dan 12:2** — "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."

### What the Text States

1. Those who are currently sleeping (in death) in the dust shall awake — a resurrection from death's sleep.
2. Two outcomes: everlasting life (chayyê olam) vs. shame and everlasting contempt (lederaon olam).
3. The word for "contempt" is dir'on (H1860) — an abhorring/loathing/repulsion.
4. Dir'on (H1860) appears only twice in all Hebrew Scripture: Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24 ("they shall be an abhorring [dir'on] unto all flesh"). [Already established: E193]
5. In Isa 66:24, the objects of the dir'on are pigrê (H6297 = corpses/dead bodies). [Already established: E141]

### The Dir'on Lexical Connection

The lexical link between Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24 is significant: the same word dir'on appears in both, and in Isa 66:24 the objects of this abhorring are explicitly stated to be corpses. This means "everlasting contempt" in Dan 12:2 shares its vocabulary with "abhorring of corpses" in Isa 66:24.

The dir'on itself is a description of how others regard the judged — an external relational assessment ("they shall be an abhorring") — not necessarily a description of what the judged subjectively experience. One can be held in contempt or regarded with loathing after death, without the object of that loathing consciously experiencing the contempt.

### What ECT Infers

ECT reads "everlasting contempt" as pointing to conscious, ongoing shame — the wicked experience perpetual shame and awareness of their contemptible state before God forever.

### What Conditionalism Infers

Conditionalism reads "everlasting contempt" as indicating that the fate of the wicked — identified as corpses in the parallel Isa 66:24 — is permanently regarded as loathsome. The "everlasting" modifies the permanence of the verdict/regard, not necessarily the ongoing subjective experience of the judged.

## SECTION 4: ISAIAH 66:22-24 — THE NEW CREATION CONTEXT

### The Passage

**Isa 66:22** — "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain."

**Isa 66:23** — "And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD."

**Isa 66:24** — "And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh."

### What the Text States

1. The setting is the new creation (new heavens and new earth, v.22).
2. Universal worship: all flesh comes to worship before God (v.23).
3. The righteous in the new creation "go forth and look upon" something (v.24).
4. What they look upon: pigrê (H6297, plural construct) — **carcases / dead bodies** — of the men who transgressed (v.24). [Established: E141]
5. "Their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched" — permanence of the worm and fire.
6. "They shall be an abhorring [dir'on] unto all flesh" — the corpses are the abhorring (v.24). [Established: E193]

### The Objects Are Corpses

The Hebrew pigrê is the plural construct of peger (H6297 = corpse, dead body). BDB: "corpse, carcass" — consistently used for dead, lifeless bodies. The text specifies that what the righteous look upon are corpses — not living persons in torment, but the bodies of those who transgressed.

Mark 9:44,46,48 quotes Isa 66:24 verbatim ("where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched") — confirmed by the cross-testament parallel tool (highest NT parallel for Isa 66:24, score 0.424). [Established: E144]

### The New Creation Context

The scene is post-final-judgment: new heavens and earth exist (v.22), universal worship is occurring (v.23), and the righteous go forth from the new creation to see the result of the judgment (v.24). The worm and fire act on corpses in this new creation context, not on living tormented persons in a separate torment-chamber.

ECT reads: the undying worm and unquenched fire point to conscious eternal torment — the worm and fire cannot die or go out because the persons being consumed do not die.

Conditionalism reads: the worm and fire act on pigrê (corpses) — the worm and fire are permanent/undying because the judgment's effect is permanent, not because the objects are conscious. The fire is unquenched in the sense that it is not extinguished until its work is complete and permanent.

## SECTION 5: JOHN 5:28-29 — THE RESURRECTION OF DAMNATION

### The Passage

**Jhn 5:28** — "Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,"

**Jhn 5:29** — "And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."

### Greek Analysis

N1904 Greek text of Jhn 5:29: **καὶ ἐκπορεύσονται οἱ τὰ ἀγαθὰ ποιήσαντες εἰς ἀνάστασιν ζωῆς, οἱ τὰ φαῦλα πράξαντες εἰς ἀνάστασιν κρίσεως.**

The two destinations:
- Resurrection of life = anastasin ZŌĒs (G2222 zōē = life, G-GSF)
- Resurrection of "damnation" = anastasin KRISEŌs (G2920 krisis = judgment/condemnation, G-GSF)

The KJV renders kriseōs as "damnation" — but the Greek word is krisis (judgment/condemnation/verdict), not basanismos (torment). This is the only NT use where KJV renders krisis as "damnation." The word's primary meaning is the judicial process and verdict (34 NT occurrences: 52.9% = "judgment," 23.5% = "of judgment").

### What the Text States

1. "All that are in the graves" shall come forth (v.28) — universal resurrection.
2. Two destinies: resurrection of life vs. resurrection of judgment/condemnation (v.29).
3. Both are called "resurrection" (anastasis) with a genitive attribute indicating outcome.
4. The negative outcome is named krisis (judgment/verdict), not basanismos (torment).
5. John 5:24 provides the antithesis: "shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life" — believers are spared the judgment-verdict.

### What ECT Infers

ECT reads: "resurrection of damnation" indicates a resurrection unto eternal conscious suffering — the damnation IS the experience of ongoing torment. Krisis encompasses the full judicial process and its execution, which includes perpetual torment.

### What Conditionalism Infers

Conditionalism reads: the resurrection of krisis is a resurrection to face the judicial verdict — the verdict that results in the second death (the lake of fire, Rev 20:14). Krisis is the VERDICT, not the ongoing experience. The resurrection leads to the judgment scene (Rev 20:11-15), after which those not in the book of life are cast into the lake = second death. The name of the destination (krisis = verdict) rather than (basanismos = torment) is consistent with the judgment-vocabulary of Rev 20:12 (ekrithēsan = were judged).

## SECTION 6: 2 THESSALONIANS 1:7-10 — DESTRUCTION AT THE PAROUSIA

### The Passage

**2Th 1:7-10** — "...when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; When he shall come to be glorified in his saints..."

### Greek Analysis (N1904 — 2Th 1:9)

**οἵτινες δίκην τίσουσιν ὄλεθρον αἰώνιον ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου**

- diken tisousinEN = "shall suffer the judicial penalty" (tino = to pay/satisfy; dike = justice/penalty)
- OLETHRON AIŌNION = "everlasting DESTRUCTION" — olethros (G3639, ruin/destruction) is the direct object; aiōnion (G166) is the adjective modifying it
- apo prosōpou = "from the presence/face of the Lord"

### The Parousia Context

The entire passage frames the punishment within a specific eschatological event:
- v.7: "when the Lord Jesus shall be REVEALED from heaven" (apokaluphthēnai)
- v.8: "In flaming fire taking vengeance" — the fire accompanies the revealing
- v.9: "who shall suffer everlasting destruction" — punishment tied to the event
- v.10: "WHEN he shall come" — the hotan clause explicitly brackets the judgment to the moment of the parousia

The destruction occurs at the appearing of Christ. It is not described as a process that has been ongoing since death; it is an event at the Lord's appearing. [Previously established: E116, E210]

### Apo Prosōpou — "From the Presence of the Lord"

The phrase apo prosōpou (G575 + G4383) occurs in contexts where God's presence destroys:
- Ps 68:2 (LXX): "the wicked perish at [apo] the presence of God" (E175) — presence as agent of destruction
- Ps 9:3 (LXX): "thine enemies fall and perish at thy presence" — same idiom
- Isa 2:10,19,21: "hide from the terror of the LORD... the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth" — divine presence as devastating

The OT semantic register of "from the presence" is that the presence itself is the destructive agent — not that the wicked are banished to live in separation from God. [Previously established: IB010, Moderate weight against separation/banishment reading.]

## SECTION 7: HEBREWS 10:26-31 — FEARFUL JUDGMENT

### The Passage

**Heb 10:26-27** — "For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."

**Heb 10:28-29** — "He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God..."

**Heb 10:30-31** — "Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."

### Greek Analysis (Heb 10:27)

N1904: **φοβερὰ δέ τις ἐκδοχὴ κρίσεως καὶ πυρὸς ζῆλος ἐσθίειν μέλλοντος τοὺς ὑπεναντίους.**

Key words:
- phoberà ekdochē (fearful expectation) — the anticipatory dread of coming judgment
- kriseōs (G2920 = judgment) — genitive, expectation of judgment
- puros zēlos (fire's zeal/fury) — the burning anger expressed as fire
- **esthiein** (G2068, V-PAN = to eat/devour) — the fire DEVOURS; consumption vocabulary

The action of the fire in Heb 10:27 is to "devour" (esthiein) the adversaries — not to torment them. This is consumption language (cf. E180: Rev 20:9 nations "devoured" by fire; IA019).

### The A Fortiori Argument (Heb 10:28-29)

The argument is a fortiori (from lesser to greater):
- Under Moses' law: violators died without mercy (physical death as penalty)
- Under the new covenant: those who trample the Son of God deserve "much sorer punishment" (pleiōn kolaseōs — greater/more abundant punishment/chastisement)

The argument establishes a spectrum of severity. It does not specify the form of the greater punishment as eternal conscious torment. The word for punishment here is kolasis (G2851 — the same word as Mat 25:46), not basanismos.

### What the Text Does and Does Not Say

The text says:
- There is a fearful expectation of judgment (krisis)
- The fire devours (esthiein — consumption)
- Vengeance belongs to God
- It is a fearful thing to fall into God's hands
- The punishment is "sorer" (greater) than death under Moses

The text does not say:
- The punishment involves eternal conscious torment
- The duration is explicitly "for ever and ever"

---

## SECTION 8: HEBREWS 6:1-2 — ETERNAL JUDGMENT AS FOUNDATIONAL DOCTRINE

### The Passage

**Heb 6:1-2** — "Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."

### What the Text States

1. "Eternal judgment" (krima aiōnion) is listed as one of six foundational (archai/archē) doctrines of Christian teaching.
2. It is paired with "resurrection of the dead" — the two are connected: resurrection leads to judgment.
3. The adjective aiōnion modifies krima (verdict/decision).

### Lexical Analysis

"Eternal judgment" (krima aiōnion): krima (G2917 = verdict, judicial decision, condemnation; 25 NT occurrences); aiōnion (G166 = age-long, pertaining to the age/era). The "eternal" modifier applied to judgment most naturally means the judgment whose verdict is permanent and irrevocable — a verdict that stands for the age without appeal or reversal, not that the process of torment continues eternally.

The context of Hebrews 6 is not a description of the content of the punishment but rather a statement of the settled/established doctrinal framework. "Eternal judgment" is the permanent, irreversible judicial verdict — the eschatological separation that is final.

This connects directly to:
- Jhn 5:29: resurrection of krisis — the judgment verdict
- Rev 20:12: ekrithēsan — were judged by works
- Heb 10:27: fearful expectation of krisis

### ECT and Conditionalist Readings

ECT: "eternal judgment" means the judgment leads to an eternal experience of punishment — the verdict results in eternal ongoing torment.

Conditionalism: "eternal judgment" means the judgment is permanent and irreversible — the verdict cannot be appealed, reversed, or commuted. The finality is "eternal," not the process.

Neither reading requires importing basanismos vocabulary to Heb 6:2; the text uses krima (verdict) not basanismos (torment).

## SECTION 9: ROMANS 2:5-11 — WRATH, INDIGNATION, TRIBULATION, ANGUISH

### The Passage

**Rom 2:5** — "But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;"

**Rom 2:6-9** — "Who will render to every man according to his deeds: To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;"

**Rom 2:10-12** — "But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good... For there is no respect of persons with God. For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish [apollymi] without law."

### Greek Analysis

**Rom 2:8 (N1904):** ὀργὴ (G3709, N-NSF) καὶ θυμός (G2372, N-NSM) — wrath and fury, both NOMINATIVE — these are the judicial outcomes appointed to the disobedient.

**Rom 2:9:** thlipsis (G2347 = tribulation/affliction/pressure) + stenochōria (G4730 = anguish/distress/narrowness) — these describe the consequence coming "upon every soul of man that doeth evil."

### Paul's Summary in v.12

The clincher in Paul's argument: **"shall also PERISH [apollymi — G622, G-FMI-3P] without law"** — Paul's own summary word for the ultimate fate of those who sinned is apollumi (destroy fully / perish completely), the destruction vocabulary established in etc5-06.

The wrath/indignation/tribulation/anguish vocabulary in vv.8-9 describes the judgment experience; v.12 uses apollumi for the terminal result. The two do not contradict: the judgment process involves wrath and tribulation, and the end is destruction (apollumi). No torment vocabulary appears.

### What the Text Does Not Specify

The passage does not specify the duration of the tribulation and anguish. It states these as the judicial consequences. Paul does not say "for ever and ever" here. The duration of the judgment experience is not stated; what is stated is that it comes "upon every soul of man that doeth evil."

---

## SECTION 10: ACTS 24:15 — RESURRECTION OF JUST AND UNJUST

### The Passage

**Act 24:15** — "And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."

### What the Text States

1. Paul affirms a resurrection of the dead — a future event.
2. The resurrection includes both categories: the just and the unjust.
3. Paul describes this as his "hope toward God" — his personal eschatological expectation.
4. Paul says the high priest and Pharisees themselves "also allow" (acknowledge/agree) this — it was common Jewish belief.
5. Cross-testament parallel tool confirms Acts 24:15 as the second closest NT parallel to Jhn 5:29 (score 0.411, with "resurrection" as the key shared term).

### Theological Significance

This passage is the briefest of the central texts, but its significance is structural: Paul affirms the two-resurrection framework that underlies all the judgment passages. The resurrection of the unjust leads to judgment (Jhn 5:28-29), to standing before the Great White Throne (Rev 20:12), and to the verdict determined by works. Acts 24:15 provides Paul's explicit testimony to this framework.

---

## SECTION 11: SUPPORTING PASSAGES

### Matthew 12:36-37 — Every Idle Word

**Mat 12:36** — "But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment."

**Mat 12:37** — "For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."

The judgment is described as a day of giving account (logon dōsousin = "shall give account/word"). The outcome is judicial: justification or condemnation (dikaiōthēsē / katakritēsē). No duration of conscious torment is specified; the day of judgment is the evaluation event.

### 2 Corinthians 5:10 — Judgment Seat of Christ

**2Co 5:10** — "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."

The "judgment seat" (bēma, G968 = the raised platform/tribunal for judicial decisions) of Christ is where works done in the body are evaluated. The criterion is deeds done "in his body" — physical embodied life evaluated at judgment. This is universal ("we must ALL appear") and covers both good and bad. The passage does not specify the duration of consequences; it specifies the universality of the evaluation.

Cross-testament parallel tool: 2Co 5:10 is the closest NT parallel to Jhn 5:29 (score 0.435 — "done, evil, good").

### Revelation 11:18 — Time of the Dead to be Judged

**Rev 11:18** — "And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth."

Key terms:
- "the time of the dead, that they should be judged" — the appointed eschatological moment for the dead to face judicial evaluation
- "give reward" to servants, prophets, saints
- "**destroy** them which destroy the earth" — the verb for the wicked is destroy (diaphtheirai — G1311 = to destroy utterly, ruin), not torment

Rev 11:18 identifies the judgment time as also the time when God destroys those who destroy the earth. Destruction vocabulary appears, not torment vocabulary, for the fate of the wicked at this judicial moment.

### New Explicit Statements (E Tier)

| Study E# | Explicit Statement | Reference | Classification | Master ID |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| E1 | "The dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened... and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works." The judgment criterion in the Great White Throne scene is works (erga) evaluated by written record. The judgment verb is krinō (judicial verdict), not basanizō (torment). | Rev 20:12 | Neutral | **NEW: E268** |
| E2 | "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." The Great White Throne judgment concludes: those not in the book of life go to the lake of fire. The book of life distinguishes the two outcomes. | Rev 20:15 | Conditionalist | Already E111 |
| E3 | "And there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust." Paul explicitly affirms two resurrections — of the just and the unjust — as his expressed hope. | Act 24:15 | Neutral | **NEW: E269** |
| E4 | "They that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation [kriseōs — G2920, N-GSF = judgment/condemnation]." In John 5:29, the negative resurrection destination is named with krisis (judgment/verdict), NOT basanismos (torment). The Greek word is kriseōs (genitive of krisis, G2920). | Jhn 5:29 | Neutral | **NEW: E270** |
| E5 | "And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases [pigrê — H6297 = corpses/dead bodies] of the men that have transgressed against me... and they shall be an abhorring [dir'on — H1860] unto all flesh." The objects seen by the righteous in the new creation setting are pigrê (corpses), and their condition is dir'on (abhorring). Setting: new heavens and new earth (v.22), universal worship (v.23). | Isa 66:22-24 | Neutral | Extends E141, E193 — **NEW context E271** |
| E6 | "For if we sin wilfully... But a certain fearful looking for of judgment [kriseōs] and fiery indignation, which shall devour [esthiein — G2068, Pres Act Inf = to eat/devour] the adversaries." The fire's action on adversaries in Heb 10:27 is described as eating/devouring (esthiein = consumption vocabulary), not as basanizō (torment). | Heb 10:27 | Neutral | **NEW: E272** |
| E7 | "Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment [krima aiōnion — G2917 + G166]." Hebrews 6:2 lists "eternal judgment" as one of six foundational Christian doctrines. The word for this judgment is krima (verdict/judicial decision), not basanismos (torment). It is paired with "resurrection of the dead." | Heb 6:2 | Neutral | **NEW: E273** |
| E8 | "But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation [thumos — G2372, N-NSM] and wrath [orgē — G3709, N-NSF], Tribulation [thlipsis — G2347] and anguish [stenochōria — G4730], upon every soul of man that doeth evil." Four judgment-vocabulary terms appear in Rom 2:8-9; none is basanismos or basanizō. | Rom 2:8-9 | Neutral | **NEW: E274** |
| E9 | "For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish [apollōntai — G622, V-FMI-3P: Fut Mid Ind Pl 3rd] without law." Paul's own summary word for the final fate of those who sinned without law is apollumi (perish/be destroyed), the destruction vocabulary. This appears in the same passage (Rom 2:12) immediately following the wrath/indignation/tribulation/anguish language of vv.8-9. | Rom 2:12 | Conditionalist | **NEW: E275** |
| E10 | "And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged... and shouldest destroy [diaphtheirai — G1311, Aorist Act Inf = to destroy utterly/ruin] them which destroy the earth." In Rev 11:18, the eschatological moment includes judgment of the dead AND destroying those who destroy the earth. The verb for the wicked's fate is diaphtheirō (destroy utterly), not basanizō. | Rev 11:18 | Conditionalist | **NEW: E276** |
| E11 | "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." Hebrews 10:31 — the conclusion of the Heb 10:26-31 judgment warning. The emphasis is the terror of divine judgment itself, not a specification of the duration or form of torment. | Heb 10:31 | Neutral | **NEW: E277** |
| E12 | "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared [hetoimasmenon — G2090, V-RPP-ASN = Perfect Passive Participle: already-prepared state] for the devil and his angels." The stated intended recipients of the fire are supernatural entities: the devil and his angels.

| E17 | Daniel 12:2 uses dir'on (H1860) for "contempt"; Isaiah 66:24 uses the same word (dir'on) for the "abhorring" of all flesh toward the carcases. In Isaiah 66:24, the objects that are the abhorring are pigrê (H6297 = corpses). Both are the same lexeme; both are in eschatological judgment contexts. The dir'on describes how the judged are REGARDED by others — an external relational assessment.

### New Necessary Implications (N Tier)

| Study N# | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why Unavoidable | Classification | Master ID |
|----------|----------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| N1 | The standard of evaluation at the Great White Throne is works (erga), determined by written record in books. The judgment is forensic (krino = judicial verdict), not described as the initiation of ongoing conscious torment. | E268 (Rev 20:12: krinō + erga); E111 (Rev 20:15: cast into lake); E110 (Rev 20:14: second death) | Rev 20:12 twice uses "according to their works" and the verb krinō (judicial verdict) — not basanizō. Both sides must acknowledge this as the stated criterion and judgment vocabulary. | Neutral | **NEW: N043** |
| N2 | Paul's own summary word for the fate of sinners in Romans 2 is apollumi (perish completely), the destruction vocabulary. This appears in the same passage (v.12) as the wrath/tribulation/anguish language of vv.8-9. | E275 (Rom 2:12: apollōntai); E274 (Rom 2:8-9: orge/thumos/thlipsis/stenochōria) | Same passage, same author, same argument: vv.8-9 describe the judgment experience; v.12 states the result as apollumi. Both sides must acknowledge what word Paul uses in v.12. | Conditionalist | **NEW: N044** |
| N3 | The resurrection of the wicked in John 5:29 is named "resurrection of judgment/condemnation" (anastasim kriseōs) using krisis (G2920 = judicial verdict), not anastasim basanismou (resurrection of torment). The negative resurrection is characterized by the verdict that follows it, not by the experiential content of torment. | E270 (Jhn 5:29: kriseōs G2920 confirmed); G2920 lexical data (34 NT occ, judgment vocabulary) | The Greek word kriseōs is G2920 (krisis = judgment/verdict) — a fact both sides must acknowledge. The KJV renders it "damnation" but the underlying Greek is not basanismos. Observable lexical fact. | Neutral | **NEW: N045** |
| N4 | The fire in Hebrews 10:27 is described by its consuming/devouring action (esthiein = to eat/devour, G2068) toward adversaries — not by basanizō (torment). Consumption vocabulary (esthiō) describes the fire's action in Heb 10:27 just as kataphagō (devour) describes fire's action on nations in Rev 20:9 (E180). | E272 (Heb 10:27: esthiein confirmed by parsing); E180 (Rev 20:9: katephagen = devoured) | Both texts use consumption vocabulary (eat/devour) for fire's action on humans in judgment contexts. Both sides must acknowledge that Heb 10:27 uses esthiō, not basanizō. Observable vocabulary fact. | Neutral | **NEW: N046** |

### Inferences (I Tier)

| Study I# | Claim | Type | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria | Classification | Master ID |
|----------|-------|------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| I1 | The Great White Throne judgment (Rev 20:11-15) establishes that all unsaved humans will be cast into the lake of fire/second death after being judged according to works — and the absence of torment vocabulary for humans in this passage is consistent with the conditionalist reading (lake = second death = actual death). | I-A | E268 (works-based judicial judgment, krinō); E111 (cast into lake, Rev 20:15); E110 (lake = second death, Rev 20:14); N043 (judgment criterion = works, forensic vocabulary); IA013 (second death = actual death — existing inference) | Systematizes E268, E111, E110, N043 into the conditionalist reading of the Great White Throne. Aligns with all E/N items; requires no E/N item to mean something other than its lexical value. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | **NEW: IA023** |
| I2 | The absence of basanizō/basanismos vocabulary from every major judgment passage except the specific subjects of Rev 14:10-11 and Rev 20:10 — combined with the presence of destruction vocabulary (apollumi, krinō, esthiō, diaphtheirō, olethros) in every other judgment passage — indicates that the torment vocabulary is specifically applied to the three named supernatural entities and specific tribulation-era class, while destruction vocabulary governs the general human judgment. | I-A | N033 (basanizo/basanismos lexically distinct from destruction vocabulary, confirmed in etc5-06); E272 (Heb 10:27: esthiein/consumption); E276 (Rev 11:18: diaphtheirō/destruction); E275 (Rom 2:12: apollōntai/perish); E274 (Rom 2:8-9: orge/thumos — no basanismos); E270 (Jhn 5:29: kriseōs — no basanismos); E268 (Rev 20:12: krinō — no basanizō); E210 (2Th 1:9: olethros — no basanismos) | Systematizes the complete vocabulary distribution across 10 judgment passages. All components are from E/N tables. Extends N033's established lexical separation to the specific passages in this study. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | **NEW: IA024** |
| I3 | The biblical judgment passages consistently describe judgment as a forensic/judicial event (books opened, works evaluated, verdict rendered by krinō) rather than as the initiation of ongoing conscious torment. The judicial framework of evaluation → verdict → execution governs the structure of every major judgment scene. | I-A | E268 (Rev 20:12: books, works, krinō); E273 (Heb 6:2: krima aiōnion — eternal verdict); N043 (forensic vocabulary confirmed); N045 (Jhn 5:29: named after verdict not torment); E270 (kriseōs = judgment/verdict); E279 (Mat 12:37: katakrithēsē = condemned by judicial verdict); E278 (2Co 5:10: bēma = tribunal) | Systematizes the shared forensic vocabulary across multiple passages into a pattern. The claim about "consistent judgment framework" requires systematizing — no single verse states "all judgment is forensic." | #5 (systematizing) | Neutral | **NEW: IA025** |
| I4 | The fire of Matthew 25:41 ("everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels") involves ongoing torment for human persons cast into it, just as it involves torment for the devil and his angels — the preparation for supernatural entities and the casting of humans into the same fire implies the same experience. | I-B | FOR: E149 (Rev 20:10: devil/beast/false prophet tormented day and night for ever in the lake; reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit); E118 (Mat 25:41: everlasting fire prepared for devil/angels — humans directed there); the fire is the same in both passages. AGAINST: E212 (Rev 20:10: torment formula explicitly applied ONLY to the three named entities, not to humans in Rev 20:15); IB008 (Moderate weight AGAINST universal extension of torment language); E267 (four distinct castings with distinct vocabulary in Rev 19-20). | Extension from the fire's design for supernatural entities to humans' experience in it. Requires inference step: same location = same experience. | #2 (choosing between same location = same experience vs. same location ≠ same experience); #5 (systematizing) | ECT | **NEW: IB016** |
| I5 | The "resurrection of damnation" (anastasim kriseōs) in John 5:29 includes ongoing eternal conscious suffering as the content of the damnation — krisis encompasses not just the verdict but the execution of eternal torment as the sentence. | I-B | FOR: E149 (Rev 20:10: torment for ever for the three entities in the lake, the destination of the damned; reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit); E150 (Rev 14:10-11: torment vocabulary for a class of the wicked; reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit); the verdict (krisis) leads to the sentence (torment). AGAINST: E270 (kriseōs = G2920, meaning judgment/verdict — word does not intrinsically mean torment); N045 (the resurrection is named after the judicial verdict, not basanismos); G2920 lexical data (34 NT occ — 0 translate to torment content; all = judgment vocabulary) | Requires reading the content of the "damnation" as torment — importing basanismos content into krisis vocabulary. The text names the destination after the verdict (krisis), not after the experience (basanismos). | #1 (adding the concept of ongoing torment to krisis); #2 (choosing between krisis = verdict and krisis = verdict-plus-execution-as-torment) | ECT | **NEW: IB017** |

### I-B Resolution Subsections

#### I-B Resolution: IB016 — Mat 25:41 everlasting fire: same experience for humans as for devil and angels?

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR (ECT): E149 (devil, beast, false prophet tormented day and night for ever in the lake of fire — Rev 20:10; reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit); E118 (Mat 25:41: everlasting fire prepared for devil and his angels, into which humans are directed); same fire = same experience.
- AGAINST: E212 (the torment-for-ever formula in Rev 20:10 is explicitly applied to the three named supernatural entities; Rev 20:15 casts generic human wicked into the lake without repeating the torment formula — same author, adjacent verses); IB008 (established Moderate weight AGAINST universal extension); E267 (four distinct castings with distinct vocabulary — torment formula applied only in event 2, second-death label only in event 3); E214 (the fire was prepared FOR the devil and his angels as stated recipients — humans are directed there secondarily).

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E149 (Rev 20:10) | Plain | Explicit torment formula for three named entities in apocalyptic vision. |
| E118 (Mat 25:41) | Plain | Everlasting fire prepared for devil/angels; humans directed into same fire. Didactic/discourse context. |
| E212 (Rev 20:10 + 20:15) | Plain | Same author, adjacent verses, same lake — torment formula applied only once, for three entities. Distributional fact. |
| E267 (four castings) | Contextually Clear | Structural analysis of Rev 19:20-20:15 showing distinct subjects and distinct vocabulary for each event. |
| IB008 (existing resolution) | Moderate | Established in etc5-13: weight AGAINST universal extension. |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
The distributional evidence (E212: adjacent verses, same author, same location, torment formula applied in v.10 but not v.15) is Plain and directly addresses the question. The inference requires extending the torment formula from its explicitly-stated subjects (three entities) to all humans cast into the same location. E212's distributional observation is an observable textual fact that both sides must acknowledge; the extension requires an inference step (same location = same experience).

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
Rev 20:15 (human wicked cast into lake without torment formula) interprets Mat 25:41 (everlasting fire prepared for devil/angels, humans directed there): the same author of Rev 20 describes the lake without the torment formula for human persons. The adjacent-verse SIS (#4a: shared author, shared book, shared vocabulary, proximate location) weighs against importing the torment formula from v.10 to v.15 for humans.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate — weight AGAINST universal extension of torment experience to human wicked.**
The torment formula is explicitly applied to three named supernatural entities in Rev 20:10; it is not applied to human wicked in Rev 20:15 by the same author in the same passage. The inference that humans experience the same torment requires adding a concept the text withholds from its description of human persons.

#### I-B Resolution: IB017 — John 5:29 "resurrection of damnation": does krisis include the content of eternal torment?

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR (ECT): E149 (torment for ever for the three entities in the same destination; reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit); E150 (torment vocabulary for beast-worshippers; reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit); the judicial verdict (krisis) leads to execution of the sentence, which ECT identifies as eternal torment.
- AGAINST: E270 (the word is kriseōs, G2920 = judgment/verdict, confirmed by parsing — NOT basanismos; N1904 Greek text unambiguous); N045 (the resurrection is named after the verdict, not after basanismos); G2920 lexical data: 34 NT occurrences, none translate to "torment," all represent judicial process/verdict vocabulary; the structural parallel to "resurrection of life" (zōēs = the substance of the outcome) shows kriseōs represents the character/verdict of the outcome, not the content of torment.

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**
| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E270 (Jhn 5:29: kriseōs G2920) | Plain | Greek parsing is unambiguous; the word is krisis not basanismos. Lexical fact. |
| G2920 occurrence data | Plain | 34 NT occurrences; 0 translate as torment; all = judgment vocabulary. Statistical lexical fact. |
| E149 (Rev 20:10) | Plain | Torment formula for three named entities — different passage, different subject. |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
The lexical data (kriseōs = G2920 in all 34 NT occurrences = judicial vocabulary, never torment) is unambiguous. Reading "resurrection of torment" into kriseōs requires adding the content of basanismos to a word that consistently means judicial verdict/process. The FOR-ECT evidence (E149, E150 — both reclassified Neutral in etc5-18 audit) applies to different subjects in different passages — importing it to Jhn 5:29 via a chain of inferences.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
The clear passages that use explicit torment vocabulary (basanizō/basanismos) for the wicked are Rev 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers) and Rev 20:10 (three entities). Those passages name the experience with the torment word. John 5:29 names the destination with the verdict word (krisis). The choice of word in Jhn 5:29 contrasts with those passages' explicit torment vocabulary.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate — weight AGAINST reading eternal conscious torment as the content of kriseōs.**
The Greek word in Jhn 5:29 is krisis (judgment/verdict), which in all 34 NT occurrences functions as judicial vocabulary. Reading torment content into kriseōs requires importing basanismos vocabulary that the text does not use. The resurrection is named after the judicial verdict, consistent with the Great White Throne's forensic judgment framework (Rev 20:12: ekrithēsan = were judged) and Hebrews 6:2's "eternal judgment" (krima aiōnion = permanent verdict).

## Verification Phase

**Step A (Verify E statements):**
- E268 (Rev 20:12 forensic judgment) — direct observation of the text's vocabulary: krinō, erga, books. Both sides must acknowledge.
- E269 (Acts 24:15 two resurrections) — direct quote of Paul's explicit statement. Both sides must acknowledge.
- E270 (Jhn 5:29 kriseōs) — confirmed by N1904 Greek parsing. Lexical fact.
- E271 (Isa 66:22-24 carcases in new creation) — combines E141 (pigrê = corpses) with E193 (dir'on) in the new creation context. Both previous E items confirmed; this E item adds the new creation setting context.
- E272 (Heb 10:27 esthiein = devour) — confirmed by Greek parsing (G2068 V-PAN). Lexical fact.
- E273 (Heb 6:2 krima aiōnion) — direct quote. Lexical observation.
- E274 (Rom 2:8-9 four wrath terms) — direct quote + parsing confirmation.
- E275 (Rom 2:12 apollōntai) — direct quote; G622 confirmed.
- E276 (Rev 11:18 diaphtheirō) — direct quote; vocabulary observation.
- E277 (Heb 10:31 fearful to fall into God's hands) — direct quote; emphasis observation.
- E278 (2Co 5:10 bēma of Christ) — direct quote; universal scope stated.
- E279 (Mat 12:36-37 condemned at judgment) — direct quote; katakrino vocabulary.
- E280 (Jhn 5:28 all in graves come forth) — direct quote.
- E281 (Rev 20:11 cosmos flees) — direct quote.
All E items pass the "both sides must acknowledge this as what the text says" test.

**Step B (Verify N statements):**
- N043: forensic vocabulary (krinō/erga) at Great White Throne — both sides must acknowledge these words appear; the inference about what this means for the nature of punishment is I-tier.
- N044: apollumi in Rom 2:12 in same passage as wrath/anguish — both sides must acknowledge the vocabulary. The inference about what this means for the final state is I-tier.
- N045: kriseōs = G2920, not basanismos — confirmed by Greek parsing. Lexical fact.
- N046: esthiein = G2068 in Heb 10:27 — confirmed by parsing. Lexical fact.
All N items pass the three N-tier tests (universal agreement, no interpretation, zero added concepts).

**Step C-F:** IA023-IA025 require only #5 (systematizing E/N items). IB016 and IB017 have E/N items on BOTH sides — correctly I-B. All I-D flags absent (no external concepts override E/N items). SIS connections documented for both I-B items.
