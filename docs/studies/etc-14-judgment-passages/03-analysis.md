# etc-14: Judgment Passages — Analysis

## Methodology
Each of the 8 major judgment passages is analyzed individually for what the text says versus what each side infers. Focus is on the actual vocabulary used in each passage. For passages covered in depth by prior studies, key findings are cross-referenced.

## Passage 1: Revelation 20:11-15 — Great White Throne Judgment

### What the Text Says
- A "great white throne" appears; earth and heaven flee from the one sitting on it (v.11)
- "The dead, small and great, stand before God" (v.12)
- Books are opened; "another book" is the book of life (v.12)
- The dead are "judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works" (v.12)
- The sea, death, and hades deliver up their dead; judged "every man according to their works" (v.13)
- "Death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." (v.14)
- "Whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." (v.15)

### Vocabulary Analysis
- The judgment process: "judged" (krino) "according to their works" — judgment by works, not by belief system
- The outcome for death/hades: "cast into the lake of fire" — death itself is destroyed *(Examined in depth in etc-13-lake-of-fire-second-death.)*
- The outcome for humans not in the book of life: "cast into the lake of fire" — the same destination as death/hades
- The text's identification: "This is the second death" (thanatos vocabulary)
- No torment vocabulary is used for human subjects in vv.11-15
- The torment formula (Rev 20:10) is in a separate verse applied to the devil, beast, and false prophet *(Examined in depth in etc-12-devil-beast-false-prophet.)*

### What Each Side Infers
- **Conditionalist inference:** Humans cast into the lake of fire experience "the second death" (thanatos) — death, not torment. The text's own vocabulary identifies the outcome as death.
- **ECT inference:** Being cast into the lake of fire means eternal conscious torment because Rev 20:10 describes torment in the same lake. The claim requires importing the torment formula from v.10 (non-human subjects) to v.15 (human subjects), despite the text using different vocabulary.

### Genre Note
This passage is apocalyptic vision literature. The genre includes symbolic imagery (books, thrones, sea/death/hades personified). The text provides its own interpretation of the lake: "This is the second death."

## Passage 2: Matthew 25:31-46 — Sheep and Goats

### What the Text Says
- The Son of man comes in glory, sits on throne, separates nations as sheep from goats (vv.31-33)
- Sheep (right hand): "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you" (v.34)
- Goats (left hand): "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels" (v.41)
- The everlasting fire was "prepared for the devil and his angels" — its primary designation is for non-human entities
- "These shall go away into everlasting punishment [kolasin aionion]: but the righteous into life eternal [zoen aionion]" (v.46)

### Vocabulary Analysis
- "everlasting fire" (pur aionion) — fire described as aionios; fire's primary designation is for the devil and his angels
- "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion) — G2851 kolasis, appearing only here and 1 John 4:18 in the entire NT. kolasis = penal infliction/punishment. Derived from kolazo (to curtail, prune, restrain).
- "life eternal" (zoen aionion) — G2222 zoe + G166 aionios
- The same adjective aionios modifies both kolasis (punishment) and zoe (life) *(aionios examined in depth in etc-08-greek-aionios-aion.)*
- The text does not specify the nature of the punishment — it does not say "everlasting torment" (basanismos) or "everlasting suffering." It says kolasis (punishment/penalty).
- The text does not define what form the kolasis takes.

### What Each Side Infers
- **ECT inference:** Since the same adjective (aionios) modifies both punishment and life, both must have the same duration. If life is unending, punishment is unending. This requires: (a) interpreting aionios as "unending in duration" uniformly (criterion #2 — choosing a reading); (b) inferring that the kolasis is conscious torment rather than the penalty of death (criterion #1 — adding a concept the text does not state).
- **Conditionalist inference:** The kolasis (punishment) is the "second death" — the penalty for sin is death (Rom 6:23), and the punishment is everlasting in its effect (permanent/irrevocable), not necessarily in its process. This requires: systematizing kolasis with thanatos vocabulary from other passages (criterion #5, #4a).

### Genre Note
This passage is parabolic — Jesus uses the imagery of a shepherd separating sheep and goats to teach about judgment. The subjects are human ("all nations"), but the literary form is parabolic/teaching discourse. The fire was "prepared for the devil and his angels" — its primary designation is for non-human entities, though humans are sent there.

## Passage 3: Daniel 12:2 — Everlasting Life and Everlasting Contempt

### What the Text Says
- "Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake" — death described as sleep in dust
- "Some to everlasting life" (chayyey olam)
- "Some to shame [and] everlasting contempt" (charaphah u-dera'on olam)
- The wise "shall shine as the brightness of the firmament" and "as the stars for ever and ever" (v.3)

### Vocabulary Analysis
- "sleep in the dust" — death as unconscious state in the earth (consistent with etc-03, etc-04 death-state studies)
- "everlasting life" (chayyey olam) — H2416 chay + H5769 olam *(olam examined in etc-07-hebrew-olam-ad.)*
- "shame" (charaphah, H2781) — disgrace, reproach
- "everlasting contempt" (dera'on olam) — H1860 dera'on, appearing only here and Isa 66:24 in all of Scripture. The word means "object of aversion/abhorrence."
- The text does not say "everlasting torment" or "everlasting suffering." It says "contempt/abhorrence" — a word that describes how the subjects are viewed, not what they experience.
- The parallel with Isa 66:24 (the only other use of dera'on) is notable: there the word describes the reaction of the living to "carcases" (peger — dead bodies).

### What Each Side Infers
- **ECT inference:** "Everlasting contempt" implies ongoing conscious experience of shame/disgrace. This requires adding the concept of consciousness to a word that describes how others view the subjects, not what the subjects experience.
- **Conditionalist inference:** "Everlasting contempt" means the subjects are objects of permanent aversion/repulsion. The only other use (Isa 66:24) applies the word to dead bodies (peger), suggesting the contempt is the lasting reputation of the destroyed, not their ongoing experience. This requires the SIS connection between Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24 (verified: shared rare vocabulary H1860).

## Passage 4: Isaiah 66:22-24 — Carcasses, Worm, and Fire

### What the Text Says
- Context: new heavens and new earth (v.22)
- All flesh comes to worship the LORD (v.23)
- "They shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me" (v.24)
- "For their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched" (v.24)
- "They shall be an abhorring unto all flesh" (v.24)

### Vocabulary Analysis
- "carcases" (peger, H6297) — This word means dead body/corpse. It appears 22 times in the OT and always refers to dead bodies, never living beings (Gen 15:11; Num 14:29,32; 1 Sam 17:46; Isa 14:19; 34:3; Nah 3:3).
- "worm shall not die" — Worms consume dead flesh. The imagery is of decomposition that is not interrupted (unquenchable decomposition of corpses).
- "fire...not quenched" — "Not quenched" (lo tikbeh) means not extinguished/not stopped before its work is complete (cf. Jer 17:27 — fire that "shall not be quenched" burned Jerusalem; the city is not still burning).
- "abhorring" (dera'on, H1860) — Same word as Dan 12:2 "contempt." Object of aversion.
- The subjects are "men that have transgressed" — but the text states the worshippers look upon their "carcases" (dead bodies). The transgressors are dead.
- "slain of the LORD shall be many" (v.16) — slain, not tormented
- "shall be consumed together" (v.17) — consumption vocabulary

### What Each Side Infers
- **ECT inference:** The "worm that dies not" and "fire not quenched" imagery represents eternal conscious torment. This requires: (a) ignoring peger (the subjects are dead bodies, not living beings); (b) treating decomposition imagery as torment imagery; (c) reading "not quenched" as "burning forever" rather than "not extinguished before completing its work."
- **Conditionalist inference:** The text describes the aftermath of divine judgment — dead bodies (peger) being consumed by worm and fire, observed by the living with abhorrence. The imagery is of completed destruction viewed as a permanent memorial/warning. The subjects are explicitly corpses.

### Critical Observation
The Hebrew peger is determinative for this passage. Worms and fire act upon corpses, not conscious beings. Jesus quotes this imagery in Mark 9:48, but Isa 66:24 itself describes dead bodies.

## Passage 5: John 5:28-29 — Resurrection of Life / Resurrection of Damnation

### What the Text Says
- "All that are in the graves shall hear his voice" (v.28)
- "And shall come forth" — a literal resurrection from death (v.29)
- "They that have done good, unto the resurrection of life" (anastasis zoes)
- "They that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation" (anastasis kriseos)

### Vocabulary Analysis
- "resurrection of life" (anastasis zoes) — resurrection leading to life
- "resurrection of damnation" — KJV translates krisis as "damnation," but the word is G2920 krisis = judgment/decision. The same word appears in v.22 ("all judgment"), v.24 ("condemnation"), v.27 ("execute judgment"), v.30 ("my judgment is just"). It is a judgment word, not a torment word.
- The text describes two outcomes of resurrection: life or judgment. It does not describe the nature of the judgment — whether it is torment, destruction, or something else.
- Context: v.24 states "He that heareth my word...hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation [krisis]; but is passed from death unto life." The opposite of life is death, and the opposite of escaping krisis is coming into krisis.
- v.26: "The Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself." Life as a divine attribute.

### What Each Side Infers
- **ECT inference:** The "resurrection of damnation" implies eternal conscious torment after resurrection. This requires adding torment to a text that says only "judgment" (krisis).
- **Conditionalist inference:** The "resurrection of judgment" leads to the execution of the penalty for sin (death — Rom 6:23). The passage contrasts life with judgment, and v.24 contrasts life with death. This requires systematizing John 5:29 with Rom 6:23 (criterion #5, #4a).

## Passage 6: 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10 — Everlasting Destruction

### What the Text Says
- "The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels" (v.7)
- "In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel" (v.8)
- "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power" (v.9)
- "When he shall come to be glorified in his saints" (v.10)

### Vocabulary Analysis
- "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion) — G3639 olethros = destruction/ruin (from ollymi, to destroy). The word appears 4 times in the NT (1 Cor 5:5; 1 Thess 5:3; 2 Thess 1:9; 1 Tim 6:9). In every occurrence it means destruction/ruin. *(Examined in etc-06-destruction-words.)*
- "from the presence of the Lord" (apo prosopou tou kuriou) — "away from the face of the Lord." The preposition apo = away from, separation from.
- "from the glory of his power" — separated from God's glorious power
- Paul's chosen word is olethros (destruction), not basanismos (torment), not kolasis (punishment), not timoria (penalty). He specifically chose a destruction word.
- "flaming fire taking vengeance" — fire as instrument of judgment
- Genre: Didactic epistle — Paul directly teaching a church about eschatological events

### What Each Side Infers
- **ECT inference:** "Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord" means eternal separation from God in a state of ongoing conscious ruin. "Destruction" is reinterpreted as a state of being destroyed but never actually perishing. This requires redefining olethros from its lexical meaning (ruin/destruction) to mean "ongoing existence in ruined state" (criterion #1 — adding a concept) and treating "from the presence of the Lord" as defining the nature of punishment rather than its source/origin (criterion #2 — choosing a reading).
- **Conditionalist inference:** "Everlasting destruction" is permanent destruction — they are destroyed and the destruction is irreversible (the result endures forever). "From the presence of the Lord" indicates the destruction comes from God's presence/power. This reads olethros at its lexical value and apo prosopou as indicating source.

## Passage 7: Hebrews 10:26-31 — Fearful Expectation of Judgment

### What the Text Says
- "If we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins" (v.26)
- "But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries" (v.27)
- "He that despised Moses' law died without mercy" (v.28)
- "Of how much sorer punishment [timoria], suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy" (v.29)
- "Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense" (v.30, quoting Deut 32:35)
- "The Lord shall judge his people" (v.30, quoting Deut 32:36)
- "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (v.31)
- "We are not of them who draw back unto perdition [apoleia]; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul" (v.39)

### Vocabulary Analysis
- "fiery indignation, which shall devour" (v.27) — "devour" (esthio/katesthio) is consumption/destruction vocabulary. Fire that devours consumes what it burns.
- "sorer punishment" (timoria, G5098) — 1 NT occurrence. The only use of this noun form. Emphasizes retributive penalty/vindication.
- "died without mercy" (v.28) — The paradigm of punishment under Moses' law was death. The author uses this as the lesser penalty, then argues the penalty for rejecting Christ's sacrifice is "sorer."
- "perdition" (apoleia, G684) — destruction/ruin (from apollymi). The author contrasts "perdition" (destruction) with "saving of the soul" (v.39). The binary is destruction vs. salvation, not torment vs. salvation.
- The passage's own comparisons: (a) fire that "devours" adversaries; (b) death as paradigm from Mosaic law; (c) perdition vs. saving the soul. All three use destruction/death vocabulary.
- "Vengeance" and "judge" — from Deut 32:35-36, God's response to covenant breaking

### What Each Side Infers
- **ECT inference:** "Sorer punishment" than death implies something worse than death, which is eternal conscious torment. This requires interpreting "sorer" as "more prolonged" rather than "more severe" or "more complete," and overriding the passage's own destruction vocabulary (devour, perdition, death paradigm).
- **Conditionalist inference:** "Sorer punishment" than physical death under the Mosaic law is the second death — permanent, total destruction of soul and body (Matt 10:28). The passage's vocabulary consistently uses destruction terminology: fire devours, the alternative to salvation is perdition (apoleia). This systematizes the passage's own terms.

## Passage 8: Romans 2:5-11 — Wrath, Indignation, Tribulation, Anguish

### What the Text Says
- "Treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God" (v.5)
- "Who will render to every man according to his deeds" (v.6)
- "To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life" (v.7)
- "But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath" (v.8)
- "Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil" (v.9)
- "But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good" (v.10)
- "For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law" (v.12)

### Vocabulary Analysis
- "seek for...immortality" (aphtharsia, G861) — Immortality is something humans must seek, not something they inherently possess. The righteous are given immortality as a gift with eternal life. *(Examined in etc-02-who-has-immortality.)*
- "eternal life" (zoe aionios) — given to seekers of immortality
- "indignation and wrath" (thumos kai orge) — These are divine emotional responses, not descriptions of what the wicked experience eternally. They describe God's attitude in judgment.
- "tribulation and anguish" (thlipsis kai stenochoria) — These terms describe the experience of judgment. The text states these come "upon every soul of man that doeth evil." The passage does not specify the duration or nature beyond the experience of the judgment process.
- "perish" (apollymi, G622) — v.12 uses destruction vocabulary for the final outcome: "sinned without law shall also perish without law." This is the same word used throughout the NT for destruction/loss of life.
- The structure contrasts: seekers of immortality → eternal life; disobedient → wrath, then perish
- Genre: Didactic epistle — Paul directly teaching about God's judgment principles

### What Each Side Infers
- **ECT inference:** "Tribulation and anguish" on every evil soul implies eternal conscious torment. The wrath and indignation continue forever. This requires: extending "tribulation and anguish" (which the text uses for the judgment experience) into an eternal state (criterion #1 — adding duration the text does not specify).
- **Conditionalist inference:** The passage's structure shows the righteous seek and receive immortality + eternal life, while the wicked face wrath and "perish" (v.12). If the wicked had inherent immortality, seeking immortality would be unnecessary. The final outcome stated in v.12 is that they "perish." This reads the passage's own concluding vocabulary (apollymi).
