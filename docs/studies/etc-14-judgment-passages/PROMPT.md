| etc-06 | Destruction/perishing vocabulary | Covers apollumi, olethros vocabulary in some of these passages |
| etc-07 | Hebrew olam/ad | Covers Dan 12:2 olam usage |
| etc-08 | Greek aionios/aion | Covers Matt 25:46 aionios usage |
| etc-10 | Ecclesiastes/Psalms death consciousness | Background on death state |
| etc-11 | Revelation torment passages | Covers Rev 14:10-11 |
| etc-12 | Devil, beast, false prophet | Covers Rev 20:10 torment formula |
| etc-13 | Lake of fire / second death | Covers Rev 20:14-15 identification |

Key prior findings:
- etc-13: Lake of fire IS "second death" (thanatos vocabulary, not basanizo). Torment formula applied to non-human/symbolic entities. Humans at the lake = "second death."
- etc-12: Rev 20:10 torment formula subjects are devil, beast, false prophet (non-human/symbolic). Gate 1 and Gate 3 failures.
- etc-08: aionios in Matt 25:46 modifies both "punishment" and "life." The adjective is the same; what it modifies differs. kolasis = 2 NT uses (Matt 25:46, 1 John 4:18).
- etc-06: olethros (destruction) in 2 Thess 1:9. apollumi/apolia destruction vocabulary study.
- etc-07: Dan 12:2 olam in "everlasting life" and "everlasting contempt." Hebrew olam duration study.
