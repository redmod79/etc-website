# PROMPT.md — etc5-14: Major Biblical Judgment Passages
## Series: ETC5 — The Final Fate of the Wicked (Study 14 of 18)
## Phase: Scoping — Completed

---

## Central Question

**"What do the major biblical judgment passages say about the final fate of the wicked? Survey the key judgment texts across both testaments. What language do they use? Do they consistently describe ongoing conscious torment, destruction/cessation, or both? Focus on passages not yet deeply covered in prior studies: Revelation 20:11-15 (Great White Throne), Matthew 25:31-46 (Sheep and Goats in-depth), Daniel 12:2 (everlasting contempt), Isaiah 66:22-24 (new creation context + corpses), John 5:28-29 (resurrection to condemnation), 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10 (destruction from presence of Lord), Hebrews 10:26-31 (fearful judgment), Hebrews 6:1-2 (eternal judgment), Romans 2:5-11 (wrath, indignation, tribulation, anguish), and Acts 24:15 (resurrection of just and unjust)."**

## Series Context

**Prior studies concluded (etc5-01 through etc5-13):**
- etc5-01: Nature of man (nephesh, dust returns) — E001-E060
- etc5-02: Immortality — God alone has it; mortals must acquire it at resurrection
- etc5-03: Biblical death — death = cessation, not alternative consciousness
- etc5-04: State of the dead — Sheol/Hades = unconscious waiting state
- etc5-05: Four hell words — Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, Tartarus distinguished
- etc5-06: Destruction vocabulary — apollumi/abad semantic field; LXX bridge
- etc5-07: Olam/forever in OT — contextually-bounded duration
- etc5-08: Aionios in NT — age-related adjective; not inherently endless
- etc5-09: Rich Man and Lazarus — pre-judgment Hades setting; parabolic genre
- etc5-10: Souls under the altar — martyrs in Hades; juridical-cry formula
- etc5-11: Smoke ascending forever — literary formula from Isa 34:10
- etc5-12: Tormented forever — specific subjects (devil/beast/false prophet)
- etc5-13: Lake of fire / second death — Death and Hades abolished; second death = thanatos

**Master evidence state entering etc5-14:** 351 items (E001-E267, N001-N042, IA001-IA022, IB001-IB015, IC001-IC002, ID001-ID003)

## Greek Parsing Data

### John 5:29 — N1904 Greek Text
**καὶ ἐκπορεύσονται οἱ τὰ ἀγαθὰ ποιήσαντες εἰς ἀνάστασιν ζωῆς, οἱ τὰ φαῦλα πράξαντες εἰς ἀνάστασιν κρίσεως.**

Key words:
- ἐκπορεύσονται (G1607, V-FDI-3P) = "shall come forth" — Fut Mid Ind 3rd Pl
- ἀνάστασιν (G386, N-ASF) = "resurrection" — Acc Sg F (appears TWICE)
- ζωῆς (G2222, N-GSF) = "of life" — genitive attribute
- φαῦλα (G5337, A-APN) = "evil/vile things" — Acc Pl N (not kakos = morally evil but phaulos = of base quality)
- κρίσεως (G2920, N-GSF) = "of judgment/condemnation" — genitive attribute

**Key finding:** The word for the negative resurrection is kriseōs (G2920 krisis = judgment/condemnation), NOT basanismou (G929 = torment). The resurrection of the wicked is named after the judicial verdict, not after the experience of torment.

### 2 Thessalonians 1:9 — N1904 Greek Text
**οἵτινες δίκην τίσουσιν ὄλεθρον αἰώνιον ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δόξης τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ,**

Key words:
- δίκην (G1349, N-ASF) = "justice/penalty" — Acc Sg F (diken = a judicial penalty)
- τίσουσιν (G5099, V-FAI-3P) = "shall pay/suffer" — Fut Act Ind 3rd Pl
- ὄλεθρον (G3639, N-ASM) = "destruction" — Acc Sg M (the DIRECT OBJECT of suffer)
- αἰώνιον (G166, A-ASM) = "everlasting/age-long" — Acc Sg M (modifies ὄλεθρον)
- ἀπὸ προσώπου (G575 + G4383) = "from [the] face/presence"

**Key finding:** The punishment noun is ὄλεθρον (olethron = destruction/ruin), NOT basanismon (torment). The "everlasting" adjective (aionion) modifies the destruction noun. The event occurs at the Lord's appearance (parousia context, v.7-10).

### Hebrews 10:27 — N1904 Greek Text
**φοβερὰ δέ τις ἐκδοχὴ κρίσεως καὶ πυρὸς ζῆλος ἐσθίειν μέλλοντος τοὺς ὑπεναντίους.**

Key words:
- φοβερὰ (G5398, A-NSF) = "fearful/terrifying" — Nom Sg F
- ἐκδοχὴ (G1561, N-NSF) = "expectation/looking for" — Nom Sg F
- κρίσεως (G2920, N-GSF) = "of judgment" — Gen Sg F (genitive: expectation OF judgment)
- ζῆλος (G2205, N-NSN) = "zeal/indignation/fury"
- ἐσθίειν (G2068, V-PAN) = "to eat/devour" — Pres Act Inf (the consuming action)
- ὑπεναντίους (G5227, A-APM) = "adversaries/opponents"

**Key finding:** The fire is described by its consuming/devouring action (esthiein = to eat/devour) against adversaries — consumption vocabulary, not basanizō (torment) vocabulary.

### Romans 2:8 — N1904 Greek Text
**τοῖς δὲ ἐξ ἐριθείας καὶ ἀπειθοῦσι τῇ ἀληθείᾳ πειθομένοις δὲ τῇ ἀδικίᾳ, ὀργὴ καὶ θυμός.**

Key words:
- ἐριθείας (G2052, N-GSF) = "self-interest/strife"
- ἀπειθοῦσι (G544, V-PAP-DPM) = "disobeying" — Pres Act Ptcp Dat Pl M
- ὀργὴ (G3709, N-NSF) = "wrath" — Nom Sg F (NOMINATIVE = the result coming upon them)
- θυμός (G2372, N-NSM) = "indignation/wrath" — Nom Sg M (NOMINATIVE = paired result)

**Key finding:** orge and thumos are NOMINATIVE = they are what comes upon the disobedient. Then v.9 continues: "tribulation [thlipsis] and anguish [stenochoria] upon every soul of man that doeth evil." These are judgment-day vocabulary, not explicit eternal duration statements.

### Revelation 20:12 — N1904 Greek Text
**καὶ εἶδον τοὺς νεκρούς... ἑστῶτας ἐνώπιον τοῦ θρόνου, καὶ βιβλία ἠνοίχθησαν· καὶ ἄλλο βιβλίον ἠνοίχθη, ὅ ἐστιν τῆς ζωῆς· καὶ ἐκρίθησαν οἱ νεκροὶ ἐκ τῶν γεγραμμένων ἐν τοῖς βιβλίοις κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν.**

Key words:
- ἑστῶτας (G2476, V-RAP-APM) = "standing" — Perf Act Ptcp Acc Pl M
- ἠνοίχθησαν (G455, V-API-3P) = "were opened" — Aor Pass Ind Pl 3rd (books)
- ἐκρίθησαν (G2919, V-API-3P) = "were judged" — Aor Pass Ind Pl 3rd
- κατὰ τὰ ἔργα (kata ta erga) = "according to their works"

**Key finding:** The standard of judgment is works (erga). No torment vocabulary appears in this judgment description. The judgment is judicial (krino), not torture-based (basanizō).

## Analysis Focus Areas for Phase 3

1. **Rev 20:11-15** — Great White Throne: judgment according to works; Death/Hades abolished; not-in-book-of-life cast in. No torment formula applied here.
2. **Jn 5:28-29** — The critical lexical observation: kriseōs (G2920 = judgment) NOT basanismou (G929 = torment). The resurrection of the wicked is named after the verdict, not the suffering.
3. **Dan 12:2** — Dir'on (H1860) = contempt/abhorrence — the same word as Isa 66:24 "abhorring." The everlasting contempt refers to how the judged are regarded, not necessarily to ongoing subjective torment.
4. **Isa 66:22-24** — New creation context: v.22 (new heavens/earth), v.23 (all flesh worship), v.24 (carcases/pigrê). The fire and worm act on corpses in the new creation setting.
5. **2 Th 1:7-10** — Parousia event context: destruction occurs WHEN the Lord appears; the apo prosōpou ("from the presence") is the agent/source of destruction, not a description of ongoing separation.
6. **Heb 10:26-31** — Fiery indignation that devours (esthiein = to eat/consume) adversaries. The consuming fire vocabulary continues the destruction theme.
7. **Heb 6:1-2** — "Eternal judgment" (krima aionion) as foundational doctrine — what does this mean? The aionion adjective modifies the judgment event, not a duration of torment.
8. **Rom 2:5-11** — Wrath, indignation, tribulation, anguish — descriptors of the judgment process at the "day of wrath." They describe the experience at judgment, not necessarily its duration.
9. **Acts 24:15** — Resurrection of just AND unjust — Paul affirms both resurrections to Felix. The resurrection of the unjust leads to judgment.
10. **ECT vs. Conditionalist reading survey** — For each passage: what the text says, what ECT infers, what conditionalism infers.
