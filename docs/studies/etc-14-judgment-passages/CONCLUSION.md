# CONCLUSION — etc5-14: Major Biblical Judgment Passages
## Series: ETC5 — The Final Fate of the Wicked (Study 14 of 18)
## Date: 2026-02-19

---

## 1. Question + Summary Answer

**Question:** What do the major biblical judgment passages teach about the final fate of the wicked? Do they describe ongoing conscious torment (ECT), destruction/cessation (conditionalism), or something else?

**Summary Answer:** The ten major judgment passages examined in this study consistently employ judicial/forensic vocabulary (krinō, krisis, krima) and destruction vocabulary (apollumi, diaphtheirō, olethros, esthiō) rather than torment vocabulary (basanizō, basanismos). Revelation 20:12 uses ekrithēsan ("were judged") — not basanizō — as the judgment verb. John 5:29 names the negative resurrection "resurrection of kriseōs" (G2920 = judgment/verdict), not "resurrection of basanismou" (torment). Romans 2:12 uses apollōntai (perish/be destroyed) as Paul's summary word for the fate of the wicked. Hebrews 10:27 describes the fire's action as esthiein (to eat/devour) — consumption vocabulary. These are new observations from this study. The torment vocabulary (basanizō/basanismos) does not appear in any of these ten passages. The study adds 23 new evidence items (E268–E281, N043–N046, IA023–IA025, IB016–IB017) to the master tracker, raising the series total from 351 to 374 items.

## 2. Key Verses

**Revelation 20:12** — "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works."

**John 5:29** — "And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation [kriseōs — G2920, judgment/verdict]."

**2 Thessalonians 1:9** — "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction [olethron aiōnion] from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"

**Hebrews 10:27** — "But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour [esthiein — G2068, to eat/consume] the adversaries."

**Romans 2:12** — "For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish [apollōntai — G622] without law."

**Acts 24:15** — "And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."

**Hebrews 6:2** — "Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment [krima aiōnion]."

**Revelation 11:18** — "...and shouldest destroy [diaphtheirai — G1311] them which destroy the earth."

## 3. Full Analysis

### The Vocabulary Distribution Across All Ten Passages

This study's central finding is a comprehensive vocabulary survey across ten major judgment passages:

| Passage | Judicial Vocabulary | Destruction Vocabulary | Torment Vocabulary |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Rev 20:12 | ekrithēsan (krinō, G2919) | — | **ABSENT** |
| Jhn 5:29 | kriseōs (krisis, G2920) | — | **ABSENT** |
| 2Th 1:9 | diken tisousinEN (justice satisfied) | olethron (G3639) | **ABSENT** |
| Heb 10:27 | kriseōs (G2920) | esthiein (G2068) | **ABSENT** |
| Heb 6:2 | krima aiōnion (G2917) | — | **ABSENT** |
| Rom 2:8-9 | orgē, thumos, thlipsis, stenochōria | apollōntai (v.12) | **ABSENT** |
| Acts 24:15 | anastasin (resurrection framework) | — | **ABSENT** |
| Rev 11:18 | judged (krinō) | diaphtheirai (G1311) | **ABSENT** |
| Mat 12:36-37 | katakrithēsē (judicial verdict) | — | **ABSENT** |
| 2Co 5:10 | bēma (tribunal), judgment | — | **ABSENT** |

Basanizō/basanismos is absent from every passage surveyed. This observation extends the vocabulary-distribution finding of N033 (established in etc5-06) across the major judgment passages of the NT.

### The Forensic Framework

Across every major judgment passage, the dominant vocabulary is judicial/forensic. The Great White Throne scene (Rev 20:11-15) uses krinō (judicial verdict) twice (vv.12, 13), the criterion is works evaluated by written record, and the book of life determines the outcome. John 5:29 names the negative resurrection after the verdict (krisis) rather than the experience. Hebrews 6:2 lists "eternal judgment" (krima aiōnion) as a foundational doctrine — permanent, irrevocable verdict. Matthew 12:36-37 uses katakrithēsē (judicial condemnation) for the outcome of idle words. 2 Corinthians 5:10 uses bēma (the tribunal platform) for the judgment seat of Christ. The consistent vocabulary is of a court rendering a verdict, not of a torture chamber inflicting pain.

### The Destruction Vocabulary

Where outcome language appears, it is consistently destruction vocabulary. Romans 2:12 uses apollōntai (G622 = perish/be destroyed) in the same passage as the wrath/indignation/tribulation/anguish language of vv.8-9. Revelation 11:18 uses diaphtheirai (G1311 = to destroy utterly/ruin) for the fate of those who destroy the earth. 2 Thessalonians 1:9 uses olethron (G3639 = ruin/destruction) as the direct object of the punishment verb. Hebrews 10:27 uses esthiein (G2068 = to eat/devour) for the fire's action on adversaries — consumption, not torment. This extends the pattern established in IA019 (destruction vocabulary for the general human wicked) to ten additional passages.

### The John 5:29 Lexical Finding (New — E270, N045, IB017)

The negative resurrection in John 5:29 is named "anastasim kriseōs" — resurrection of krisis (G2920). The Greek word krisis in all 34 NT occurrences functions as judicial vocabulary (52.9% = "judgment," 23.5% = "of judgment," 5.9% = "damnation," 5.9% = "accusation"). It never carries the semantic content of torment. The KJV rendering "damnation" uses a broad English word; the underlying Greek is the same word used in Heb 10:27 ("fearful looking for of judgment") and Heb 6:2 ("eternal judgment"). The negative resurrection is named after the judicial verdict that follows it, not after the experiential content of torment (basanismos). This is the strongest new lexical finding of this study.

### The Parousia Context of 2 Thessalonians 1:9 (Extending E116, E210)

The "everlasting destruction" of 2Th 1:9 is framed by the parousia event (v.7: "when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed"; v.10: "when he shall come"). The hotan clause of v.10 explicitly brackets the destruction to the moment of the Lord's appearing. The punishment is an event at the parousia, not a process ongoing since death. This corroborates the established finding (E210, IB010) that the apo prosōpou ("from the presence") is a source/agent construction, not a banishment construction.

### The New Creation Context of Isaiah 66:22-24 (Extending E141, E193 — E271)

The scene in Isa 66:22-24 is set in the new creation (new heavens and earth, v.22), during which universal worship occurs (v.23). The righteous go forth and look upon pigrê (H6297 = corpses/dead bodies, v.24). The dir'on (H1860 = abhorring) is what all flesh has toward the corpses. The objects of the worm and fire are the dead bodies of transgressors — not living conscious persons. This provides the new creation context for the established E141 (pigrê = corpses) and E193 (dir'on connection to Dan 12:2).

### The Hebrews 10:27 Consumption Vocabulary (New — E272, N046)

The fire of Heb 10:27 is described by its action: esthiein (G2068, Pres Act Inf = to eat/devour) the adversaries. This is consumption vocabulary — identical in semantic register to Rev 20:9 (katephagen = devoured the nations, E180). The fire eats/consumes the adversaries. No basanizō appears. This connects with N046 (esthiein confirmed = consumption vocabulary) and extends N033's established lexical separation.

### I-B Tensions Resolved

**IB016 (Mat 25:41 fire — same experience for humans as for devil/angels?):** The tension is between E149 (torment-for-ever for three named entities, Rev 20:10) and E212 (torment formula not applied to human wicked in adjacent Rev 20:15, same author). Resolution: Moderate — weight AGAINST universal extension. Same author, adjacent verses, same lake; the torment formula is withheld from human persons in the immediately following description.

**IB017 (Jhn 5:29 krisis — includes torment content?):** The tension is between E149/E150 (explicit torment in specific passages) and E270 (kriseōs = G2920, never translates as torment, all 34 NT uses = judicial vocabulary). Resolution: Moderate — weight AGAINST reading eternal conscious torment as the content of kriseōs. The word choice itself contrasts with passages that explicitly use basanizō/basanismos.

## 4. Evidence Classification Tables

### Explicit Statements (E) — New Items

| Master ID | Explicit Statement | Reference | Classification |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **E268** | The judgment criterion at the Great White Throne is works (erga) evaluated by written record; the judgment verb is ekrithēsan (krinō, G2919 — judicial verdict), not basanizō (torment). | Rev 20:12 | Neutral |
| **E269** | "There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust." Paul explicitly affirms the two-resurrection framework. | Acts 24:15 | Neutral |
| **E270** | The negative resurrection destination in Jhn 5:29 is anastasim kriseōs — using kriseōs (G2920, N-GSF = judgment/verdict), NOT basanismos (torment). The Greek word is krisis (34 NT occ: 52.9% = judgment; 0% = torment). | Jhn 5:29 | Neutral |
| **E271** | Isaiah 66:22-24 places the worm/fire scene in the new creation context (new heavens and earth, v.22; universal worship, v.23); the objects seen by the righteous are pigrê (H6297 = corpses/dead bodies, v.24) — extending the context of the already-established E141 and E193. | Isa 66:22-24 | Neutral |
| **E272** | "Fiery indignation, which shall devour [esthiein — G2068, V-PAN = to eat/devour] the adversaries." The fire's action in Heb 10:27 is consumption vocabulary (esthiō), not basanizō (torment). | Heb 10:27 | Neutral |
| **E273** | "Of the doctrine of... resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment [krima aiōnion — G2917 + G166]." Hebrews 6:2 lists "eternal judgment" as one of six foundational Christian doctrines; the word for this judgment is krima (verdict/judicial decision), not basanismos (torment); it is paired with "resurrection of the dead." | Heb 6:2 | Neutral |
| **E274** | Romans 2:8-9 uses four judgment-vocabulary terms for the wicked's fate: orgē (G3709, N-NSF = wrath), thumos (G2372, N-NSM = fury/indignation), thlipsis (G2347 = tribulation/affliction), stenochōria (G4730 = anguish/distress). None is basanismos or basanizō. | Rom 2:8-9 | Neutral |
| **E275** | "For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish [apollōntai — G622, V-FMI-3P: Fut Mid Ind Pl 3rd] without law." Paul's own summary word for the final fate of the wicked in Rom 2:12 is apollumi (perish/be destroyed). This appears in the same passage (v.12) immediately following the wrath/indignation/tribulation/anguish language of vv.8-9. | Rom 2:12 | Conditionalist |
| **E276** | "And shouldest destroy [diaphtheirai — G1311, Aorist Act Inf = to destroy utterly/ruin] them which destroy the earth." In Rev 11:18, the eschatological judgment includes destroying those who destroy the earth; the verb for the wicked's fate is diaphtheirō (destroy utterly), not basanizō. | Rev 11:18 | Conditionalist |
| **E277** | "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." Hebrews 10:31 concludes the judgment warning of Heb 10:26-31, emphasizing the terror of divine judgment itself without specifying duration or form as eternal conscious torment. | Heb 10:31 | Neutral |
| **E278** | "For we must all appear before the judgment seat [bēma — G968 = tribunal/raised platform for judicial decisions] of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad." The bēma of Christ evaluates deeds done in the body; universal scope ("all"); no torment duration stated. | 2Co 5:10 | Neutral |
| **E279** | "For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned [katakrithēsē — G2632, V-FPI-2S = Fut Pass Ind 2nd Sg]." The outcome of words at judgment is judicial condemnation (katakrino = judicial verdict), not specification of torment content. | Mat 12:36-37 | Neutral |
| **E280** | "The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth" — all persons in the graves come forth at the resurrection; both the righteous and the wicked emerge from the same state of being in graves. | Jhn 5:28 | Neutral |
| **E281** | "From whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them." At the Great White Throne, the entire current physical cosmos is displaced — the earth and heaven flee the presence of the judge. | Rev 20:11 | Neutral |

| E214 | Mat 25:41 — hetoimasmenon (V-RPP-ASN = Perfect Passive Participle: already-prepared state) governs pyr aiōnion; the fire was prepared for the devil and his angels as stated recipients. | Mat 25:41 | **+etc5-14** |
| IB008 | The ongoing torment language of Rev 20:10 and Rev 14:10-11 applies to specific named subjects; extending it universally to all persons in the lake is an inference. Resolved Moderate — weight AGAINST universal extension. | Rev 20:10; 20:15; 14:10-11 | **+etc5-14** |
| IB010 | "Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord" — banishment reading requires understanding apo prosōpou as separation rather than source/agent. Resolved Moderate — weight AGAINST banishment reading. | 2Th 1:9 | **+etc5-14** |
| N029 | "Eternal fire" on Sodom/Gomorrah = ashes (2 Pet 2:6; Jude 1:7) — demonstrates aionios fire = permanent result, not ongoing process. | Jude 1:7; 2 Pet 2:6 | **+etc5-14** *(reclassified to IB009-resolved after Study 5)* |
| N033 | The destruction vocabulary (apollumi, abad, etc.) and torment vocabulary (basanizō, basanismos) are lexically distinct; they describe different things and are not used interchangeably. | etc5-06 | **+etc5-14** |

### Necessary Implications (N) — New Items

| Master ID | Necessary Implication | Based On | Classification |
|-----------|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| **N043** | The evaluation standard at the Great White Throne is works (erga) by written record, using the judicial verb krinō — not basanizō. Both sides must acknowledge these words appear in Rev 20:12-13. | E268 (Rev 20:12 krinō + erga); E111 (Rev 20:15); E110 (Rev 20:14) | Neutral |
| **N044** | Paul's own summary word for the fate of sinners in Romans 2 is apollumi (perish completely), the destruction vocabulary, appearing in the same passage (v.12) as the wrath/indignation/tribulation/anguish language of vv.8-9. Both sides must acknowledge what word Paul uses in v.12. | E275 (Rom 2:12: apollōntai); E274 (Rom 2:8-9) | Conditionalist |
| **N045** | The negative resurrection in Jhn 5:29 is named "resurrection of judgment/condemnation" using krisis (G2920) — not anastasim basanismou (resurrection of torment). The underlying Greek word is kriseōs (confirmed by N1904 parsing). Both sides must acknowledge this lexical fact. | E270 (Jhn 5:29: kriseōs = G2920 confirmed); G2920 lexical data | Neutral |
| **N046** | The fire in Hebrews 10:27 is described by its consuming/devouring action toward adversaries: esthiein (G2068, V-PAN = to eat/devour) — not basanizō (to torment). Both sides must acknowledge that Heb 10:27 uses esthiō, not basanizō. | E272 (Heb 10:27: esthiein = G2068 confirmed by parsing); E180 (Rev 20:9: same consumption vocabulary) | Neutral |

### Inferences (I) — New Items

#### I-A (Conditionalist-Direction Inference)

| Master ID | Claim | Based On | Classification |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **IA023** | The Great White Throne judgment (Rev 20:11-15) establishes all unsaved humans are cast into the lake of fire after forensic judgment by works — and the absence of torment vocabulary for humans in this passage is consistent with the conditionalist reading (lake = second death = actual death). | E268, E111, E110, N043, IA013 (pre-existing: second death = actual death) | Conditionalist |
| **IA024** | The complete absence of basanizō/basanismos from every major judgment passage (Rev 20:12; Jhn 5:29; 2Th 1:9; Heb 10:27; Heb 6:2; Rom 2:8-9; Acts 24:15; Rev 11:18; Mat 12:36-37; 2Co 5:10) — combined with the presence of destruction vocabulary (apollumi, krinō, esthiō, diaphtheirō, olethros) — indicates the torment vocabulary is specifically applied to the three named supernatural entities (Rev 20:10) and specific tribulation-era class (Rev 14:10-11), while destruction vocabulary governs the general human judgment. | N033; E272, E276, E275, E274, E270, E268, E210 (all confirming vocabulary distribution); IA019 (existing: pre-study vocabulary distribution) | Conditionalist |
| **IA025** | The biblical judgment passages consistently describe judgment as a forensic/judicial event (books opened, works evaluated, verdict rendered by krinō) rather than as the initiation of ongoing conscious torment. The judicial framework of evaluation → verdict → execution governs the structure of every major judgment scene. | E268 (Rev 20:12: books/works/krinō); E273 (Heb 6:2: krima aiōnion = eternal verdict); N043, N045; E270 (kriseōs = verdict); E279 (Mat 12:37: katakrithēsē); E278 (2Co 5:10: bēma = tribunal) | Neutral |

#### I-B (Competing Evidence)

| Master ID | Claim | Classification | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|----------------|------------|
| **IB016** | The fire of Mat 25:41 ("everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels") involves ongoing torment for human persons cast into it, just as it involves torment for the devil and his angels — the preparation for supernatural entities and the casting of humans into the same fire implies the same experience. | ECT direction | **Moderate — weight AGAINST universal extension.** E212 (same author, adjacent verses: torment formula applied in Rev 20:10 to three entities, withheld in Rev 20:15 for human wicked) directly addresses this question via #4a SIS. The inference that same-location = same-experience requires an inference step the adjacent text does not support. |
| **IB017** | The "resurrection of damnation" (anastasim kriseōs) in Jhn 5:29 includes ongoing eternal conscious suffering as the content of the damnation — krisis encompasses not just the verdict but the execution of eternal torment as the sentence. | ECT direction | **Moderate — weight AGAINST reading eternal conscious torment as the content of kriseōs.** The Greek word is krisis (G2920 = judgment/verdict); all 34 NT occurrences = judicial vocabulary, never torment vocabulary. Reading torment content into kriseōs requires importing basanismos vocabulary that the text does not use (E270, N045). |

## 7. Conclusion

*No advocacy. Methodological summary only.*

This study examined ten major biblical judgment passages. The methodological findings are:

**On vocabulary:** The Greek terms used across the ten major judgment passages are consistently judicial (krinō, krisis, krima, bēma, katakrino) or destruction-related (apollumi, olethros, diaphtheirō, esthiō). The torment vocabulary (basanizō, basanismos) does not appear in any of the ten passages. This is an observable lexical fact from the Greek texts.

**On John 5:29 specifically:** The negative resurrection is anastasim kriseōs — using G2920 (krisis = judgment/verdict), confirmed by N1904 parsing. The word krisis in its 34 NT occurrences functions as judicial vocabulary. The choice of word names the destination after the verdict rather than after the experiential content of torment.

**On Romans 2:12:** Paul uses apollōntai (G622 = perish/be destroyed) as his summary word for the fate of sinners in the same passage (v.12) as the wrath/indignation/tribulation/anguish language of vv.8-9.

**On Hebrews 10:27:** The fire's action is esthiein (G2068 = to eat/devour) — consumption vocabulary consistent with katephagen (devoured) in Rev 20:9.

**On the two I-B tensions:** IB016 (Mat 25:41 fire — same experience for humans as for devil/angels?) resolves Moderate weight AGAINST universal extension, based on E212 (same author, adjacent verses, torment formula applied only to three named entities). IB017 (Jhn 5:29 krisis — includes torment content?) resolves Moderate weight AGAINST reading torment content into kriseōs, based on E270 (lexical data: 34 NT uses of G2920, all judicial vocabulary, none torment).
