# Judgment Passages — E/N/I Classification (Rev 20:11-15, Matt 25:31-46, Dan 12:2, Isa 66:22-24, John 5:28-29, 2 Thess 1:7-10, Heb 10:26-31, Rom 2:5-11)

## Question
Major passages: Rev 20:11-15, Matt 25:31-46, Dan 12:2, Isa 66:22-24, John 5:28-29, 2 Thess 1:7-10, Heb 10:26-31, Rom 2:5-11. Each analyzed for E/N/I tier.

## Summary Answer
Across 8 major judgment passages, the vocabulary used for the fate of the wicked falls into three categories: (1) destruction/death vocabulary — Rev 20:11-15 ("second death"), 2 Thess 1:9 (olethros — destruction), Heb 10:26-31 (devour, perdition/apoleia), Rom 2:5-12 (perish/apollymi); (2) penalty/judgment vocabulary without specifying nature — Matt 25:46 (kolasis — punishment), John 5:29 (krisis — judgment); (3) contempt/corpse vocabulary describing the viewed state of the dead — Dan 12:2 (dera'on — contempt/abhorrence), Isa 66:24 (peger — carcasses, dera'on — abhorring). None of the 8 passages use basanizo (torment) for the fate of human wicked. Four use explicit destruction/death terms. The remaining four use either general penalty vocabulary or describe the dead as objects of abhorrence. Rom 2:7 treats immortality as something seekers receive with eternal life, not an inherent human attribute.

## Key Verses
- **Rev 20:11-15** — Great White Throne judgment; humans cast into lake of fire = "second death" (thanatos)
- **Matt 25:46** — "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion) vs. "life eternal" (zoen aionion)
- **Dan 12:2** — "everlasting life" (chayyey olam) and "shame and everlasting contempt" (dera'on olam)
- **Isa 66:24** — "carcases" (peger — dead bodies) with worm and fire; "abhorring" (dera'on)
- **John 5:29** — "resurrection of life" and "resurrection of damnation" (krisis — judgment)
- **2 Thess 1:9** — "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion) from the Lord's presence
- **Heb 10:27,29,39** — Fire "devours"; "sorer punishment" (timoria); "perdition" (apoleia) vs. "saving of the soul"
- **Rom 2:7-9,12** — Seek immortality → eternal life; disobedient → wrath → "perish" (apollymi)

## Evidence Classification

*Evidence items tracked in etc-master-evidence.md*

### INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY
- This study examines 8 major judgment passages for what the text says versus what each side infers. Focus is on the actual vocabulary each passage uses for the fate of the wicked.
- Evidence is gathered from all sides. The role is investigator, not advocate.
- Statements below report what the text says and what the lexical/distribution data shows. Interpretive inferences are classified separately.
- Many items from these passages were already registered in prior studies (etc-02 through etc-13). Existing master IDs are cited. New items are added with IDs continuing from E403, N058, I062.

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The 8 major judgment passages collectively use destruction/death vocabulary (thanatos, olethros, katesthio, apoleia, apollymi) for the fate of the human wicked, while none uses basanizo (torment) for humans | E30/E418 (no basanizo in any passage), E31/E419 (4 passages use destruction vocabulary), E19/E090 (olethros), E22/E252 (devour), E25/E414 (apoleia), E29/E417 (apollymi), E5/E394 (thanatos) | Neutral | Both sides can verify which Greek words appear in these 8 passages. The word count is observable. | N059 *NEW* |
| N2 | In Isa 66:24, the subjects of the worm and fire are peger (dead bodies), which connects to Dan 12:2 "everlasting contempt" through the shared rare word dera'on (H1860, 2 OT occurrences) — both passages describe how the dead are viewed by the living | E13/E192 (peger = dead bodies), E12/E267 (dera'on only in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24), E14/E406 (subjects of worm/fire are peger) | Neutral | The shared vocabulary (dera'on) linking these two passages is a verifiable fact. That both describe how the living view the dead is observable from the text: Isa 66:24 = onlookers look upon carcasses; Dan 12:2 = the contempt is what is everlasting about the wicked (not stated that the wicked experience it). | N060 *NEW* |
| N3 | Rom 2:7 states immortality must be sought — it is received with eternal life, not inherently possessed. The same passage states disobedient sinners "perish" (apollymi, v.12). | E27/E025 (seek immortality → eternal life), E29/E417 (sinners perish) | Neutral | Both sides accept that the text says immortality is sought. Both accept that v.12 says sinners perish. These are what the passage states. | N061 *NEW* |

**N-tier verification (3-question test):**

- **N1/N059:** (1) Both sides can count which Greek words appear in these passages. YES. (2) One meaning: word presence is observable fact. YES. (3) Zero added concepts. YES. PASSES.

- **N2/N060:** (1) Both sides accept dera'on appears only in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24. Both accept peger = dead bodies. YES. (2) Observable shared vocabulary. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N3/N061:** (1) Both sides accept the text says "seek for...immortality" and "shall also perish." YES. (2) One meaning: the text states these things. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|----------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | The "everlasting punishment" (kolasis aionion) of Matt 25:46 means eternal conscious torment, because the same adjective (aionios) modifies both "punishment" and "life," requiring identical duration and nature | I-B | ECT | FOR: E7/E126 (Matt 25:46 same adjective for both outcomes). AGAINST: E8/E207 (kolasis = punishment, not torment; 2 NT uses), E9/E404b (kolasis not basanismos), E19/E090 (2 Thess 1:9: olethros aionion = everlasting destruction), E30/E418 (none of 8 passages uses basanizo for humans), N1/N059 (destruction vocabulary pattern). The text says "punishment" (kolasis), not "torment" (basanismos). The claim requires: (a) interpreting kolasis as conscious ongoing suffering rather than penalty/infliction; (b) assuming aionios determines nature rather than duration-of-result. | The text does not say "everlasting torment." It says "everlasting punishment" (kolasis). The claim adds "conscious torment" as the meaning of kolasis when the text does not specify the form of the punishment. It also requires the same-duration-same-nature inference from the parallel adjective. | #1 (adding: conscious torment as meaning of kolasis), #2 (choosing: kolasis as ongoing process vs. result), #5 (systematizing) |
| I2 | The "everlasting punishment" (kolasis aionion) of Matt 25:46 is the death penalty — permanent destruction from which there is no return. The punishment is everlasting in its result/effect, not in its process. | I-A | Cond. | E7/E126 (Matt 25:46: "everlasting punishment"), E8/E207 (kolasis = penal infliction, only 2 NT uses), E19/E090 (2 Thess 1:9: olethros aionion, everlasting destruction — Paul's vocabulary for the same event), E22/E252 (Heb 10:27: fire devours), E25/E414 (Heb 10:39: perdition vs. salvation), N1/N059 (destruction vocabulary pattern across 8 passages). All from E/N tables. | This systematizes the punishment vocabulary (kolasis, olethros, apoleia, apollymi, katesthio) across the judgment passages to conclude that the kolasis is the death penalty applied permanently. Every component is text-derived. It is an inference because it extends the pattern to a conclusion about the nature of kolasis. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS: 2 Thess 1:9 "everlasting destruction" interprets Matt 25:46 "everlasting punishment" — same author's theological context [Paul]; didactic epistle interprets parabolic discourse; shared vocabulary aionios + penalty term) |
| I3 | Dan 12:2 "everlasting contempt" implies eternal conscious experience of shame — the wicked are forever ashamed and aware of their contempt | I-B | ECT | FOR: E11/E288 (olam modifies both life and contempt). AGAINST: E12/E267 (dera'on = how onlookers view the dead, occurs only with Isa 66:24 where subjects are peger/dead bodies), E13/E192 (Isa 66:24 subjects are dead bodies), N2/N060 (dera'on links Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24 — both describe how the living view the dead). The text does not state the wicked experience their contempt. Dera'on describes the reaction of the living, not the experience of the dead. | The text says "everlasting contempt." The claim adds consciousness to a word that describes how others view the subjects. The only other use of dera'on (Isa 66:24) describes the reaction of the living to dead bodies (peger). Reading dera'on as an experience of the wicked requires adding a concept the text does not contain. | #1 (adding: consciousness to a word describing onlookers' reaction), #2 (choosing: subject's experience vs. onlookers' reaction), #4b (cross-referencing without accounting for Isa 66:24 peger context) |
| I4 | Dan 12:2 "everlasting contempt" describes the permanent reputation/memory of the destroyed wicked — they are objects of perpetual abhorrence, as dead bodies | I-A | Cond. | E12/E267 (dera'on only in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24), E13/E192 (Isa 66:24 peger = dead bodies), E14/E406 (subjects of worm/fire are peger), N2/N060 (dera'on links both passages — onlookers viewing the dead). All from E/N tables. | This systematizes the only two uses of dera'on to conclude the word describes how the dead are viewed rather than what they experience. Every component is text-derived. It is an inference because it applies the Isa 66:24 meaning to Dan 12:2 as a categorical claim. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS: Isa 66:24 interprets Dan 12:2 — shared rare vocabulary H1860 dera'on, 2 total occurrences; Isa 66:24 context specifies peger/dead bodies as the objects of dera'on) |
| I5 | "Tribulation and anguish" (Rom 2:9) describe eternal conscious suffering — the wrath and tribulation continue forever | I-C | ECT | Rom 2:8-9 states "indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil." Rom 2:12 states sinners "perish" (apollymi). The text does not state that the tribulation and anguish continue forever. The passage mentions these as experiences of the judgment event. The claim extends them to an eternal state by adding duration the text does not specify. | The text lists tribulation and anguish as what evil-doers face. The claim adds "forever" — a duration the passage does not specify. The same passage (v.12) uses apollymi (perish) as the concluding outcome, suggesting the tribulation and anguish are part of the judgment process, not an eternal state. | #1 (adding: eternal duration to tribulation/anguish), #3 (applying: ECT framework that assumes consciousness after judgment) |
| I6 | "Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord" (2 Thess 1:9) means eternal separation from God in a state of ongoing conscious ruin, not actual destruction | I-D | ECT | E19/E090 (2 Thess 1:9: olethros = destruction). E20/E410 (olethros in all 4 NT uses = destruction/ruin). E262 (apollymi from same root = destroy fully). The text says "destruction" (olethros). The claim requires redefining olethros from its lexical meaning (destruction/ruin) to mean "ongoing existence in a state of conscious ruin." This overrides what the word means. | The text says "everlasting destruction." The claim requires olethros to mean something other than destruction — specifically, a state of conscious existence that is described as "ruined" but not actually destroyed. This overrides the lexical meaning of the word. | #1 (adding: conscious ongoing existence to a word meaning destruction), #2 (redefining: olethros from destruction to separation/ruin-as-state) |
| I7 | "Sorer punishment" (Heb 10:29) means eternal conscious torment because it must be worse than physical death (v.28) | I-C | ECT | Heb 10:28 says "died without mercy." Heb 10:29 says "sorer punishment" (timoria). Heb 10:27 says fire "shall devour" adversaries. Heb 10:39 contrasts "perdition" (apoleia) with "saving of the soul." The text does not define the "sorer punishment" as conscious torment. The passage's own vocabulary uses devour (v.27) and perdition/destruction (v.39). | The text says the punishment is "sorer" than death under the law. The claim adds that the specific way it is sorer is duration/consciousness of torment. The passage itself uses destruction vocabulary (devour, perdition) to describe the outcome, suggesting the "sorer punishment" is more severe destruction (destruction of soul and body, not just body). | #1 (adding: conscious torment as the specific form of "sorer"), #3 (applying: ECT framework to interpret "sorer") |
| I8 | The 8 judgment passages, read together, describe a pattern where the fate of the wicked is permanent destruction/death — the "everlasting punishment" is the death penalty applied permanently by God at the final judgment | I-A | Cond. | E30/E418 (no basanizo in any passage for humans), E31/E419 (4/8 passages use destruction vocabulary), E19/E090 (olethros), E22/E252 (devour), E25/E414 (perdition vs. salvation), E29/E417 (perish), E5/E394 (second death), E13/E192 (carcasses), E15/E407 (slain, consumed), N1/N059 (vocabulary pattern), N3/N061 (immortality sought, sinners perish). All from E/N tables. | This systematizes the vocabulary pattern across all 8 passages into a comprehensive conclusion. Every component is text-derived (all from E/N tables). It is an inference because it extends the pattern to a doctrinal claim. | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS: didactic passages — 2 Thess 1:9, Heb 10:27-39, Rom 2:5-12 — interpret parabolic/apocalyptic — Matt 25:46, Rev 20:11-15; shared subject matter; didactic > apocalyptic > parabolic in clarity) |

### I-B Resolution: I1 — "Everlasting Punishment" Means Eternal Conscious Torment

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR: E7/E126 (same adjective aionios modifies both punishment and life in Matt 25:46)
- AGAINST: E8/E207 (kolasis = punishment, not torment, 2 NT uses), E9/E404b (kolasis, not basanismos), E19/E090 (2 Thess 1:9: everlasting destruction — olethros), E30/E418 (none of 8 passages uses basanizo for humans), N1/N059 (destruction vocabulary pattern)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E7/E126 (same adjective) | Ambiguous | Observable grammatical fact, but what aionios means when modifying kolasis vs. zoe is disputed. Parabolic genre. |
| E8/E207 (kolasis = punishment) | Plain | Lexical fact. kolasis = penal infliction. 2 NT uses. |
| E9/E404b (kolasis not basanismos) | Plain | Observable vocabulary choice. |
| E19/E090 (everlasting destruction) | Plain | Didactic epistle. Paul's word choice is olethros. |
| E30/E418 (no basanizo in 8 passages) | Plain | Observable word count across 8 passages. |
| N1/N059 (destruction vocabulary pattern) | Plain | Follows from E-items. Observable pattern. |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
FOR: 1 Ambiguous item (same adjective in parabolic genre — aionios observation is grammatical fact but does not determine the nature of kolasis).
AGAINST: 5 Plain items (kolasis = punishment not torment; olethros in didactic epistle; no basanizo for humans; destruction pattern).

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
Plain items govern Ambiguous ones. 2 Thess 1:9 (didactic epistle) uses olethros (destruction) for the same eschatological event. Heb 10:27 (didactic) uses "devour" and "perdition." Rom 2:12 (didactic) uses apollymi (perish). The didactic passages (clearer genre) interpret the parabolic discourse (Matt 25:46). The word kolasis means punishment/penalty — the didactic passages specify this penalty as destruction.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong**
5 Plain items on the AGAINST side (lexical meaning of kolasis, didactic destruction vocabulary, no basanizo for humans) govern 1 Ambiguous item on the FOR side (same adjective in parabolic genre). The claim that kolasis = conscious torment requires adding a concept the text does not contain. Master I063 *NEW*.

### I-B Resolution: I3 — "Everlasting Contempt" Implies Conscious Experience

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR: E11/E288 (olam modifies both life and contempt)
- AGAINST: E12/E267 (dera'on = onlookers' reaction, only 2 uses), E13/E192 (Isa 66:24 subjects are peger/dead bodies), N2/N060 (dera'on links both passages — onlookers viewing the dead)

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E11/E288 (olam for both) | Ambiguous | Observable grammatical fact, but does not determine whether the contempt is experienced or observed. |
| E12/E267 (dera'on = onlookers' reaction) | Plain | Lexical fact confirmed by Isa 66:24 usage. |
| E13/E192 (peger = dead bodies) | Plain | Lexical fact. peger always = dead body/corpse. |
| N2/N060 (shared dera'on — onlookers view the dead) | Plain | Follows from E-items. |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
FOR: 1 Ambiguous item (olam modifies both — grammatical fact but does not determine whether dera'on is experienced or observed).
AGAINST: 3 Plain items (dera'on = how onlookers view; peger = dead bodies; shared vocabulary links the two dera'on passages).

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
Isa 66:24 (the only other use of dera'on) specifies the objects of dera'on as peger (dead bodies). The clearer passage (Isa 66:24, where the subject is explicitly peger) interprets the less clear passage (Dan 12:2, where "everlasting contempt" could theoretically be read as an experience). Shared rare vocabulary (2 total occurrences) = verified #4a connection.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Strong**
3 Plain items on the AGAINST side (dera'on = onlookers' reaction to dead bodies; peger = corpses) govern 1 Ambiguous item on the FOR side (olam modifies both outcomes). Master I064 *NEW*.

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases Scripture, or states an observable linguistic/distribution fact. Checked.
- Each uses plain lexical meaning without adding concepts. Checked.
- E-items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Checked.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- 7 Conditionalist items (E13/E192, E15/E407, E19/E090, E22/E252, E25/E414, E29/E417) have full Tree 3 documentation above. All four gates passed for each.
- No E-items classified ECT.
- 24 Neutral E-items are textual observations or distribution facts both sides accept.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- Each N-item follows unavoidably from cited E-items. Checked.
- Three N-tier tests applied to each. All pass (documented above).

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1 (I-B): E/N items on both sides. Checked.
- I2 (I-A): All components from E/N tables. Systematizes. Checked.
- I3 (I-B): E/N items on both sides. Checked.
- I4 (I-A): All components from E/N tables. Systematizes. Checked.
- I5 (I-C): Adds eternal duration not in E/N tables. External. Checked.
- I6 (I-D): Overrides olethros lexical meaning. Counter-evidence external. Checked.
- I7 (I-C): Adds conscious torment as form of "sorer." External. Compatible. Checked.
- I8 (I-A): All components from E/N tables. Systematizes. Checked.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1 (I-B): Requires kolasis to mean torment (conflicts with lexical value). Checked.
- I2 (I-A): Uses only E/N vocabulary. Aligns. Checked.
- I3 (I-B): Requires dera'on to mean conscious experience (conflicts with Isa 66:24 peger context). Checked.
- I4 (I-A): Uses only E/N vocabulary. Aligns. Checked.
- I5 (I-C): Adds duration. Compatible external. Checked.
- I6 (I-D): Requires olethros to not mean destruction. Overrides. Checked.
- I7 (I-C): Adds conscious torment. Compatible external. Checked.
- I8 (I-A): Uses only E/N vocabulary. Aligns. Checked.

**Step E: Consistency checks.**
- I-A (I2, I4, I8): Only require criterion #5 and #4a. Confirmed.
- I-B (I1, I3): E/N items on both sides. Confirmed.
- I-C (I5, I7): Do not override E/N. Compatible. Confirmed.
- I-D (I6): Overrides E19/E090 (olethros = destruction). Confirmed.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- 2 Thess 1:9 → Matt 25:46: Shared aionios + penalty terminology; same eschatological event; didactic > parabolic. #4a verified.
- Isa 66:24 → Dan 12:2: Shared rare vocabulary H1860 dera'on (2 total OT occurrences); Isa 66:24 specifies peger as objects of dera'on. #4a verified.
- Didactic epistles (2 Thess, Heb, Rom) → parabolic/apocalyptic (Matt 25, Rev 20): Shared subject matter (final fate of wicked); didactic > apocalyptic > parabolic in genre clarity. #4a verified.

| 2026-02-20 | etc-14 | E404-E419, N059-N061, I063-I070 | "Judgment Passages" study (42 items: 17 new E, 3 new N, 8 new I; plus 14 existing items with "Also In" updates). Eight major judgment passages analyzed for vocabulary used. Zero of 8 passages use basanizo (torment) for human wicked. Four use explicit destruction/death vocabulary: Rev 20 ("second death"), 2 Thess 1 (olethros), Heb 10 (devour/apoleia), Rom 2 (apollymi). Two use penalty/judgment vocabulary without specifying nature: Matt 25 (kolasis), John 5 (krisis). Two describe the dead viewed with abhorrence: Dan 12 (dera'on), Isa 66 (peger + dera'on). Two I-B items (kolasis = torment; dera'on = conscious experience) both resolved Strong. One I-D item: redefining olethros overrides lexical meaning. |

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture Explicitly States or Necessarily Implies)

1. The 8 major judgment passages collectively use destruction/death vocabulary (thanatos, olethros, katesthio, apoleia, apollymi) for the fate of the human wicked. None of the 8 uses basanizo (torment) for human subjects.

2. Rev 20:11-15 describes the Great White Throne judgment where humans are judged "according to their works." Those not in the book of life are "cast into the lake of fire," which the text identifies as "the second death" (thanatos). No torment vocabulary is used for human subjects.

3. Matt 25:46 states the wicked go to "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion) and the righteous to "life eternal" (zoen aionion). The word kolasis (punishment/penalty) appears only twice in the NT (Matt 25:46, 1 John 4:18). The text uses kolasis, not basanismos (torment).

4. Dan 12:2 states the dead awake to either "everlasting life" or "shame and everlasting contempt" (dera'on). Dera'on occurs only twice in the OT (Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24). In Isa 66:24, the objects of dera'on are peger (dead bodies/carcasses).

5. Isa 66:24 describes the living going forth to look upon "carcases" (peger — dead bodies, 22 OT occurrences, always = corpse) of transgressors. The worm and fire act upon dead bodies. The context (vv.16-17) states the transgressors were "slain" and "consumed."

6. John 5:29 describes the "resurrection of life" and the "resurrection of damnation" (krisis — judgment/decision). The word krisis appears in vv.22, 24, 27, 29, 30 — all meaning judgment/decision, not torment.

7. 2 Thess 1:9 states the punishment is "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion). Olethros appears 4 times in the NT, always meaning destruction/ruin. This is a didactic epistle — Paul directly teaching a church.

8. Heb 10:27 states fire will "devour" the adversaries. Heb 10:28 uses death under Moses' law as the paradigm. Heb 10:29 asks about "sorer punishment" (timoria). Heb 10:39 contrasts "perdition" (apoleia — destruction) with "saving of the soul."

9. Rom 2:7 states those who seek "immortality" (aphtharsia) receive "eternal life." Rom 2:8-9 states the disobedient face "indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish." Rom 2:12 states sinners "perish" (apollymi).

## What CANNOT Be Said (Not Explicitly Stated or Necessarily Implied by Scripture)

1. **It cannot be said that any of the 8 judgment passages uses basanizo (torment) for the fate of human wicked.** The word does not appear in any of these passages in reference to humans. Claims of torment in these passages require adding vocabulary the text does not use.

2. **It cannot be said that kolasis (Matt 25:46) means "torment."** kolasis means punishment/penalty (penal infliction). Its lexical meaning is not equivalent to basanismos (torment). The text says "punishment," not "torment."

3. **It cannot be said that dera'on (Dan 12:2) describes what the wicked experience.** The only other use of dera'on (Isa 66:24) describes the reaction of the living to dead bodies (peger). The word describes how the dead are viewed, not what they experience.

4. **It cannot be said that Isa 66:24 describes conscious beings.** The subjects are peger (carcasses/dead bodies). The word peger never refers to living persons in its 22 OT occurrences.

5. **It cannot be said that olethros (2 Thess 1:9) means "ongoing conscious ruin."** Olethros means destruction. In all 4 NT uses, it means destruction/ruin. Redefining the word to mean "conscious ongoing existence in ruined state" overrides its lexical meaning.

6. **It cannot be said that "sorer punishment" (Heb 10:29) specifically means eternal conscious torment.** The passage does not define the nature of the "sorer punishment." The passage's own vocabulary uses "devour" (v.27) and "perdition" (v.39) — destruction terms.

7. **It cannot be said that "tribulation and anguish" (Rom 2:9) are eternal.** The text does not specify the duration. The same passage uses "perish" (apollymi, v.12) as the concluding outcome vocabulary.

## Conclusion

This study examined 31 explicit statements, 3 necessary implications, and 8 inferences across 8 major judgment passages.

7 explicit statements are classified Conditionalist: Isa 66:24 peger/carcasses (E192), Isa 66:16-17 slain/consumed (E407), 2 Thess 1:9 everlasting destruction (E090), Heb 10:27 fire devours (E252), Heb 10:39 perdition vs. salvation (E414), Rom 2:12 sinners perish (E417). All passed Tree 3 four-gate validation. 0 explicit statements are classified ECT. 24 explicit statements are classified Neutral.

3 necessary implications are Neutral: N059 (vocabulary pattern — destruction, not torment, across 8 passages), N060 (dera'on links Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24 — onlookers viewing the dead), N061 (Rom 2:7 immortality sought; 2:12 sinners perish).

3 I-A inferences systematize the E/N evidence: I065 (kolasis = permanent death penalty), I066 (dera'on = permanent reputation of the destroyed), I070 (8 passages describe permanent destruction). 2 I-B inferences (I063: kolasis = torment; I064: dera'on = conscious experience) were both resolved Strong. 2 I-C inferences (I067: tribulation/anguish = eternal; I069: sorer punishment = torment) add concepts the text does not contain but do not override what it says. 1 I-D inference (I068: olethros = conscious separation) overrides the lexical meaning of olethros.
