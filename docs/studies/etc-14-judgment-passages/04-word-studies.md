## Greek Judgment Vocabulary

### G2920 — krisis (κρίσις) — Judgment / Condemnation

**Strong's Lookup:**
- 34 total NT occurrences
- 6 unique KJV translations:
  - judgment (18x = 52.9%)
  - of judgment (8x = 23.5%)
  - damnation (2x = 5.9%)
  - the judgment (2x = 5.9%)
  - accusation (2x = 5.9%)
  - judgments (2x = 5.9%)

**BLB Lexical definition:** From G2919 (krinō = to judge, separate, decide); refers to the process or act of judging, or the verdict/decision rendered. Also used for the state of being condemned.

**Key eschatological uses:**
- Jhn 5:29: eis anastasin **kriseōs** (G-GSF) = "unto the resurrection of judgment/damnation"
- Heb 10:27: **kriseōs** (G-GSF) = "fearful looking for of judgment"
- Mat 25:46: (uses kolasis, not krisis — distinct terms)

**Critical lexical note for Jhn 5:29:** The KJV translates kriseōs as "damnation" (the only NT use of this word as "damnation" in this grammatical context). However, the Greek word is krisis (judicial verdict/judgment), not basanismos (torment). The resurrection of the wicked is named for the judicial outcome (verdict), not for the experiential content (torment).

### G2917 — krima (κρίμα) — Condemnation / Judgment

**Strong's Lookup:**
- 25 total NT occurrences
- 9 unique KJV translations:
  - judgment (9x = 36%)
  - damnation (7x = 28%)
  - condemnation (3x = 12%)
  - be condemned (1x = 4%)
  - judgments (1x = 4%)
  - to law (1x = 4%)
  - his judgment (1x = 4%)
  - the condemnation (1x = 4%)
  - that judgment (1x = 4%)

**Eschatological uses:** Heb 6:2 "eternal judgment" uses krima aiōnion (not krisis). See Hebrews section below.

### G3709 — orgē (ὀργή) — Wrath

**Strong's Lookup:**
- 33 total NT occurrences
- 7 unique KJV translations:
  - wrath (21x = 63.6%)
  - the wrath (3x = 9.1%)
  - anger (3x = 9.1%)
  - of wrath (3x = 9.1%)
  - vengeance (1x = 3%)
  - unto wrath (1x = 3%)
  - indignation (1x = 3%)

**Parsing in Rom 2:8:** G3709 N-NSF (Nominative Singular Feminine) = orgē is the GRAMMATICAL SUBJECT standing in apposition to thumos — it is what accrues to those who disobey the truth. The wrath is judicial, not described as eternal torment.

---

### G2372 — thumos (θυμός) — Indignation / Wrath / Fury

**Strong's Lookup:**
- 18 total NT occurrences
- 6 unique KJV translations:
  - wrath (12x = 66.7%)
  - fierceness (2x = 11.1%)
  - with wrath (1x = 5.6%)
  - of wrath (1x = 5.6%)
  - indignation (1x = 5.6%)
  - wraths (1x = 5.6%)

**Parsing in Rom 2:8:** G2372 N-NSM (Nominative Singular Masculine) = thumos paired with orgē as the twin judicial results. KJV renders thumos as "indignation" in Rom 2:8 specifically.

**Distinction from orgē:** Both words are used for wrath, but thumos tends toward the passionate, burning aspect (from thyō = to rush, boil) while orgē is the settled judicial anger. Paul uses both together in Rom 2:8 for emphasis.

---

### G2631 — katakrima (κατάκριμα) — Condemnation (Verdict)

**Strong's Lookup:**
- 3 total NT occurrences
- 1 unique KJV translation:
  - condemnation (100%)

**Uses:** Rom 5:16; 5:18; 8:1 — all referring to the judicial verdict of condemnation (contrasted with justification). Not a torment term.

---

### G2632 — katakrinō (κατακρίνω) — To Condemn

**Strong's Lookup:**
- 17 total NT occurrences
- 12 unique KJV translations (various forms of "condemn")

**Key uses:** Mat 12:41-42 (Ninevites/Queen of South will "condemn" this generation in judgment); Mat 27:3 (Judas sees Jesus "condemned"); Mk 16:16 (he that believeth not "shall be damned"); Rom 2:1 (thou that judgest "condemnest" thyself). Verb of judicial verdict, not of torment process.

---

### G166 — aiōnios (αἰώνιος) — Eternal / Everlasting

**Strong's Lookup:**
- 48 total NT occurrences
- 12 unique KJV translations:
  - eternal (19x = 39.6%)
  - everlasting (13x = 27.1%)
  - of eternal (7x = 14.6%)
  - since the world began (1x), the world began (1x), the world (1x) — past-time uses

**Uses in this study's passages:**
- Heb 6:2: "eternal judgment" (krima aiōnion)
- 2Th 1:9: "everlasting destruction" (olethron aiōnion) — already analyzed in etc5-08 (E210)
- Mat 25:46: "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aiōnion) and "life eternal" (zōen aiōnion) — already analyzed as E208, E209

**Contextual note:** As established in etc5-07 and etc5-08, aionios is a denominal adjective from aion (age) meaning "pertaining to the age" or "age-long." Duration is contextually determined by the referent's nature (N034, N035).

---

### G386 — anastasis (ἀνάστασις) — Resurrection

**Strong's Lookup:**
- 37 total NT occurrences
- 8 unique KJV translations:
  - resurrection (24x = 64.9%)
  - the resurrection (7x = 18.9%)
  - rising again (1x), of the resurrection (1x), a resurrection (1x), that should rise (1x), of resurrection (1x), raised to life again (1x)

**Uses in this study:**
- Jhn 5:29: anastasim zōēs (resurrection of life) / anastasim kriseōs (resurrection of judgment)
- Act 24:15: anastasim nekrōn (resurrection of the dead) — both just and unjust
- Heb 6:2: anastaseōs nekrōn (resurrection of the dead) — foundational doctrine

---

### H8199 — shaphat (שָׁפַט) — To Judge

**Strong's Lookup:**
- 220 total OT occurrences
- Primary KJV renderings: judge (13x), the judge (9x), judged (9x), to judge (8x), judges (8x)

**Usage notes:** The primary OT verb for divine judicial action. Used for God's eschatological judgment of the nations (Psa 96:13; 98:9) and for the judge-role of the messianic figure (Dan 7:9-10). The concept of God sitting in judgment to evaluate works by record/book is OT background for Rev 20:12.

## OT Vocabulary Specific to This Study

### H1860 — dir'on (דֵּרָאוֹן) — Contempt / Abhorring

**Occurrence:** Only 2 times in all Hebrew Scripture:
- Dan 12:2: "everlasting contempt" (dir'on olam)
- Isa 66:24: "they shall be an abhorring (dir'on) unto all flesh"

**Lexical definition (BDB):** "abhorrence, repulsion" — the emotional/relational response of loathing. Not an experiential torment term for the object; it describes how others regard the object.

**Connection:** The same word appears in both Dan 12:2 (those who rise to shame and contempt) and Isa 66:24 (the carcases that are the abhorring of all flesh). In Isa 66:24, the objects of the dir'on are pigrê (H6297 = corpses). This lexical link connects Dan 12:2's "everlasting contempt" with Isa 66:24's "carcases" that are the "abhorring."

---

### H6297 — peger (פֶּגֶר) — Corpse / Dead Body / Carcase

**Key occurrence:** Isa 66:24 — pigrê (plural construct: "carcases of")

**Lexical definition (BDB):** "corpse, dead body" — always denotes a dead, inert body. Never used for a living person. The word consistently refers to lifeless remains.

**Significance:** The objects on which the worm and fire act in Isa 66:24 are pigrê — not nefashot (souls), not people (anashim alone), but corpses. This is the Hebrew noun for dead bodies, confirmed by etc5-05 analysis (E141).

## Word Study: The Judgment Vocabulary in Rev 20:12

Greek parsing of key terms in Rev 20:12 (N1904):
- νεκρούς (G3498, A-APM) = "dead" — adjective substantivized, Acc Pl M
- ἑστῶτας (G2476, V-RAP-APM) = "standing" — Perfect Active Participle, Acc Pl M (completed standing action)
- ἐκρίθησαν (G2919, V-API-3P) = "were judged" — Aorist Passive Indicative 3rd Pl (krinō = to judge)
- κατὰ τὰ ἔργα (kata ta erga) = "according to their works"

**Key finding:** The judgment verb is krinō (to judge, evaluate, decide) — not basanizō (to torment). The criterion is erga (works). No torment vocabulary appears anywhere in the Great White Throne description (Rev 20:11-15). The judgment is forensic/judicial.

## Word Study: Romans 2:5-9 — Judgment Day Vocabulary

**Wrath vocabulary in context:**
- v.5: orgē (G3709) = "wrath" — "day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God"
- v.8: orgē (G3709, N-NSF) + thumos (G2372, N-NSM) = "indignation and wrath" — nominative case: these come UPON the disobedient
- v.9: thlipsis (G2347) = "tribulation/affliction" — standard NT word for distress/pressure
- v.9: stenochōria (G4730) = "anguish/distress/narrowness" — lit. "narrow place," metaphor for extreme pressure/distress

**Paul's structural pattern in Rom 2:7-10:**
| The Obedient | The Disobedient |
|---|---|
| Eternal life (v.7) | Wrath and indignation (v.8) |
| Glory, honour, peace (v.10) | Tribulation and anguish (v.9) |

The language describes the judgment event and its consequences. Paul does not specify the duration of the tribulation and anguish in vv.8-9. The passage moves immediately to the universality of the judgment (v.11: "no respect of persons") and judgment according to works (v.12: "shall also perish [apollumi] without law").

Critically: v.12 — "shall also **perish** [apollumi] without law" — Paul's summary of the wicked's final outcome uses G622 (apollumi = destroy/perish completely), the destruction vocabulary.

## Word Study: Hebrews 6:2 — "Eternal Judgment"

**Hebrews 6:1-2 lists six foundational doctrines:**
1. Repentance from dead works
2. Faith toward God
3. Doctrine of baptisms
4. Laying on of hands
5. Resurrection of the dead
6. **Eternal judgment** (krima aiōnion)

**Greek phrase (from context):** krima aiōnion — judgment (verdict/decision) + aiōnios (age-long/eternal). The aionios here modifies the judgment/verdict, not the duration of conscious experience of punishment. "Eternal judgment" = a judgment whose verdict is permanent and irreversible — the decision stands for the age.

**Comparison:** Rev 14:6 uses "everlasting gospel" (euangelion aiōnion) — the gospel that endures/pertains to the age. The "everlasting" modifies the gospel itself. Similarly, "eternal judgment" = the judgment whose verdict endures/cannot be appealed.

---

## Word Study: Hebrews 10:27 — "Fiery Indignation which shall Devour"

**Greek parsing (N1904):**
- φοβερὰ (G5398, A-NSF) = "fearful" — modifying ἐκδοχὴ
- ἐκδοχὴ (G1561, N-NSF) = "expectation/looking for" — SUBJECT
- κρίσεως (G2920, N-GSF) = "of judgment"
- πυρὸς ζῆλος = "fire's zeal/indignation" — the burning jealousy/indignation of fire
- ἐσθίειν (G2068, V-PAN) = "to eat/devour" — the action of the fire
- μέλλοντος (G3195, V-PAP-GSN) = "being about to" — modifying the fire's consuming action
- τοὺς ὑπεναντίους (G5227, A-APM) = "the adversaries/opponents"

**Key finding:** The fire's action is esthiein — "to eat/devour" (consumption vocabulary), NOT basanizō (torment). The fire devours the adversaries — consumption, not ongoing conscious torment. This uses the same consumption vocabulary as Rev 20:9 (katephagen — devoured the nations) established in E180.

## Word Study: 2 Thessalonians 1:9 — Full Parsing (already in E210, adding context)

**The parousia timing context (vv.7-10):**
- v.7: "when the Lord Jesus shall be REVEALED (apokalupsei) from heaven with his mighty angels"
- v.8: "In flaming fire taking vengeance"
- v.9: "who shall suffer the penalty of EVERLASTING DESTRUCTION (olethron aiōnion) from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his power"
- v.10: "**WHEN** he shall come to be glorified in his saints" — the "when" clause governs v.9; the destruction occurs at the parousia event, not as an ongoing eternal process starting at death

**Structural conclusion:** The punishment is tied to a specific eschatological event (the Lord's appearing), not described as an eternal process of ongoing suffering beginning at death. The parousia itself is the moment of judgment.
