# etc-14: Judgment Passages — Word Studies

## G2851: kolasis (punishment)
- **Definition:** From kolazo; penal infliction; punishment, torment
- **NT Occurrences:** 2 (extremely rare)
  - Matt 25:46 — "everlasting punishment" (KJV)
  - 1 John 4:18 — "fear hath torment/punishment" (KJV)
- **Lexical note:** kolasis is derived from kolazo (G2849), meaning "to curtail, prune, check, restrain." The noun kolasis emphasizes the corrective/penal nature of punishment. In classical Greek, kolasis was distinguished from timoria: kolasis focused on the subject's correction, while timoria focused on the satisfaction of the punisher. In NT usage, kolasis appears only twice.
- **Translation:** KJV renders it "punishment" in Matt 25:46

## G2920: krisis (judgment/decision)
- **Definition:** Decision (subjectively or objectively, for or against); judgment, condemnation
- **NT Occurrences:** 48 (BLB count), 34 unique KJV occurrences
- **KJV translations:** "judgment" (18x), "of judgment" (8x), "damnation" (2x), "the judgment" (2x), "accusation" (2x), "judgments" (2x)
- **Key occurrences in study passages:**
  - John 5:29 — "resurrection of damnation" (anastasis kriseos — literally "resurrection of judgment")
  - John 5:24 — "shall not come into condemnation" (krisis)
  - John 5:27 — "authority to execute judgment" (krisis)
  - John 5:30 — "my judgment is just" (krisis)
  - Heb 10:27 — "fearful looking for of judgment" (krisis)
- **Note:** The KJV translates krisis as "damnation" in John 5:29, but the same word is translated "judgment" in 5:22, 5:24, 5:27, 5:30. The word itself means judgment/decision, not damnation specifically.

## G2917: krima (judgment/sentence)
- **Definition:** From krino; a decision (the function or the effect, for or against)
- **NT Occurrences:** 28
- **KJV translations:** Various — "judgment," "condemnation," "damnation"
- **Distinction from krisis:** krima tends to emphasize the result/verdict; krisis emphasizes the process/act of judging

## G3639: olethros (destruction/ruin)
- **Definition:** From ollymi (to destroy); ruin, destruction
- **NT Occurrences:** 4
- **All occurrences:**
  - 1 Cor 5:5 — "destruction of the flesh"
  - 1 Thess 5:3 — "sudden destruction cometh upon them"
  - 2 Thess 1:9 — "everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord"
  - 1 Tim 6:9 — "drowning men in destruction and perdition"
- **KJV translations:** "destruction" (3x), "the destruction" (1x)
- **Note:** olethros consistently means destruction/ruin. It is derived from ollymi (to destroy), the same root as apollymi (G622). Paul uses it for the fate of the wicked in 2 Thess 1:9.

## G5098: timoria (punishment)
- **Definition:** From timoreo; vindication, penalty, punishment
- **NT Occurrences:** 1 (hapax legomenon in noun form)
  - Heb 10:29 — "sorer punishment"
- **Classical distinction:** timoria focuses on the satisfaction due to the offended party (retributive), while kolasis focuses on the correction of the offender. Both appear once each in these judgment passages.

## G684: apoleia (destruction/perdition)
- **Definition:** From apollymi; ruin, loss, destruction, perdition
- **NT Occurrences:** 17
- **KJV translations:** "perdition" (5x), "destruction" (4x), "waste" (2x), "perish" (1x), "die" (1x), "damnable" (1x), "pernicious ways" (1x), "damnation" (1x)
- **Key occurrence:** Heb 10:39 — "draw back unto perdition" (apoleia) contrasted with "saving of the soul"
- **Note:** apoleia is from the same root as apollymi (G622, "destroy/perish"). The word carries destruction/ruin meaning.

## H1860: dera'on (contempt/abhorrence)
- **Definition:** From an unused root meaning to repulse; an object of aversion; abhorring, contempt
- **OT Occurrences:** 2 (extremely rare)
  - Dan 12:2 — "everlasting contempt"
  - Isa 66:24 — "an abhorring unto all flesh"
- **Note:** This word appears ONLY in these two passages. Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24 share this rare vocabulary. In Isa 66:24, it describes the reaction of the living to "carcases" (peger) — dead bodies, not living beings. The word describes how the transgressors are viewed (with aversion/repulsion), not what they experience.

## H6297: peger (carcass/corpse)
- **Definition:** From pagar (to be exhausted/faint); a carcass, corpse, dead body
- **OT Occurrences:** 22
- **Usage:** Always refers to a dead body, never a living person
- **Key passages:**
  - Gen 15:11 — birds of prey on carcasses
  - Lev 26:30 — carcasses upon idols
  - Num 14:29,32 — carcasses in wilderness
  - 1 Sam 17:46 — carcasses of Philistines
  - Isa 14:19 — cast out like abominable branch, clothed with slain
  - Isa 34:3 — dead bodies stink
  - Isa 66:24 — "carcases of the men that have transgressed"
  - Nah 3:3 — great number of carcasses
- **Critical observation:** In Isa 66:24, the subjects viewed are peger — dead bodies. The worm and fire act upon corpses, not living conscious beings. This is decomposition imagery.
