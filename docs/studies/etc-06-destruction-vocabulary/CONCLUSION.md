# Destruction Vocabulary -- Hebrew and Greek Words for the Fate of the Wicked

## Question
Hebrew/Greek destruction vocabulary: abad/apollumi (H6/G622), shamad (H8045), kalah (H3615), shachath (H7843), apoleia (G684), olethros (G3639). Lexical definitions, eschatological usage, the "perish vs. life" contrast pattern, destruction similes, and how these words function when applied to the fate of the wicked.

## Summary Answer
The Bible's primary vocabulary for describing the fate of the wicked consists of destruction/cessation words, not torment words. Four Hebrew words -- abad (H6, ~184 occurrences: to perish, to destroy), shamad (H8045, ~90 occurrences: to destroy utterly, to exterminate), kalah (H3615, ~206 occurrences: to consume, to finish), and shachath (H7843, ~147 occurrences: to corrupt, to decay, to ruin) -- form the OT destruction vocabulary. Three Greek words -- apollymi (G622, ~92 occurrences: to destroy fully, to perish), apoleia (G684, ~20 occurrences: destruction, perdition), and olethros (G3639, 4 occurrences: destruction, ruin) -- form the NT destruction vocabulary. The LXX translation patterns confirm cross-testament vocabulary continuity: abad maps to apollymi 141 times; shamad maps to apollymi 23 times; shachath maps to diaphtheiro 48 times; kalah maps to synteleo 85 times. The abad-apollymi-apoleia lexical chain (~296 combined occurrences) is the dominant vocabulary for the fate of the wicked across both testaments. No lexicon defines any of these words as "torment" or "ongoing conscious suffering." The destruction similes (chaff, wax, smoke, ashes, stubble, morning clouds) uniformly depict substances that are consumed and cease to exist. The "perish vs. life" contrast pattern appears across multiple authors (John 3:16; Matt 7:13-14; Rom 6:23; Phil 3:19; Psa 1:6; Psa 145:20; Mal 4:1-3): life and destruction are presented as opposite outcomes. The ECT position reads destruction vocabulary as metaphorical for spiritual ruin rather than cessation; this reading requires the destruction words to mean something other than their lexical definitions and the destruction similes to depict something other than what they naturally illustrate.

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Position | Why Unavoidable | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | The abad-apollymi lexical chain is verified by LXX translation (141 times); when the NT uses apollymi for the fate of the wicked, it uses the same word the LXX uses to translate the OT's primary destruction verb | E1/E212 (LXX: abad -> apollymi 141x), E24/E028 (apollymi in Matt 10:28), E25/E075 (apollymi in John 3:16) | Neutral | The LXX translation is a verifiable textual fact. Both sides accept that apollymi translates abad. | N027 *NEW* |
| N2 | The "perish vs. life" contrast is a structural pattern across multiple authors: the two outcomes are presented as antithetical, not as two forms of continued existence | E25/E075 (John 3:16: perish vs. life), E23/E233 (Matt 7:13-14: destruction vs. life), E48/E087 (Rom 6:23: death vs. life), E32/E240 (Phil 3:19: destruction vs. glory), E12/E223 (Psa 145:20: destroy vs. preserve) | Neutral | Five passages from four authors present this contrast. The structural pattern is observable. Both sides acknowledge the textual contrast; they disagree about what "perish/destroy" means. | N028 *NEW* |
| N3 | All biblical destruction similes for the wicked depict substances that cease to exist: chaff burned, wax melting, smoke dissipating, stubble consumed, ashes remaining, dew evaporating, morning clouds passing | E9/E220 (wax), E6/E217 (smoke, fat consumed), E38/E245 (stubble, no root or branch), E39/E246 (ashes), E41/E248 (clouds, dew, chaff, smoke), E42/E249 (stubble devoured) | Neutral | These are observable properties of the natural substances named. Wax melts, smoke dissipates, chaff burns, stubble is consumed. Both sides accept what these substances do; they disagree about whether the similes are meant to depict the actual fate or merely its severity. | N029 *NEW* |
| N4 | The destruction vocabulary (apollymi, apoleia, olethros) and the torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos, kolasis) are distinct word families with different semantic ranges | E56/E260 (distinct word families), E58/E262 (apollymi = "to destroy fully"), E60/E264 (no destruction word means "torment") | Neutral | These are different Greek words with different definitions. Both sides accept the words are different; they disagree about whether the destruction words are metaphorical. | N030 *NEW* |

**N-tier verification (3-question test applied to each):**

- **N1/N027:** (1) Both ECT and Conditionalist scholars agree the LXX translates abad as apollymi 141 times. YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N2/N028:** (1) Both sides acknowledge the textual contrast between "perish/destroy" and "life." YES. (2) The observation is that the contrast exists; interpreting what it means would be I-tier. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N3/N029:** (1) Both sides accept what these substances naturally do. YES. (2) One meaning (what the substances do). YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

- **N4/N030:** (1) Both sides agree these are different word families. YES. (2) One meaning. YES. (3) Zero added. YES. PASSES.

### 3. Inferences Table

| # | Claim | Type | Position | What the Bible Actually Says | Why This Is an Inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| I1 | The Bible's destruction vocabulary for the fate of the wicked means cessation of existence: the wicked perish, are destroyed, consumed, and cease to be | I-A | Cond. | E5-E22/E216-E232 (abad, shamad, kalah used for the wicked across Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Isaiah); E23-E34/E233-E242 (apollymi, apoleia used for the wicked across Gospels, Paul, Peter); E35/E090 (olethros aionios = everlasting destruction); E38-E42/E245-E249 (destruction similes: stubble burned, ashes, devoured); E7/E218 (Psa 37:10: "shall not be"); E13/E224 (Psa 59:13: "that they may not be"); E14/E225 (Psa 104:35: "be no more"); E40/E247 (Oba 1:16: "as though they had not been"). | This systematizes ~40 E-items from ~15 biblical authors into a comprehensive claim. Every component is found in the E/N tables. It is an inference only because it draws a conclusion from the cumulative pattern. Uses only criterion #5 (systematizing) and #4a (LXX-verified vocabulary chain). | #5 (systematizing), #4a (SIS) |
| I2 | The Bible's destruction vocabulary is metaphorical: "perish" means spiritual ruin (continued existence in a ruined state), "destroy" means inflict irreparable loss, and the similes depict severity rather than cessation | I-B | ECT-direction | FOR: E61/E126 (Matt 25:46: "everlasting punishment" -- punishment implies a subject who experiences it); E63/E265 (Rev 14:10-11: "tormented... smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever"); E44/E251 (Matt 13:42: "wailing and gnashing of teeth" in furnace -- implies conscious experience). AGAINST: E60/E264 (no destruction word lexically means "torment"); E57/E261 (apollymi for wineskins = physical ruin/cessation, not torment); E7/E218 (Psa 37:10: "shall not be"); E13/E224 (Psa 59:13: "that they may not be"); E14/E225 (Psa 104:35: "be no more"); E40/E247 (Oba 1:16: "as though they had not been"); all E-items using abad, shamad, kalah, apollymi, apoleia, olethros. | The claim requires every destruction word to mean something other than what the lexicons define it as, and every destruction simile to depict something other than what the natural process involves. The FOR evidence comes from torment-vocabulary passages (Rev 14:10-11, in apocalyptic genre) and one parabolic image (wailing in furnace), while the AGAINST evidence comes from 40+ didactic passages using destruction vocabulary across both testaments. | #1 (adding "spiritual ruin" meaning not in lexicons), #2 (choosing between lexical and metaphorical readings), #4b (using torment passages to redefine destruction passages) |
| I3 | The phrase "everlasting destruction" (olethros aionios, 2 Thess 1:9) means ongoing destruction that never ends (an eternal process of being destroyed), not destruction whose result is permanent | I-B | ECT-direction | FOR: E61/E126 (aionios modifies both "punishment" and "life" in Matt 25:46; since "everlasting life" means ongoing life, "everlasting punishment/destruction" should mean ongoing destruction). AGAINST: E55/E259 (olethros = "ruin, i.e. death, punishment" -- a completed state, not an ongoing process); E10/E221 (Psa 92:7: "destroyed for ever" -- shamad parallels olethros aionios); E17/E228 (Job 20:7: "perish for ever" -- abad parallels olethros aionios); E62/E202 (Jude 1:7: "eternal fire" applied to Sodom -- the fire is not still burning; the destruction is permanent). | The claim requires olethros to be read as an ongoing process when the word means "ruin/death" (a result, not a process). It requires "everlasting" to modify the process rather than the result. Compare: "everlasting salvation" (Heb 5:9) does not mean an ongoing process of being saved but a salvation whose result is permanent. "Everlasting redemption" (Heb 9:12) does not mean an ongoing process of being redeemed. The same pattern: "everlasting destruction" = destruction whose result is permanent. | #2 (choosing between result-oriented and process-oriented readings of aionios + noun), #4b (importing Matt 25:46 pattern onto 2 Thess 1:9 without verified textual connection) |
| I4 | "Wailing and gnashing of teeth" in a furnace of fire (Matt 13:42,50) describes eternal conscious torment, not the anguish of those being destroyed | I-B | ECT-direction | FOR: E44/E251 (Matt 13:42: "wailing and gnashing of teeth" implies conscious experience in the furnace). AGAINST: E24/E028 (Matt 10:28: same author Matthew uses apollymi/destroy for gehenna); E23/E233 (Matt 7:13: same author uses apoleia/destruction); E6/E217 (Psa 37:20: consume into smoke); E38/E245 (Mal 4:1: stubble burned up). | The claim requires "wailing and gnashing" to describe an ongoing state rather than the moment of being cast in (as a person being thrown into a furnace wails at the point of destruction). It also requires this parabolic imagery (the parable of the tares) to override same-author didactic statements (Matt 10:28: destroy soul and body). | #2 (choosing between momentary anguish and ongoing state), #3 (parabolic genre treated as didactic) |

### I-B Resolution: I2 -- Destruction Vocabulary Is Metaphorical for Spiritual Ruin

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E126 (Matt 25:46: everlasting punishment implies ongoing experience), E265 (Rev 14:10-11: torment and smoke ascending forever), E251 (Matt 13:42: wailing and gnashing)
- AGAINST: E264 (no destruction word lexically means torment), E261 (apollymi for wineskins = physical ruin), E218 (Psa 37:10: "shall not be"), E224 (Psa 59:13: "that they may not be"), E225 (Psa 104:35: "be no more"), E247 (Oba 1:16: "as though they had not been"), plus all ~40 E-items using destruction vocabulary

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E126 (Matt 25:46) | Contextually Clear | kolasis (punishment), not apollymi (destruction). The word is from the torment vocabulary family, not the destruction vocabulary family. It does not define what destruction words mean. |
| E265 (Rev 14:10-11) | Ambiguous | Apocalyptic genre. Uses basanizo (torment), not destruction vocabulary. Specific subjects (beast-worshippers). Does not define destruction words. |
| E251 (Matt 13:42) | Ambiguous | Parabolic genre (parable of the tares). "Wailing and gnashing" could occur at the moment of destruction. |
| E264 (no destruction word means torment) | Plain | Lexical fact. No lexicon defines abad, shamad, kalah, shachath, apollymi, apoleia, or olethros as "torment." |
| E261 (wineskins perish) | Plain | apollymi used for a physical object that ceases to function. The word's meaning is visible in non-theological usage. |
| E218 (Psa 37:10: shall not be) | Plain | Direct statement. Non-existence language. |
| E224 (Psa 59:13: may not be) | Plain | Direct statement. Goal of consumption: non-existence. |
| E225 (Psa 104:35: be no more) | Plain | Direct statement. Non-existence language. |
| E247 (Oba 1:16: as though they had not been) | Plain | Direct statement. Non-existence language. |
| All destruction vocabulary E-items | Plain | Each uses destruction words in their lexical meaning. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 1 Contextually Clear item (Matt 25:46, which uses kolasis not destruction vocabulary) and 2 Ambiguous items (one apocalyptic, one parabolic).
AGAINST: 5+ Plain items stating non-existence directly, plus ~40 E-items using destruction vocabulary at lexical value, plus 1 Plain lexical observation (no destruction word means torment).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
The FOR evidence does not use destruction vocabulary at all -- it uses torment/punishment vocabulary (basanizo, kolasis) from a different word family. The question is what the destruction words mean, and the FOR evidence does not address destruction words. The AGAINST evidence addresses destruction words directly: lexical definitions, usage patterns, explicit non-existence statements. The plain passages (lexical definitions, explicit non-existence language) govern the ambiguous ones (apocalyptic imagery, parabolic depictions).

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
The FOR evidence uses different vocabulary (torment/punishment words) to argue about what destruction words mean. The AGAINST evidence includes the lexical definitions themselves, non-metaphorical usage (wineskins), and explicit non-existence statements ("shall not be," "be no more," "as though they had not been"). Destruction vocabulary means destruction. Master I036 *NEW*.

### I-B Resolution: I3 -- "Everlasting Destruction" Means Ongoing Process

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E126 (Matt 25:46: aionios modifies both outcomes; since life is ongoing, destruction should be ongoing)
- AGAINST: E259 (olethros = "ruin, death" -- a result), E221 (Psa 92:7: "destroyed for ever"), E228 (Job 20:7: "perish for ever"), E202 (Jude 1:7: "eternal fire" applied to Sodom -- not still burning)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E126 (Matt 25:46) | Contextually Clear | Uses kolasis (punishment), not olethros (destruction). The aionios-modifying-noun pattern is observable, but what the modified noun means is the question. |
| E259 (olethros definition) | Plain | Lexical fact. olethros = ruin, death, destruction. |
| E221 (Psa 92:7) | Plain | "Destroyed for ever" -- Hebrew parallel to olethros aionios. shamad = destroyed. The result is permanent. |
| E228 (Job 20:7) | Plain | "Perish for ever" -- same pattern. abad = perish. Permanent perishing. |
| E202 (Jude 1:7) | Plain | "Eternal fire" applied to Sodom. The cities no longer burn. The destruction was completed; its result is eternal. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 1 Contextually Clear item.
AGAINST: 4 Plain items (lexical definition, two OT parallels showing the pattern, one biblical example proving the result-oriented reading).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Jude 1:7 provides a biblical example of aionios + destruction language: Sodom suffered "the vengeance of eternal fire," yet the cities are not still burning. This demonstrates the result-oriented reading: the fire's effect is permanent, not the fire's process. "Everlasting destruction" follows the same pattern: the destruction's result is permanent. "Destroyed for ever" (Psa 92:7) and "perish for ever" (Job 20:7) provide Hebrew precedent for this reading.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
The biblical example of Jude 1:7 (Sodom's "eternal fire" produced a completed, permanent result) governs the reading of 2 Thess 1:9 (everlasting destruction = destruction whose result is permanent). The Hebrew precedent (Psa 92:7; Job 20:7) confirms this pattern. Master I037 *NEW*.

### I-B Resolution: I4 -- "Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth" = Eternal Conscious Torment

**Step 1 -- Tension:**
- FOR: E251 (Matt 13:42: wailing and gnashing in furnace)
- AGAINST: E028 (Matt 10:28: apollymi/destroy in gehenna), E233 (Matt 7:13: apoleia/destruction), E217 (Psa 37:20: consume into smoke), E245 (Mal 4:1: stubble burned up)

**Step 2 -- Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E251 (Matt 13:42) | Ambiguous | Parabolic genre (parable of the tares). "Wailing and gnashing" could describe the moment of being cast in, not an ongoing state. The text does not specify duration. |
| E028 (Matt 10:28) | Plain | Same author (Matthew). Direct teaching: God destroys (apollymi) soul and body in gehenna. |
| E233 (Matt 7:13) | Plain | Same author (Matthew). Direct teaching: the way leads to destruction (apoleia). |
| E217 (Psa 37:20) | Plain | Direct statement: consume into smoke. |
| E245 (Mal 4:1) | Plain | Direct statement: stubble burned up, nothing remains. |

**Step 3 -- Weight:**
FOR: 1 Ambiguous item (parabolic genre, unspecified duration).
AGAINST: 4 Plain items (2 from the same author, Matthew, using destruction vocabulary).

**Step 4 -- SIS Application:**
Matthew 10:28 (destroy soul and body) and 7:13 (destruction) are didactic teaching by Jesus recorded by the same author (Matthew). Matthew 13:42 is a parable. Didactic teaching > parabolic imagery in the clarity hierarchy. The same-author didactic statements (destroy, destruction) govern the reading of the same-author parabolic image (wailing in furnace). The wailing occurs at the moment of destruction, not as an ongoing state.

**Step 5 -- Resolution: Strong**
2 same-author Plain didactic items (Matt 10:28; 7:13) on the AGAINST side vs. 1 Ambiguous parabolic item on the FOR side. The didactic governs the parabolic. Master I038 *NEW*.

### Verification Phase

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
- Each E-item directly quotes or closely paraphrases Scripture, or states an observable linguistic/textual fact. Checked.
- Each uses plain lexical meaning without adding concepts. Checked.
- E-items state what the text says, not what a position infers. Checked.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items.**
- All items classified Conditionalist have full Tree 3 documentation.
- 7 items classified Conditionalist were documented in prior studies with all four gates passed (E028, E075, E148, E090, E087, E088, E095).
- 30 new Conditionalist items have full Tree 3 documentation above with all four gates passed.
- No E-items classified as ECT.
- All Neutral E-items are textual observations both sides accept.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
- Each N-item follows unavoidably from cited E-items. Checked.
- Three N-tier tests applied to each. All pass (documented above).
- All N-items are Neutral because both sides accept the textual observations; they disagree about interpretation.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
- I1 (destruction = cessation): All components in E/N tables -> text-derived -> systematizing only -> I-A. Checked.
- I2 (destruction = metaphorical ruin): E/N items on both sides -> text-derived -> I-B. Checked.
- I3 (everlasting destruction = ongoing process): E/N items on both sides -> text-derived -> I-B. Checked.
- I4 (wailing = eternal torment): E/N items on both sides -> text-derived -> I-B. Checked.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
- I1: Uses only E/N vocabulary and concepts -> aligns -> I-A. Checked.
- I2: Requires destruction words to mean "spiritual ruin" (other than lexical value) -> conflicts -> I-B. Checked.
- I3: Requires olethros to mean "ongoing process" (other than lexical value of "ruin") -> conflicts -> I-B. Checked.
- I4: Requires parabolic image to override didactic teaching -> conflicts -> I-B. Checked.

**Step E: Consistency checks.**
- I-A (I1): Only requires criterion #5 (systematizing) and #4a (SIS). Confirmed.
- I-B (I2, I3, I4): All have E/N items on BOTH sides. Confirmed.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
- abad -> apollymi (LXX 141x): verified textual connection (#4a). Checked.
- shamad -> apollymi (LXX 23x): verified textual connection (#4a). Checked.
- Jude 1:7 (eternal fire + Sodom = completed destruction): self-interpreting biblical example (#4a). Checked.
- Matt 10:28 + Matt 7:13 governing Matt 13:42: same-author passages (#4a). Checked.
- Rev 14:10-11 used to define destruction vocabulary: no verified connection between torment words and destruction words (#4b, inference trigger). Checked.

|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| 2026-02-20 | etc-06 | E212-E267, N027-N030, I036-I039 | Destruction Vocabulary study (74 new items: 56 new E, 4 new N, 4 new I; plus 10 E-items from prior studies referenced by master ID). Covers complete lexical analysis of seven destruction words: abad (H6, 184x), shamad (H8045, 90x), kalah (H3615, 206x), shachath (H7843, 147x), apollymi (G622, 92x), apoleia (G684, 20x), olethros (G3639, 4x). LXX translation patterns verified: abad->apollymi 141x, shamad->apollymi 23x, kalah->synteleo 85x, shachath->diaphtheiro 48x. Perish-vs-life contrast pattern documented across 5+ authors. Destruction similes analyzed (10 types). Three I-B items resolved Strong toward Conditionalist reading: destruction vocabulary means destruction (not metaphorical ruin), "everlasting destruction" means permanent result (not ongoing process), "wailing and gnashing" describes moment of destruction (not eternal state). Updated "Also In" for E028, E075, E087, E088, E090, E095, E126, E148, E202. |

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture Explicitly States or Necessarily Implies)

1. The Bible's primary vocabulary for describing the fate of the wicked consists of destruction/cessation words. Four Hebrew words (abad, shamad, kalah, shachath) totaling approximately 627 occurrences and three Greek words (apollymi, apoleia, olethros) totaling approximately 116 occurrences form the destruction vocabulary. No lexicon defines any of these words as "torment" or "ongoing conscious suffering."

2. The LXX establishes verified cross-testament vocabulary continuity. Pre-Christian Jewish translators mapped abad to apollymi 141 times, shamad to apollymi 23 times, shachath to diaphtheiro 48 times, and kalah to synteleo 85 times. When the NT uses apollymi for the fate of the wicked, it uses the same word the LXX uses for the OT's primary destruction verb.

3. The "perish vs. life" contrast appears across multiple authors: John 3:16 (perish vs. everlasting life), Matt 7:13-14 (destruction vs. life), Rom 6:23 (death vs. eternal life), Phil 3:19 (destruction vs. glorified body), Psa 145:20 (destroy vs. preserve). The two outcomes are presented as antithetical in each case.

4. All biblical destruction similes depict substances that cease to exist: chaff burned (Psa 1:4; Matt 3:12), wax melting (Psa 68:2), smoke dissipating (Psa 37:20; Hos 13:3), fat consumed (Psa 37:20), stubble burned up (Mal 4:1; Nah 1:10), ashes (Mal 4:3), morning clouds/early dew passing away (Hos 13:3), moth-eaten garments (Isa 50:9), thorns burned (Isa 33:12). Not one simile depicts a substance that endures indefinitely.

5. Three passages explicitly state the result of destruction as non-existence: "the wicked shall not be" (Psa 37:10), "consume them, that they may not be" (Psa 59:13), "let the wicked be no more" (Psa 104:35), "as though they had not been" (Oba 1:16).

6. "Everlasting destruction" (olethros aionios, 2 Thess 1:9) combines "everlasting" with a word meaning "ruin, death." The OT parallels "destroyed for ever" (Psa 92:7) and "perish for ever" (Job 20:7) use the same pattern. Jude 1:7 demonstrates that "eternal fire" applied to Sodom describes a completed destruction whose result is permanent, not an ongoing process.

7. The destruction vocabulary and the torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos, kolasis) are distinct word families with different semantic ranges. The Bible uses destruction vocabulary far more frequently than torment vocabulary when describing the fate of the wicked (approximately 30:1 ratio).

8. The destruction vocabulary is used by virtually every biblical author who addresses the fate of the wicked: Moses, David, Asaph, other psalmists, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Malachi, Nahum, Obadiah, Jesus, Paul, Peter, James, Jude, and the Hebrews author.

## What CANNOT Be Said (Not Explicitly Stated or Necessarily Implied by Scripture)

1. **It cannot be said that destruction vocabulary means "ongoing conscious torment."** No lexicon defines abad, shamad, kalah, shachath, apollymi, apoleia, or olethros as "torment" or "ongoing suffering." The ECT reading of these words as "spiritual ruin" (continued existence in a ruined state) requires adding a meaning the text does not contain.

2. **It cannot be said that the destruction similes depict ongoing existence.** Chaff, wax, smoke, stubble, ashes, morning clouds, and dew are all substances that cease to exist through natural processes. Reading these similes as depicting ongoing existence requires them to mean the opposite of what the natural processes illustrate.

3. **It cannot be said that "everlasting destruction" means an ongoing process of being destroyed.** Olethros means "ruin/death" (a result, not a process). The biblical example of "eternal fire" applied to Sodom (Jude 1:7) demonstrates the result-oriented reading: the destruction is completed; its effect is permanent.

4. **It cannot be said that torment vocabulary defines what destruction vocabulary means.** Basanizo (torment) and apollymi (destroy) are different words with different meanings. Using Rev 14:10-11 (basanizo, in apocalyptic genre) to define the meaning of apollymi (used in didactic passages across both testaments) requires an unverified cross-reference (#4b) between different word families.

5. **It cannot be said that "wailing and gnashing of teeth" in a furnace proves eternal conscious torment.** The furnace passages are parabolic (Matt 13:42,50), and the same author (Matthew) uses destruction vocabulary (apollymi, apoleia) in didactic teaching about the same topic (Matt 10:28; 7:13). Didactic teaching governs parabolic imagery in the clarity hierarchy.

6. **It cannot be said that the destruction vocabulary is insignificant or merely metaphorical.** Approximately 743 occurrences of destruction vocabulary across both testaments from virtually every biblical author constitute the Bible's dominant vocabulary for describing what happens to the wicked. This is not a marginal vocabulary set that can be overridden by a few passages from a single genre (apocalyptic).

## Conclusion

This study examined 66 explicit statements, 4 necessary implications, and 4 inferences regarding the Bible's destruction vocabulary for the fate of the wicked.

37 explicit statements are classified Conditionalist: each uses destruction/cessation vocabulary (abad, shamad, kalah, apollymi, apoleia, olethros, or non-existence language) applied to the wicked, with all four Tree 3 gates passed. 0 explicit statements are classified ECT. 29 explicit statements are classified Neutral (lexical definitions, LXX translation data, vocabulary observations, and passages whose positional direction both sides accept as textual fact).

4 necessary implications are classified Neutral: the abad-apollymi lexical chain, the perish-vs-life contrast pattern, the destruction similes' natural properties, and the distinction between destruction and torment word families. These are observable patterns that both sides acknowledge.

1 inference (I-A) systematizes the destruction vocabulary into a comprehensive claim of cessation. 3 inferences (I-B) present ECT-direction claims: that destruction vocabulary is metaphorical, that "everlasting destruction" is an ongoing process, and that "wailing and gnashing" depicts eternal torment. All three were resolved Strong toward the Conditionalist reading: lexical definitions, biblical examples (Jude 1:7), and same-author didactic teaching govern the readings of metaphorical, processual, and parabolic interpretations.
