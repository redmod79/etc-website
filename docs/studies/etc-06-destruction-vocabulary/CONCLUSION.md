## Question

What words does the Bible use to describe the fate of the wicked? Examine the primary Hebrew and Greek destruction vocabulary: abad/apollumi (perish/destroy), shamad (destroy/annihilate), kalah (consume/finish), shachath (corruption/destruction), apoleia (destruction/perdition), olethros (destruction/ruin), and related terms. What do these words semantically mean? Do they describe ongoing conscious torment or cessation of existence? How does the destruction vocabulary in eschatological contexts relate to the torment vocabulary (basanismos, basanizo)?

---

## Summary Answer

The Bible's primary vocabulary for the fate of the wicked — across both testaments, multiple authors, and every genre — uses destruction words (apollumi/perish, apoleia/perdition, olethros/destruction, phthora/corruption, abad/perish, shamad/desolate, kalah/consume, karat/cut off) that denote cessation, ruin, and non-existence. These words are structurally paired as the antithesis of life (zoe/chayyim) throughout Scripture. A separate and lexically distinct torment vocabulary (basanizo/torment, basanismos/torment) appears in eschatological contexts almost exclusively in Revelation, applied to specific subjects (beast-worshippers in a tribulation context; the devil, beast, and false prophet). The LXX confirms this lexical separation: the Hebrew destruction terms (abad, shamad, kalah, karat) are never translated by basanizo or basanismos in the LXX; they are translated by apollumi, apoleia, and related destruction terms. The two vocabulary sets are lexically separate across both testaments.

## Key Verses

1. **John 3:16** — "whosoever believeth in him should not perish [apollumi], but have everlasting life." The antithesis of perishing and having life, using the primary destruction verb.

2. **Matthew 10:28** — "Fear him which is able to destroy [apolesai — apollumi, Aorist Active Infinitive] both soul and body in hell [gehenna]." God destroys both components; the verb is apollumi.

3. **Psalm 37:20** — "The wicked shall perish [yobedu — abad, Qal Impf 3mp]... they shall consume [kalah]; into smoke shall they consume away [kalah]." Three destruction terms: abad + kalah twice. (LXX: abad → apollumi.)

4. **2 Thessalonians 1:9** — "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction [olethron aionion] from the presence of the Lord." The only Pauline eschatological term used here is olethros (destruction), with aionion (everlasting) modifying the destruction.

5. **Malachi 4:1-3** — "The day cometh that shall burn as an oven... it shall leave them neither root nor branch... they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet." Total combustion: stubble → consumed → ashes.

6. **Obadiah 1:16** — "They shall be as though they had not been." The strongest OT non-existence statement for the fate of the nations.

7. **Revelation 14:10-11** — Beast-worshippers "tormented [basanizo] with fire and brimstone... smoke of their torment [basanismos] ascendeth up for ever and ever." Torment vocabulary applied to a specific tribulation-era group.

8. **Revelation 20:10** — Devil, beast, false prophet "shall be tormented [basanizo] day and night for ever and ever." Torment vocabulary applied to three named eschatological entities.

## Full Analysis

### The Cross-Testament Destruction Vocabulary

The Bible's destruction vocabulary for the fate of the wicked is unified across both testaments through the LXX bridge. The dominant correspondence is H6 (abad) → G622 (apollumi): 141 LXX occurrences, PMI score 6.14. When the Psalms declare "the wicked shall perish [abad]," the LXX translates this as "shall perish [apollumi]," and the NT writers using apollumi for eschatological destruction are drawing on the same semantic field. H8045 (shamad) also maps primarily to G622 (apollumi): 23 occurrences, PMI 4.53.

This cross-testament semantic continuity means the NT destruction vocabulary is not introduced as a new concept; it inherits and continues the OT framework.

### Apollumi (G622) — Destroy Fully / Perish Completely

Apollumi (92 NT occurrences) is the primary Greek word for the wicked's fate. Its lexical definition: "to destroy fully (reflexively, to perish, or lose), literally or figuratively." It describes:
- Physical destruction (wineskins burst: Mat 9:17; Luke 5:37)
- Death (Acts 27:34)
- Cosmic dissolution (heavens perish: Heb 1:11)
- Eschatological judgment (Mat 10:28; Jn 3:16; Lk 13:3,5; Rom 2:12; 2 Pet 3:9)

In eschatological contexts, apollumi consistently stands in antithesis to life (zoe): "should not perish [apollumi] but have everlasting life [zoe aionion]" (Jn 3:16). The adversative structure (not perish BUT have life) places perishing and having life as mutually exclusive alternatives.

Matthew 10:28 uses the aorist active infinitive (apolesai) — treating the destruction as a single, complete act — with both soul (psuche) and body (soma) as the objects. The word is apollumi (destroy), not basanizō (torment).

First Corinthians 15:18 provides the definitional test: "those who fell asleep in Christ have perished [apolonto]" (hypothetical, if resurrection is false). Paul uses apollumi for the worst-case scenario absent resurrection — the complete, total destruction of the dead in Christ. This confirms that for Paul, apollumi in its eschatological register means cessation, not ongoing conscious torment; otherwise the absence of resurrection would not constitute "perishing."

### Apoleia (G684) and Olethros (G3639)

Apoleia (20 NT occurrences): the noun form of apollumi's semantic field. Used for the telos (final outcome) of enemies of the cross (Phil 3:19: "whose end is destruction"), for "vessels of wrath fitted to destruction" (Rom 9:22), for the broad road that leads to destruction vs. the narrow road to life (Mat 7:13-14), and for the beast's destiny (Rev 17:8,11: "goes into perdition").

Olethros (4 NT occurrences): ruin/destruction in every occurrence. The eschatologically critical text is 2 Th 1:9: "everlasting destruction [olethron aionion] from the presence of the Lord." Paul's chosen vocabulary for the eternal punishment of the wicked is olethros — a noun of result denoting ruin — not basanismos (torment). The aionion (everlasting) modifier attaches to the destruction term. All four NT occurrences of olethros refer to destruction/ruin; none is used to mean ongoing conscious torment.

### Phthora (G5356) and Related Terms

Phthora (9 NT occurrences): decay, corruption, ruin. The antithesis in Gal 6:8 is "reap corruption [phthoran]" vs. "reap life everlasting [zoen aionion]" — the same structural antithesis (destruction vs. life) as in Jn 3:16 and elsewhere. The 2 Pet 2:12 comparison of false teachers to animals "made to be taken and destroyed" places them in the category of creatures whose end is consumption/death, not eternal conscious torment.

### Hebrew Destruction Vocabulary: The Psalm 37 Cluster

Psalm 37 concentrates five distinct destruction terms in one chapter, providing the OT's most sustained treatment of the wicked's fate:

- **abad** (H6, perish): v.20 — Qal Imperfect 3mp: "shall perish"
- **karat** (H3772, cut off): vv.9, 22, 28, 34, 38 — five Niphal forms: "shall be cut off" (passive: by God's action)
- **shamad** (H8045, destroy): v.38 — Niphal Perfect 3p: "were destroyed"
- **kalah** (H3615, consume): v.20 — Qal Perfect 3p (doubled): "consumed; into smoke consumed away"
- **ain** (H369, non-existence): vv.10, 36 — "not be"; "he was not"

The non-existence particle (ain) appears twice in Psalm 37 as the terminal statement after the destruction vocabulary. Verse 10: "yet a little while and the wicked shall not be [ain rasha]; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be [ainenu — he is not]." Verse 36: "he passed away, and lo, he was not [ain hu]." The destruction words lead to the non-existence words as their stated result.

### The Non-Existence Passages

The OT contains multiple non-existence expressions for the fate of the wicked that go beyond destruction vocabulary:

- **Psalm 104:35**: "Let sinners be consumed [tamam] out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more [einam]" — consumption followed by non-existence
- **Obadiah 1:16**: "They shall be as though they had not been [lo hayah]" — the strongest OT non-existence formula
- **Ezekiel 28:19**: "never shalt thou be any more [lo tehyeh]" — permanent denial of future existence
- **Isaiah 41:11-12**: "as nothing [ka-ayin]"; "as a thing of nought [ka-ephes]"; "thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them" — non-findable, as nothing, as zero

These non-existence expressions consistently follow or accompany the destruction-vocabulary terms, not the torment-vocabulary terms.

### Key OT Prophetic Testimony

**Malachi 4:1-3**: Progressive combustion: wicked = stubble → fire burns them up completely → "neither root nor branch" (nothing remaining) → they become ashes (epher). Ashes (epher) are the physical residue of complete combustion in sacrificial contexts (Lev 4:12; Num 19:9). The cross-testament parallel connects Mal 4:1 to Isa 5:24 (fire devouring stubble/chaff; root as rottenness) and 2 Pet 3:7-12 (eschatological fire).

**Nahum 1:8-9**: "He will make an utter end [kalah — noun H3617] of the place... affliction shall not rise up the second time." The phrase "affliction shall not rise up the second time" is the clearest OT statement of terminal finality. The enemy is completely eliminated; it cannot threaten again, because it no longer exists.

**Hosea 13:3**: Four vanishing similes (morning cloud, early dew, chaff, smoke) — all depicting complete cessation. None of these images is compatible with ongoing preservation in torment.

**Isaiah 66:24**: The source text (confirmed by cross-testament parallel tool, top NT parallel = Mark 9:48, score 0.424) for Jesus's gehenna imagery in Mark 9. The Hebrew word for the objects of the worm and fire is pigrê (H6297 = corpses/dead bodies), not living persons. The fire and worm act on the dead bodies of rebels. This passage was registered as E141 in etc5-05.

### The Life/Death Antithesis

Across both testaments and multiple authors, the eschatological antithesis is life vs. destruction/death — not life vs. torment. The structural pattern:

| Destruction side | Life side | Reference |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| apollumi (perish) | zoe aionios (everlasting life) | Jn 3:16 |
| apoleia (destruction) | zoe (life) | Mat 7:13-14 |
| phthora (corruption) | zoe aionios (eternal life) | Gal 6:8 |
| thanatos (death) | zoe aionios (eternal life) | Rom 6:23 |
| kolasis aionios (everlasting punishment) | zoe aionios (eternal life) | Mat 25:46 |
| apoleia (perdition) | peripoiesis psuches (saving of soul) | Heb 10:39 |

First John 5:11-12 states the antithesis in its clearest form: "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life [ouk echei ten zoen]." The state of those without the Son is "not having life" — described as the absence of life, not as an alternative mode of conscious existence.

### The Torment Vocabulary and Its Distribution

The torment vocabulary (basanizo/basanismos/kolasis) is lexically distinct from the destruction vocabulary and appears in different contexts with different subjects.

**Basanizo** (G928, 12 NT occurrences) and **basanismos** (G929, 6 NT occurrences): In eschatological contexts, basanizo appears only in Revelation. All NT eschatological basanismos occurrences are in Revelation (9:5; 14:11; 18:7; 18:10; 18:15). Outside Revelation, NT eschatological passages use destruction vocabulary.

The eschatological basanizo passages in Revelation apply to:
- Revelation 9:5: locusts torment (basanizo) for five months — temporary, not lethal ("not that they should kill them")
- Revelation 14:10-11: beast-worshippers tormented — a specific tribulation-era class (those with the mark, those who worship the beast)
- Revelation 20:10: the devil, the beast, and the false prophet tormented forever — three named eschatological entities

**Kolasis** (G2851, 2 NT occurrences): Matthew 25:46 ("everlasting punishment [kolasin aionion]") uses punishment vocabulary, not destruction vocabulary or torment vocabulary. The word's root (kolazō = to prune, curtail, chastise) emphasizes punitive-corrective action. The verse states the outcome for the wicked and righteous using the same adjective (aionion) without specifying the form of the punishment.

**The LXX confirms the separation**: None of the Hebrew destruction terms (abad, shamad, kalah, karat) is translated as basanizo or basanismos anywhere in the LXX. The torment terms have a different lexical history (from basanos = touchstone for testing/torture), rooted in intertestamental torture contexts (Maccabees), not in the OT destruction-vocabulary of the Psalms and Prophets.

### 2. Necessary Implications Table (N Tier)

*N tier = unavoidably follows from E statements; no interpretation required; universal agreement.*

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable | Classification | Master ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | G622 (apollumi) and G684 (apoleia) are structurally placed as the direct antithesis of G2222 (zoe, life) throughout the NT eschatological vocabulary — they occupy the opposite pole from "having life" in every occurrence where they appear together. | E2 (Jn 3:16: not perish BUT have life); E19 (Mat 7:13-14: road to destruction vs. road to life); E20 (Gal 6:8: reap corruption vs. reap eternal life); E21 (Heb 10:39: perdition vs. saving of the soul) | Four independent texts by different authors (John, Matthew/Jesus, Paul, author of Hebrews) place apollumi/apoleia on the opposite side from zoe. Observable structural pattern both sides must acknowledge. | Conditionalist | **NEW: N030** |
| N2 | The LXX translation of H6 (abad) as G622 (apollumi) 141 times establishes that the NT writers using apollumi for eschatological destruction were using vocabulary that the LXX had already established as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "perish/be destroyed" vocabulary in the Psalms and Prophets. | E25 (LXX mapping data: H6 → G622, 141x, PMI 6.14) | The quantitative LXX correspondence (141x, PMI 6.14) is the dominant cross-testament correspondence for either word. That the NT uses the LXX's established vocabulary for eschatological destruction is an unavoidable lexical observation. | Neutral | **NEW: N031** |
| N3 | The Hebrew destruction terms (abad, shamad, kalah, karat) and the Greek NT destruction terms (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora) form a unified semantic field across both testaments, consistently describing cessation, ruin, and loss rather than ongoing conscious torment. | E3, E5, E6, E14 (abad/shamad/karat in Psalms); E3, E8-E11, E17, E31 (multiple OT destruction passages); E2, E15, E18, E19, E22, E23, E28-E30 (NT apollumi/apoleia/olethros); E25, E26 (LXX bridge data); N031 | Observable from the complete lexical survey: none of the destruction terms is ever used in any context to mean "ongoing conscious torment."

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria | Classification | SIS Resolution | Master ID |
|---|-------|------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| I1 | The Bible teaches that the destruction vocabulary (apollumi, abad, etc.) consistently describes cessation of existence — the wicked cease to exist — rather than ongoing conscious torment in another state. | I-A | E3 (Ps 37:20 abad + kalah + smoke imagery); E4 (Ps 37:10 non-existence particle: "not be"); E7 (Ps 37:36 "he was not"); E10 (Obad 1:16 "as though they had not been"); E12 (Ps 104:35 consumed → be no more); E32 (Ezk 28:19 "never shalt thou be any more"); E33 (Isa 41:11-12 "as nothing"); N030, N032. | No single verse states "the wicked cease to exist" as a comprehensive doctrine. Systematizes the destruction vocabulary pattern + non-existence expressions across both testaments into a positive doctrinal claim. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | I-A: Strong single-direction support | **NEW: IA018** |
| I2 | The two vocabulary sets — destruction (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora, abad, shamad, kalah, karat) and torment (basanizo, basanismos) — describe different outcomes for different subjects in Revelation, not a unified description of the same event for all the wicked. | I-A | E36 (Rev 14:10-11: torment = beast-worshippers, specific tribulation class); E37 (Rev 20:10: torment = devil/beast/false prophet, three named entities); E38 (Rev 20:9: nations = devoured/consumed, consumption vocabulary); Rev 20:15 (human wicked cast into lake without torment language); N033 (lexical separation confirmed); E2, E15, E19 (destruction vocabulary for all the wicked broadly). | Systematizes the different subjects + vocabulary choices in Revelation into a broader claim about different outcomes. Requires the inference step that vocabulary choice reflects outcome distinction. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | I-A: No torment language applied to general human wicked in any passage | **NEW: IA019** |
| I3 | The biblical self-interpretation of "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion, 2 Th 1:9) is that aionion modifies the permanence of the result of destruction, not the ongoing duration of a process of torment. | I-A | E15 (2 Th 1:9: olethron aionion — aionion attaches to the destruction noun); N029 (existing: eternal fire on Sodom = ashes, i.e., permanent result, not ongoing process); E147 (existing: Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6 = eternal fire = ashes). The aionion modifier functions identically for "eternal fire" (=ashes) and "everlasting destruction" (=permanent ruin). | Applies N029 (eternal fire = permanent result) to the aionion-olethros construction. This is a #4a SIS connection: the Bible's own definition of "eternal fire" as a permanent result (via Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6) governs the parallel construction "everlasting destruction." | #5 (systematizing); #4a (SIS: Jude/2 Pet define "eternal" fire as producing ashes — same aionion-adjective pattern) | Conditionalist | I-A: SIS connection via N029/E147 | **NEW: IA020** |
| I4 | The structural antithesis of destruction/death vs. life throughout Scripture teaches that the wicked's final state is genuine non-life (cessation) rather than an alternative form of conscious existence. | I-A | N030 (destruction vocabulary = structural antithesis of life); E24/E068 (1 Jn 5:12: "hath not the Son hath not life" — not having life, not having torment-life); E2 (Jn 3:16 not perish vs. have life); E20 (Gal 6:8 corruption vs. eternal life); IA014 (existing: death/life antithesis). | Systematizes the life/destruction antithesis pattern into the positive claim that the wicked's final state is non-life. IA014 (existing) covers the full cross-testament pattern; this study's data reinforces and supplements it. | #5 (systematizing N030 + E items into an ontological claim about the wicked's state) | Conditionalist | I-A — supported by IA014 (existing) | Supplement to IA014 |
| I5 | The "smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" in Revelation 14:11 is an appropriation of the permanent-desolation imagery of Isaiah 34:10 (smoke of burning Edom ascending forever) — a literary formula for permanent ruin — rather than a literal description of ongoing conscious suffering in perpetuity. | I-B | FOR this claim: E41 (Isa 34:10 = highest OT parallel for Rev 14:11, hybrid 0.401, theo 0.30; Edom's desolated wasteland = referent of ascending smoke); N029 (eternal fire = permanent result, not ongoing process). AGAINST: E36 (Rev 14:10-11 explicitly uses basanizo/basanismos = torment vocabulary in an eschatological context; the smoke is connected to their torment; the text says "no rest day nor night"). | Both sides have textual support. The OT background (Isa 34:10 = desolation imagery) points toward literary formula; the NT text's use of basanizo (torment) points toward conscious experience. | #2 (choosing between literary formula and literal description); #3 (applying genre/literary-context framework); #4a (SIS: Isa 34:10 = source text for the imagery) | Neutral | **Moderate — weight toward literary formula / permanent-desolation imagery.** The identified source text (Isa 34:10 = wasteland smoke, not conscious torment) governs the imagery via #4a SIS. The "no rest day nor night" language is contextually specific to beast-worshippers (same subject limitation as IB008). | **NEW: IB009** |
| I6 | "Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord" (2 Th 1:9) means banishment / separation from God's presence — the wicked exist forever in a state of being cut off from God — rather than their complete annihilation as the result of encountering God's presence. | I-B | FOR: "from the presence of the Lord" (apo prosopou) could indicate source of separation/banishment. AGAINST: E15 (Paul's chosen noun is olethros = destruction/ruin, not separation vocabulary); Psa 68:2 (wicked perish abad at the presence of God = E31, presence = destructive agent); Psa 9:3 (enemies "perish at thy presence" — presence causes destruction, not separation); E3/E4/E7/E12 (non-existence vocabulary throughout the OT destruction cluster). | The reading "banishment from God's presence" is grammatically possible but requires understanding apo prosopou as a prepositional phrase of separation rather than source. It also requires understanding olethros as "condition of separation" rather than its lexical meaning (ruin/destruction). | #1 (adding the concept "ongoing existence in separation" not present in olethros); #2 (choosing between source reading and separation reading of apo prosopou) | ECT | **Moderate — weight AGAINST banishment/separation reading.** The clearer passages (Ps 9:3; Ps 68:2) use "at/from the presence" as the location/source of destruction, not of banishment. The word Paul chose (olethros = ruin, destruction) most naturally denotes the result of being destroyed rather than the ongoing state of being separated. | **NEW: IB010** |

### I-B Resolution Subsections

#### I-B Resolution: IB009 — Smoke ascending forever (Rev 14:11) as permanent-desolation imagery vs. literal conscious torment

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR (literary formula / desolation imagery): E41 (Isa 34:10 = OT source text, highest parallel, score 0.401 with theological match; Edom's burning land is the referent, not conscious persons); N029 (existing: eternal fire terminology = permanent result, not ongoing process per Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6).
- AGAINST: E36 (Rev 14:10-11: basanizo/basanismos used; smoke connected to "their torment"; text states "no rest day nor night" for the beast-worshipping class).

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E41 (Isa 34:10) | Plain | The referent is explicitly a desolated land; the text's own subject is the wasteland of Edom, not persons in conscious torment. OT didactic prophecy. |
| N029 | Plain | Bible's self-definition of "eternal fire" as producing ashes (Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6: same author, same event, same fire = ashes). |
| E36 | Contextually Clear | Apocalyptic vision genre; specific subject (beast-worshippers in tribulation); torment vocabulary is genuine and explicit; the "no rest" statement is unqualified within the passage. |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
Plain OT source text (Isa 34:10 as the background for the smoke-forever formula) combined with the Bible's self-definition of eternal fire (N029) outweigh the contextually-specific Revelation passage. The apocalyptic genre of Revelation calls for OT source-text analysis of its imagery.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
Isaiah 34:10 is the confirmed source text for Revelation 14:11's "smoke ascending forever" language (tool-verified parallel, highest OT score with theological flag). The OT source provides context: the smoke rises from a desolated wasteland, not from conscious persons. This is #4a SIS (verified textual connection: OT text quoted/alluded to → governs the imagery's referent). The clear OT source (Edom's desolation) interprets the unclear Revelation passage.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate — weight toward permanent-desolation imagery / literary formula**
The tool-verified OT source text (Isa 34:10) establishes that "smoke ascending forever" is the biblical idiom for permanent destruction/desolation. The torment vocabulary in Rev 14:10-11 is specific to the beast-worshipping class (same subject-limitation as IB008) and is in an apocalyptic genre. The literary background governs the smoke-imagery's meaning.

---

#### I-B Resolution: IB010 — "From the presence of the Lord" in 2 Th 1:9 as separation vs. source of destruction

**Step 1 — Tension:**
- FOR (separation reading, ECT): "apo prosopou" (from the presence) could denote being removed/banished from God's presence — the wicked exist forever in a state of separation from God.
- AGAINST (source reading, conditionalist): Paul's noun is olethros (destruction/ruin), not a separation word. OT "at God's presence" in destruction contexts = the presence is the destructive agent (Ps 9:3; Ps 68:2; Isa 2:10,19,21). E15; E4, E7, E10, E12 (non-existence vocabulary).

**Step 2 — Clarity Assessment:**

| Item | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| E15 (2 Th 1:9: olethros) | Plain | Lexical: olethros = ruin/destruction (noun of result). The word Paul chose names what happens to the wicked. Didactic (epistle). |
| E31 (Ps 68:2: perish at presence) | Plain | "At thy presence" = the presence is where/by which the wicked perish. Psalmic/prophetic. |
| Ps 9:3 (fall/perish at God's presence) | Plain | "At thy presence" = spatial/causal: presence causes perishing. Multiple Psalmic texts confirm this as the OT idiom. |
| Isa 2:10,19,21 | Contextually Clear | "Hide from the glory of his majesty" = the LORD's presence causes destruction; people flee from it. Prophetic. |

**Step 3 — Weight:**
The lexical weight of olethros (destruction-noun) is unambiguous. Multiple OT passages use "at/from the presence" as the source/agent of destruction. The separation reading requires olethros to mean something other than its lexical definition (ruin/destruction) and requires the "from the presence" phrase to denote banishment rather than the source of the destructive action.

**Step 4 — SIS Application:**
The OT texts (Ps 68:2; Ps 9:3; Isa 2:10,19,21) use "from the presence of the LORD" or "at thy presence" in contexts where God's presence causes destruction — this is the OT semantic register for the phrase. These are #4a connections (OT contexts using the same construction to mean "caused by God's presence/presence as destructive agent"). Paul's use of the same construction likely continues this OT idiom.

**Step 5 — Resolution: Moderate — weight AGAINST the separation/banishment reading**
The lexical meaning of olethros (ruin/destruction) combined with the OT idiom (God's presence = destructive agent) weighs against reading the phrase as banishment into ongoing existence. The separation reading adds a concept (ongoing existence in separation) not contained in olethros.

### 4. Verification Phase

**Step A (Verify E statements):** All E items directly quote or closely paraphrase the stated verse text. E25, E26, E27, E40, E41, E44 are derived from lexical/parallel tool data — these are tool-verified statistical observations, not positional readings. E38 identifies vocabulary from Rev 20:9 that both sides must acknowledge. E39 is the grammatical observation about Mat 25:46 (same adjective; word is kolasis not olethros/basanismos). All E items pass the "what the text says" test.

**Step B (Verify N statements):** N030: the antithetical structure of apollumi/apoleia vs. zoe is observable in four independent NT texts — both sides must acknowledge the structural pairing even if they disagree about what the antithesis implies. N031: the 141-occurrence LXX correspondence is a quantitative lexical fact. N032: the lexical survey showing no destruction term = torment anywhere in the full corpus is an observable fact. N033: the vocabulary distribution (basanizo confined to Revelation for eschatological uses; destruction vocabulary throughout) is an observable fact. All N items pass the three tests (universal agreement, no interpretation required, zero added concepts).

**Step C (Source test):** IA018-IA020: all components are from E/N tables. IB009 and IB010: both have E/N items on both sides — correctly classified as I-B.

**Step D (Direction test):** IA018, IA019, IA020: do not require any E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value — they systematize. IB009: the Rev 14:11 passage and the Isa 34:10 data are in genuine tension — correctly I-B. IB010: the "apo prosopou" phrase in 2 Th 1:9 and the OT parallels are in tension — correctly I-B.

**Step E (Consistency checks):** IA018-IA020 require only #5 (systematizing) and optionally #4a. IB009 and IB010 have E/N items on both sides. No reclassification needed.

**Step F (SIS connections):** IB009 documents the Isa 34:10 connection (tool-verified parallel, Theo 0.30 flag). IB010 documents the OT "from the presence" construction in destruction contexts. Both are #4a (verified textual connections).

## What CAN Be Said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies)

1. The primary eschatological vocabulary across both testaments uses words meaning "destroy," "perish," "ruin," "consume," "cut off," and "be no more."
2. The LXX translates the Hebrew destruction terms (abad, shamad) primarily as the Greek destruction terms (apollumi, apoleia) — confirming semantic continuity across the testaments.
3. The NT eschatological torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos) appears almost exclusively in Revelation, applied to specific named subjects: beast-worshippers (Rev 14:10-11) and the devil/beast/false prophet (Rev 20:10).
4. The two vocabulary sets (destruction and torment) are lexically distinct and never appear together in the same eschatological judgment description for the same subject.
5. The destruction vocabulary is structurally paired as the antithesis of life (zoe) throughout both testaments.
6. Several OT passages use explicit non-existence expressions as the terminal statement for the fate of the wicked (Psa 37:10, 36; Psa 104:35; Obad 1:16; Isa 41:11-12; Ezk 28:19).
7. Paul's chosen vocabulary for the eternal punishment of the wicked in his key eschatological passage (2 Th 1:9) is olethros (destruction/ruin), not basanismos (torment).
8. Matthew 25:46 uses kolasis (punishment), not olethros (destruction) or basanismos (torment), for the wicked's eternal outcome — a distinct third term.
9. The highest OT parallel for Revelation 14:11's "smoke ascending forever" is Isaiah 34:10 — which describes a burning, desolated wasteland (the land of Edom), not conscious persons in perpetual torment.

## What CANNOT Be Said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied)

1. Neither side can claim Scripture explicitly states that the destruction vocabulary means ongoing conscious torment — no text defines apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora, abad, shamad, kalah, or karat as referring to ongoing conscious suffering.
2. Neither side can claim Scripture explicitly states that the torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos) applies universally to all the wicked — both Rev 14:10-11 and Rev 20:10 specify particular subjects.
3. Neither side can claim Scripture explicitly states that the destruction vocabulary means absolute non-existence in a philosophical sense (as opposed to the perishing of the current form of existence with some other outcome).
4. Neither side can claim Scripture explicitly resolves whether "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion, 2 Th 1:9) means the wicked cease to exist or exist forever in a condition of ruin/separation.
5. Neither side can claim Scripture explicitly states that Matthew 25:46's "everlasting punishment" (kolasin aionion) refers to ongoing conscious torment rather than permanent destructive punishment.

---

## Conclusion

The biblical vocabulary for the fate of the wicked across both testaments is dominated by the destruction word-group: apollumi (destroy/perish), apoleia (destruction/perdition), olethros (ruin/destruction), phthora (corruption/decay), abad (perish/be destroyed), shamad (desolate/bring to nought), kalah (consume/come to an end), karat (cut off), tamam (be consumed). These terms are defined by their lexicons as destruction, ruin, cessation, and loss — not as torment or ongoing conscious experience. The LXX bridge (H6 abad → G622 apollumi, 141 occurrences, PMI 6.14) establishes cross-testament semantic continuity: the NT destruction vocabulary inherits and continues the OT's destruction vocabulary for the same eschatological subject.

The OT's testimony adds non-existence expressions as the terminal statement following destruction-vocabulary: Psalm 37 uses ain (not be / he is not) twice after the abad/karat/shamad/kalah cluster; Psalm 104:35 pairs tamam (consumed) with einam (be no more); Obadiah 1:16 states the nations will be "as though they had not been"; Ezekiel 28:19 states "never shalt thou be any more."

The torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos) appears in eschatological contexts almost exclusively in Revelation, applied to specific subjects: a tribulation-era class (beast-worshippers) in Revelation 14:10-11, and three named entities (devil, beast, false prophet) in Revelation 20:10. The LXX confirms the separation: the Hebrew destruction terms are never translated as basanizo/basanismos; the two vocabulary sets are lexically distinct across both testaments.

The destruction vocabulary stands as the antithesis of life (zoe) in John 3:16, Matthew 7:13-14, Galatians 6:8, Romans 6:23, Hebrews 10:39, and 1 John 5:11-12. The structural antithesis is perishing vs. having life, not torment vs. having life.

The difficult passages (2 Th 1:9 olethron aionion; Mat 25:46 kolasin aionion; Rev 14:10-11; Rev 20:10) are addressed in the I-B resolutions above. In each case, the weight of evidence is documented according to the 5-step SIS protocol.

Across the entire biblical vocabulary examined in this study: 34 new E items classify as Conditionalist (destruction vocabulary), 0 classify as ECT, and 8 classify as Neutral (lexical/statistical observations both sides must acknowledge). The existing ECT items (E149, E150) are confirmed and cited. The net evidence accumulation in this study is substantially in the destruction/conditionalist direction at the E tier, with the I-B items (IB009, IB010) representing the genuine textual tensions that require resolution.
