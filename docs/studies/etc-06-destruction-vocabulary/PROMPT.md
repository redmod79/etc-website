#### G3639: olethros (destruction)
- **Word:** olethros
- **Transliteration:** olethros
- **Pronunciation:** ol-eth-ros
- **Part of Speech:** masculine noun
- **Definition:** From a primary ollymi (to destroy; a prolonged form); ruin, i.e. death, punishment.
- **Total occurrences:** 4
- **Translation distribution:**
  - "destruction" (3x, 75.0%)
  - "the destruction" (1x, 25.0%)

**All 4 verses using G3639:**
- 1 Cor 5:5 -- "To deliver such an one unto Satan for the DESTRUCTION (olethros) of the flesh"
- 1 Thess 5:3 -- "Then sudden DESTRUCTION (olethros) cometh upon them... and they shall not escape"
- 2 Thess 1:9 -- "Who shall be punished with everlasting DESTRUCTION (olethros) from the presence of the Lord"
- 1 Tim 6:9 -- "Foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in DESTRUCTION (olethros) and perdition (apoleia)"

**Key finding:** All four uses of olethros involve destruction/ruin. The critical eschatological verse is 2 Thess 1:9 -- "everlasting DESTRUCTION (olethros)" -- the phrase combines aionios (everlasting) with olethros (destruction/ruin). Note: olethros is etymologically related to apollymi (G622).

### Focus Areas
(Derived from tool discoveries and prior study findings)

1. **abad (H6) and apollymi (G622) -- The primary destruction word pair:** The LXX translates abad as apollymi 141 times, establishing them as the premier Hebrew-Greek equivalents for "perish/destroy." Together they occur over 300 times. How are these words used in eschatological contexts? Are they EVER used to mean "ongoing torment" or do they consistently mean "cease to exist / be destroyed"? Prior study etc-05 already noted that apollymi is Jesus' chosen word for what happens in gehenna (Matt 10:28; Matt 5:29-30). This study conducts the comprehensive lexical analysis.

2. **shamad (H8045) -- Total destruction/annihilation:** Used ~100 times. Means to desolate, exterminate, bring to nought. The LXX translates it as apollymi 23 times and exairo (to remove completely) 12 times. How does shamad function in eschatological contexts? Key verse: Psa 145:20 -- "all the wicked will he destroy (shamad)."

3. **kalah (H3615) -- Consume/complete/finish:** A word with dual meaning (complete a task / consume a substance). When used of people, means to consume, spend up, use up. Key verse: Psa 37:20 -- "into smoke shall they consume away (kalah)." What does the consumption metaphor imply about the nature of divine judgment?

4. **shachath (H7843) -- Corrupt/decay/ruin:** The broadest of the Hebrew terms. Includes both physical destruction and moral corruption. The LXX translates it as diaphtheiro (to rot thoroughly, 48 times). Note connection to diaphthora (G1312, corruption) used in Acts 2:27,31 and Acts 13:34-37 for grave-corruption. How does the decay/corruption meaning relate to the fate of the wicked?

5. **apoleia (G684) -- Destruction/perdition:** The noun form of apollymi (G622). Used 17-20 times in the NT. KJV translates it as "perdition" (5x) and "destruction" (4x). Key verse: Matt 7:13 -- "broad is the way that leadeth to destruction (apoleia)." How does this word function in contrast to "life" (zoe)?

6. **olethros (G3639) -- Destruction/ruin:** Only 4 NT occurrences. The critical verse is 2 Thess 1:9 -- "everlasting destruction (olethros) from the presence of the Lord." This is the ONLY verse pairing aionios (everlasting) with olethros (destruction). How does the ECT interpretation handle "everlasting destruction" when olethros means "ruin/destruction"? How does the conditionalist interpretation handle "everlasting" modifying a destruction word?

7. **The abad-apollymi-apoleia lexical chain:** H6 (abad) -> G622 (apollymi, via LXX) -> G684 (apoleia, noun form). This forms a single lexical chain from the OT through the LXX to the NT. The semantic field is consistent: perish, destroy, destruction, ruin, loss. Does this chain support the idea that the fate of the wicked is destruction (cessation) or does it support ongoing torment?

8. **Destruction vocabulary vs. torment vocabulary in eschatological contexts:** Prior study etc-05 found that gehenna passages use apollymi (destroy), not basanizo (torment). This study examines ALL six destruction words in eschatological contexts to determine whether the Bible's primary vocabulary for the fate of the wicked is destruction-language or torment-language.

9. **The "everlasting" + destruction word combinations:** Several key verses combine aionios/olam with destruction words: "everlasting destruction" (2 Thess 1:9), "destroyed for ever" (Psa 92:7), "perish from the way" (Psa 2:12). How do these combinations function? Does "everlasting destruction" mean "destruction that lasts forever" (ECT: ongoing process) or "destruction whose result is everlasting" (Conditionalist: permanent cessation)?

10. **Destruction similes -- what do the images depict?** Scripture compares the fate of the wicked to: chaff burned (Psa 1:4; Matt 3:12), wax melting (Psa 68:2), smoke dissipating (Psa 37:20; Hos 13:3), stubble consumed (Mal 4:1; Nah 1:10), ashes under feet (Mal 4:3), morning clouds passing away (Hos 13:3). Do these similes depict an ongoing process or a completed result?

1. What is the combined semantic range of all six destruction words? Do they share a common meaning (cessation of existence) or do they span a range that includes ongoing torment?
2. How does the LXX translation pattern (abad -> apollymi 141x, shamad -> apollymi 23x, shachath -> diaphtheiro 48x) establish cross-testament vocabulary continuity?
3. In how many eschatological uses does abad/apollymi mean "ongoing conscious torment" vs. "perish/be destroyed"? (Compare: wineskins "perish" in Matt 9:17 -- they cease to function, not tormented)
4. How does the abad-apollymi-apoleia chain function in the life/destruction contrast pattern? (John 3:16: perish vs. everlasting life; Matt 7:13-14: destruction vs. life; Phil 3:19: destruction vs. citizenship in heaven)
5. What does "everlasting destruction" (olethros aionios, 2 Thess 1:9) mean lexically? Does olethros anywhere mean "ongoing torment"?
6. How do the destruction similes (chaff, wax, smoke, stubble, ashes, morning clouds) depict the fate of the wicked? Do ANY of these images depict ongoing existence?
7. How do destruction vocabulary passages relate to the torment vocabulary passages (basanizo/basanismos in Rev 14:10-11; 20:10)? Are these describing the same event in different terms, or different events?
8. Does any Hebrew destruction word (abad, shamad, kalah, shachath) EVER mean "torment" or "ongoing conscious existence in suffering" in any OT passage?
9. What is the significance of Psa 37:20 using BOTH abad (perish) and kalah (consume into smoke) in one verse? What about Isa 26:14 using BOTH abad and shamad?
10. How does the observation that gehenna uses apollymi (Matt 10:28) but NOT basanizo (established in etc-05, E197) connect to the broader pattern of destruction vocabulary?

### INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY
```
INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:
- You are an investigator, not an advocate. Your job is to report what the evidence says.
- Gather evidence from ALL sides. If a passage is cited by ECT proponents, examine it honestly. If a passage is cited by conditionalists, examine it honestly.
- Do NOT assume your conclusion before examining the evidence.
- Do NOT state opinions. State what the text says. Do not use editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," "honestly acknowledge," or "non-intuitive reading." Simply state what each passage says and what each side infers from it.
- When presenting findings, state: "The text says X" (explicit). Then state: "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- Never use language like "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- The conclusion should emerge FROM the evidence, not be imposed ON it.
```

### Evidence Classification Requirements
Follow the full methodology in `D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-series-methodology.md`:
- Trees 1-5 for classification
- Tree 3 for every E-item classified as Conditionalist or ECT (full 4-gate documentation)
- N-tier 3-question test for every N-item
- I-B resolution protocol for every I-B inference
- Read and update `D:/Bible/bible-studies/etc-master-evidence.md` before writing tally
- What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said sections

### Critical Notes for This Study
1. **The life/destruction contrast is THE central pattern.** John 3:16 (perish vs. everlasting life), Matt 7:13-14 (destruction vs. life), Rom 6:23 (death vs. eternal life), Phil 3:19 (destruction vs. citizenship in heaven). Track this contrast through ALL six destruction words.

2. **Do not conflate destruction vocabulary with torment vocabulary.** Apollymi (destroy) and basanizo (torment) are different Greek words with different meanings. The question is which vocabulary the Bible predominantly uses for the fate of the wicked.

3. **The LXX connections are primary evidence.** When the OT uses abad (perish) and the LXX translates it as apollymi (destroy), and the NT uses apollymi for the fate of the wicked, this is a verified textual connection (#4a SIS).

4. **"Everlasting" modifies the NOUN it modifies.** "Everlasting destruction" (2 Thess 1:9) -- what does "destruction" mean? "Everlasting life" -- what does "life" mean? The adjective modifies the noun. Examine what each noun means lexically before deciding what the combination means.

5. **ECT must be treated fairly.** The ECT position argues that destruction vocabulary is metaphorical (spiritual ruin, not physical annihilation), that "perish" means "ruined" not "cease to exist," and that the torment passages (Rev 14:10-11; 20:10; Matt 25:41,46) provide the interpretive context for the destruction passages. Document this position without dismissing it. The methodology requires reporting what each side infers from the text.

6. **Prior study connections matter.** etc-05 established that gehenna uses apollymi (E028, E189, E197). etc-03 established that "the wages of sin is death" (E087) and "the second death" (E123, E124). etc-02 established that immortality is conditional (E024, E026). These form the broader framework. Note where destruction vocabulary reinforces or complicates these prior findings.
