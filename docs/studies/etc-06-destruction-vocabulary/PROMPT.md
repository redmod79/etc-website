# Bible Study: Destruction Vocabulary — What Words Does Scripture Use for the Fate of the Wicked?

## Question

What words does the Bible use to describe the fate of the wicked? Examine the primary Hebrew and Greek destruction vocabulary: abad/apollumi (perish/destroy), shamad (destroy/annihilate), kalah (consume/finish), shachath (corruption/destruction), apoleia (destruction/perdition), olethros (destruction/ruin), and related terms. What do these words semantically mean — their lexical definitions, their range of usage, and their grammatical forms in key passages? Do they describe ongoing conscious torment, or cessation of existence/destruction? How does the destruction vocabulary in eschatological contexts relate to the torment vocabulary (basanismos, basanizo)? Do these two vocabularies describe the same outcome or different ones?

#### The Critical LXX Bridge (H6 → G622)

The LXX translates H6 (abad) as G622 (apollumi) 141 times (PMI score 6.14) — the dominant correspondence. This bridges the Hebrew "perish/destroy" vocabulary to the NT Greek. When Psalm 37:20 says the wicked shall "perish" (abad), the LXX uses apollumi. When John 3:16 says believers shall not "perish" (apollumi), the word carries the same semantic field.

| etc5-05-four-hell-words | Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, Tartaroo word study | Immediately prior study — established that gehenna uses apollumi not basanizo |

**Key findings from prior series context (etc5-01 through etc5-05):**

From etc5-05 (Four Hell Words): The verb used in Matt 10:28 for what God does in gehenna is apollumi (aorist active infinitive) = "to destroy completely." Torment vocabulary (basanismos) is absent from all 12 gehenna passages. The source text of gehenna imagery (Isa 66:24) depicts fire and worm acting on corpses (pigre), not conscious persons. Eternal fire on Sodom produced ashes (Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6). IB008 was established: the ongoing torment language of Rev 20:10 (devil/beast/false prophet) and Rev 14:10-11 (beast-worshippers) is specific to named entities/groups; its universal extension to all in the lake of fire is moderate-weight AGAINST.

From etc5-01 (What Is Man): God is able to destroy both soul and body in gehenna (Matt 10:28 = E026). The soul is not beyond God's destructive power (N008).

From etc5-02 (Who Has Immortality): Mortals must "put on" immortality at the resurrection. The three NT immortality-positive words (athanasia, aphtharsia, aphthartos) are never applied to the present human state.

From etc5-03 (Biblical Death): G622 (apollumi) = "destroy fully / perish completely." Thanatos (death) is placed in direct opposition to zoe (life) throughout Paul — they are antithetical, not two modes of the same existence.

From etc5-04 (State of the Dead): Without resurrection, the dead in Christ have "perished" (apollumi — 1 Cor 15:18). Between death and resurrection the dead are "not living" (Rev 20:5). Hades = temporary holding; lake of fire = second death.

### Focus Areas

Based on tool discoveries, the following constitute the critical analytical targets:

1. **The apollumi / abad semantic equivalence**: The LXX bridge (abad → apollumi, PMI 6.14, 141 occurrences) establishes that these two words represent the same conceptual field across the testaments. Analysis must trace this equivalence and ask: what does abad mean in OT eschatological passages, and does apollumi carry the same semantic weight in NT eschatological passages?

2. **Apollumi in eschatological contexts (key passages)**:
   - Matt 10:28 — God "destroys" (apolesai) both soul and body in gehenna

   - Luke 13:3,5 — "ye shall all likewise perish" (apoloisthe)
   - 2 Pet 3:9 — "not willing that any should perish" (apolesthai)
   - John 10:28 — "they shall never perish" (apolontai)
   - Matt 18:14 — "that one of these little ones should perish" (apolesthai)
   - 1 Cor 15:18 — without resurrection the dead in Christ "are perished" (apolonto)

3. **Apoleia in eschatological contexts (key passages)**:
   - Matt 7:13 — "broad road that leads to destruction" (apoleian)
   - Phil 3:19 — "whose end is destruction" (apOleia)
   - 2 Th 2:3 — "the son of perdition" (apOleias)
   - Rev 17:8,11 — the beast "goeth into perdition" (apOleian)
   - 2 Pet 2:1,3 — "swift destruction" (apOleian) for false teachers
   - Heb 10:39 — "perdition" (apOleian) vs. saving of the soul

4. **Olethros in eschatological contexts**:
   - 2 Th 1:9 — "everlasting destruction" (olethron aiOnion) from the presence of the Lord
   - 1 Th 5:3 — "sudden destruction" (olethros)
   - 1 Cor 5:5 — destruction of the flesh (olethron)
   - 1 Tim 6:9 — "destruction and perdition" (olethron kai apOleian)

5. **Hebrew abad in Psalmic eschatological passages**:
   - Psa 37:20 — "the wicked shall perish" (yobedu); "enemies of the LORD... shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away"
   - Psa 37:9,22,34,38 — "cut off" (karat) vs. "inherit the land"
   - Psa 73:27 — "they that are far from thee shall perish" (yobedu)
   - Psa 1:6 — "the way of the ungodly shall perish" (tobed)
   - Psa 92:7-9 — "they shall be destroyed" (yishamedu)
   - Psa 104:35 — "let sinners be consumed (yittamu) out of the earth"

6. **Hebrew shamad in prophetic eschatological contexts**:
   - Isa 65:12-15 — the "chosen" vs. those who are "cut off for the slaughter"
   - Dan 2:44 — the kingdom that "shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms"
   - Amos 9:8 — "I will destroy (shamad) the sinful kingdom from off the face of the earth"
   - Psa 92:8 — "they shall be destroyed (yishamedu) for ever"
   - Psa 37:38 — "the transgressors shall be destroyed (yishamedu) together"

7. **Hebrew kalah (consume/finish) in prophetic contexts**:
   - Isa 66:17 — "they shall be consumed (kalah) together"
   - Nah 1:8-9 — "he will make an utter end (kalah) of the place thereof... affliction shall not rise up the second time"
   - Psa 37:20 — "they shall consume (kalu) away"
   - Ezek 5:12-13 — "mine anger shall be accomplished (kalah)"

8. **Hebrew karat ("cut off") in eschatological Psalms**:
   - Psa 37:9 — "evildoers shall be cut off (yikkaretu)"
   - Psa 37:22 — "such as be cursed of him shall be cut off (yikkaretu)"
   - Psa 37:28 — "the seed of the wicked shall be cut off (nikrat)"
   - Psa 37:34 — "when the wicked are cut off (hikaret), thou shalt see it"
   - Psa 37:38 — "the end of the wicked shall be cut off (nikrat)"
   - Mal 4:1 — "the day that cometh shall burn them up... it shall leave them neither root nor branch"

9. **Phthora (corruption/decay) in contexts affecting the wicked**:
   - Gal 6:8 — "shall of the flesh reap corruption (phthoran)"
   - 2 Pet 2:12 — "shall utterly perish (kataphthareontai) in their own corruption (phthora)"
   - 2 Pet 2:19 — bondage to corruption (phthoras)
   - Col 2:22 — "all to perish (phthorai) with the using"

10. **Obadiah 1:16 — "be as though they had not been"**:
   This passage describes the ultimate outcome as non-existence — the nations drink God's wrath and "they shall be as though they had not been." Analysis of this extraordinary expression.

11. **Mal 4:1-3 — fire, stubble, ashes**:
   The wicked as "stubble" that the fire "burns up"; they become "ashes under the soles of feet." The "root and branch" formula. Contrast with the sun of righteousness rising with healing in its wings.

12. **Nah 1:8-9 — "an utter end" and "affliction shall not rise up the second time"**:
   Analysis of the kalah language and the implication that the destruction is terminal — it will not happen twice because the subject will not survive to experience it twice.

13. **The destruction vs. torment vocabulary contrast**:
   Key question: what is the lexical distribution between (a) destruction words (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora, abad, shamad, kalah, karat) and (b) torment words (basanizo, basanismos, timoria)? Do they appear in the same passages applied to the same subjects? Or do they appear in different passages/with different subjects? This is the central analytical challenge.

14. **2 Pet 2:12 — "as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed"**:
   The explicit comparison of false teachers to animals made for destruction. Analysis of the phtheiro/phthora vocabulary in this passage.

15. **The aionion qualifier on destruction terms**:
   - 2 Th 1:9: "everlasting destruction" (olethron aiOnion) — what does aionion modify? Does eternal/age-lasting destruction mean destruction that is ongoing or destruction whose result/effects are permanent?
   - Matt 25:46: same adjective (aiOnion) on both "punishment" (kolasin) and "life" (zOEn)
