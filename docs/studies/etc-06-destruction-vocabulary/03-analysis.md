## Study: etc5-06 — Destruction Vocabulary
## Series: ETC5 — The Final Fate of the Wicked

---

## Overview

The central question this study addresses is whether the primary biblical vocabulary for the fate of the wicked — the destruction word-group (Hebrew: abad, shamad, kalah, karat, tamam; Greek: apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora) — describes cessation of existence or ongoing conscious torment. The secondary question is how this vocabulary relates lexically and exegetically to the torment word-group (basanizo, basanismos, kolasis) that appears in a smaller number of passages.

The analysis proceeds by word group, then by key passage clusters, then addresses the lexical separation between destruction and torment vocabulary, and closes with the difficult passages.

## Part 1: Greek Destruction Vocabulary — apollumi (G622)

### Lexical Foundation

The BLB lexical definition: "from apo (from, away) + the base of ollumi (to destroy); to destroy fully (reflexively, to perish, or lose), literally or figuratively."

In 92 NT occurrences, apollumi spans from concrete physical destruction (wineskins burst: Mat 9:17; Luke 5:37) to death (shipwreck: Acts 27:34) to the dissolution of the heavens (Heb 1:11) to eschatological judgment (Mat 10:28; Jn 3:16). The Greek parsing data confirm the core forms used in eschatological contexts:

- **Mat 10:28**: ἀπολέσαι — Aorist Active Infinitive. The aorist treats the destruction as a discrete, complete event. Active voice makes God the agent. Object is both ψυχὴν (soul) and σῶμα (body).
- **Jn 3:16**: ἀπόληται — 2nd Aorist Middle Subjunctive, 3rd Person Singular. The subjunctive appears in the purpose clause (ἵνα): "in order that everyone believing in him should not perish."
- **1 Cor 15:18**: ἀπόλοντο — Aorist Middle Indicative, 3rd Plural. Completed destruction: "they have perished."
- **Present participle** (apollumenois): used four times — 1 Cor 1:18; 2 Cor 2:15; 2 Cor 4:3; 2 Th 2:10 — describing the class "those who are perishing" as an ongoing process toward destruction, contrasted with "those who are being saved."

The word is never used in any NT text to mean "to suffer consciously without dying." In all 92 occurrences, the semantic range is: to lose/be lost; to ruin; to destroy; to perish. It never appears in proximity to basanizō or basanismos in the same judgment description.

### LXX Bridge: H6 (abad) → G622 (apollumi)

The LXX translates H6 (abad) as G622 (apollumi) 141 times, with a PMI score of 6.14 — the dominant cross-testament correspondence. This means that when NT writers use apollumi for eschatological destruction, they are drawing on the same semantic range as the Hebrew abad in the Psalms, Proverbs, and Prophets. When Psalm 37:20 says "the wicked shall perish [yobedu]" and the LXX renders this as "shall perish [apolontai]," the conceptual field is continuous from OT to NT.

### Key Eschatological Passages

**Matthew 10:28 — God destroys both soul and body**

The verse distinguishes: (a) human killers can only kill the body, not the soul; (b) God can destroy (apolesai — aorist active infinitive) BOTH soul AND body in gehenna. The explicit pairing of psuche and soma as both destroyable is significant for the soul's mortality question (established in E026 and N008 from prior studies).

The verb is apollumi — not basanizō. The action described is "destroy," not "torment." The location is gehenna. The aorist active infinitive presents this as a single, complete act of destruction.

**John 3:16 — perish vs. eternal life (antithesis)**

The Greek text: "...ἵνα πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων εἰς αὐτὸν μὴ ἀπόληται ἀλλ' ἔχῃ ζωὴν αἰώνιον." Structure: "in order that everyone believing... should not perish [apollutai] BUT HAVE [all' eche] eternal life [zoen aionion]."

The adversative conjunction ἀλλ' (but/rather) places apollumi and zoe aionios in direct antithetical relationship. The antithesis is between two mutually exclusive outcomes: perishing and having life. The text does not present the alternative as two modes of ongoing conscious existence; it presents it as perishing versus having life.

The cross-testament parallel data confirm the Johannine life/perish cluster is strong and self-consistent: John 3:15, 3:36, 6:40, 6:47, 12:25; 1 John 5:11, 5:13 all use the same life/perish antithesis. Parallel data further connect this cluster to Genesis 3:22 ("lest he... live for ever"), confirming the long biblical arc from the tree of life to John 3:16.

**Luke 13:3, 5 — "ye shall all likewise perish"**

The double repetition (identical sentence: "except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish [apoloisthe]") using the aorist middle subjunctive of apollumi. The consequence of unrepentance is stated as "perishing," not torment. Perishing here is the counterpart to the deaths of the Galileans and the eighteen crushed by the tower — physical deaths — but applied eschatologically.

**2 Peter 3:9 — "not willing that any should perish"**

"Not willing that any should perish [apolesthai — aorist middle infinitive of apollumi]." God's will is the non-perishing of all people. The contrast is with "all should come to repentance." The alternative to repentance is stated as perishing (apollumi), not torment.

**1 Corinthians 15:18 — "the dead in Christ are perished"**

This text is crucial for understanding what apollumi means. Paul says: if there is no resurrection, then "those who fell asleep in Christ have perished [apolonto]." Paul is using apollumi to describe the hypothetical worst case if resurrection is false — their complete and total destruction, with no continuing existence. This confirms that for Paul, apollumi in its eschatological sense means cessation of existence, not ongoing conscious torment; otherwise the absence of resurrection would not be a disaster.

**Hebrews 1:11 — "they shall perish" (heavens)**

The heavens themselves "shall perish [apolountai]." The word is applied to inanimate creation dissolving. Apollumi here cannot mean conscious torment; it describes the cosmic dissolution of the heavens. This confirms the word's core semantic field includes complete dissolution/cessation, not merely ongoing suffering.

---

## Part 2: Greek Destruction Vocabulary — apoleia (G684)

### Lexical Foundation

Apoleia (feminine noun, derived from apollumi): "ruin or loss (physical, spiritual or eternal)." The BLB count is 20 NT occurrences. KJV renders it as perdition, destruction, waste, perish, damnation — all within the ruin/destruction semantic field.

The word describes the state or condition of being destroyed/ruined — the noun form of apollumi's semantic field.

### Key Eschatological Passages

**Matthew 7:13-14 — "broad road to destruction"**

Two roads: one to apoleia (destruction), one to zoe (life). The antithesis of apoleia and zoe establishes their mutual exclusivity. The road to destruction stands opposite the road to life — not the road to torment vs. the road to life.

**Philippians 3:18-19 — "whose end is destruction"**

Greek: "ὧν τὸ τέλος ἀπώλεια" — predicate nominative with no verb: "their telos IS destruction." Telos = end, outcome, goal. The enemies of the cross have apoleia as their telos (final outcome). No torment vocabulary is used. The word is apoleia, functioning as the climactic descriptor of their final state.

**Romans 9:22 — "vessels of wrath fitted to destruction"**

"Vessels of wrath fitted [katērtismena — perfect passive participle] to destruction [apoleia]." The perfect passive participle implies the preparation for destruction is complete and final. The vessels of wrath are contrasted with vessels of mercy "prepared unto glory." Two opposed outcomes: glory (for mercy) and destruction (for wrath).

**Hebrews 10:39 — "perdition vs. saving of the soul"**

"Not of them who draw back unto perdition [apoleia] but of them that believe to the saving [peripoiesis] of the soul [psuche]." The two opposed paths: apoleia (perdition/destruction) and the saving of the soul. If apoleia described ongoing torment, "the saving of the soul" would mean escape from torment — but the word apoleia is the noun form of destroy/lose, meaning the soul is saved from destruction/being lost.

**Revelation 17:8, 11 — "beast goes into perdition"**

The beast's destiny is described twice as "going into perdition [apoleia]." The beast was, is not, and "shall go into perdition." This is the same vocabulary (apoleia) used for destruction throughout the NT epistles. Whether the beast's fate in apoleia is identical to the "torment day and night for ever and ever" of Rev 20:10 is an exegetical question the text does not explicitly resolve, since both terms are used for Revelation's eschatological entities.

---

## Part 3: Greek Destruction Vocabulary — olethros (G3639)

### Lexical Foundation

Olethros (masculine noun): "ruin, i.e. death, punishment: destruction." From the same base as apollumi (ollumi = to destroy). Only 4 NT occurrences — the smallest corpus of the destruction-word group.

### All Four Occurrences Analyzed

**1 Thessalonians 5:3 — "sudden destruction"**

"When they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction [aiphnidios olethros] cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape." The modifier "sudden" (aiphnidios) emphasizes abruptness — the labor-pain simile emphasizes inevitability and the inability to escape. Olethros here is acute, certain, and inescapable. The word is not modified by ongoing-torment vocabulary.

**2 Thessalonians 1:9 — "everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord"**

The full phrase in Greek: "ὄλεθρον αἰώνιον ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δόξης τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ" — "everlasting/age-lasting destruction [olethron aionion] from the face/presence [apo prosopou] of the Lord and from the glory of his power."

The Greek parsing confirms: olethros is accusative masculine (object of the penalty-paying: "who shall pay the penalty of everlasting destruction"), modified by aionion (accusative masculine adjective agreeing with olethros). The word aionion attaches to OLETHROS (destruction), not to basanismos (torment).

The phrase "apo prosopou tou Kyriou" (from the face/presence of the Lord) admits two readings:
- (a) SOURCE: the destruction is caused by/proceeds from the Lord's presence — like fire proceeding from God's glory (cf. Isa 2:10,19,21 where hiding from God's presence = destruction occurring)
- (b) SEPARATION: the destruction involves banishment/removal from the Lord's presence

Both readings are grammatically possible. The parallel passages in OT eschatology (the cross-testament tool identified Psalms 73:12 and Deuteronomy 33:27 as the OT parallels, both of which use God's power in a destructive/protective sense) do not conclusively favor one reading.

The key observation for the destruction vs. torment question: the noun Paul selects for the wicked's eternal punishment is olethros (destruction/ruin), not basanismos (torment). Olethros is a noun of result — it names what happens when something is ruined/destroyed — rather than a noun of ongoing process.

**1 Corinthians 5:5 — "destruction of the flesh"**

Paul commands delivering the immoral man "to Satan for the destruction [olethron] of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." Olethros here is applied to a living person — the flesh is to be destroyed — with a redemptive purpose (the spirit may be saved). This confirms olethros refers to physical/existential ruin (destruction of the flesh) rather than ongoing conscious torment.

**1 Timothy 6:9 — "destruction and perdition"**

"Many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction [olethron] and perdition [apoleia]." The two terms appear together as a hendiadys (two-term expression for one concept): both olethros and apoleia denote ruin/destruction. Their pairing confirms semantic complementarity — they are from the same destruction semantic field, not the torment field.

---

## Part 4: Greek Destruction Vocabulary — phthora (G5356) and related

### Lexical Foundation

Phthora: "from phtheíro (to decay); decay, i.e. ruin (spontaneous or inflicted, literally or figuratively): corruption." The LXX bridge connects phthora to H7843 (shachath = to decay, ruin, corrupt) via G1311 (diaphtheiro, PMI 7.00 — the dominant LXX equivalent).

### Key Passages

**Galatians 6:8 — "reap corruption"**

"He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption [phthoran]; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting [zoen aionion]." The antithesis: phthora (corruption/decay) vs. zoe aionios (eternal life). The outcome of flesh-sowing is not torment but corruption/decay — the flesh deteriorates and gives no lasting return.

**2 Peter 2:12 — "made to be taken and destroyed"**

False teachers are "as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed [phthoran], speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish [phtharesontai] in their own corruption [phthora]."

Three uses of the phthora-phtheiro word group in one context:
1. "Made to be taken and destroyed [phthoran]" — the animals' nature: they are prey, designed to be consumed
2. "Shall utterly perish [phtharesontai]" — future passive: they will be thoroughly destroyed/ruined
3. "In their own corruption [phthora]" — their ruin is their own moral decay working out to its end

The simile to animals "made to be taken and destroyed" is significant. Animals made for consumption do not experience eternal conscious torment when killed — they die. The comparison places the false teachers in the same category of destiny.

---

## Part 5: Hebrew Destruction Vocabulary

### H6 — abad: the Hebrew root of the cross-testament bridge

**Psalm 1:4-6 — way of the ungodly shall perish**

The ungodly are like "chaff which the wind driveth away" (v.4). Hebrew parsing: "tobed" = Root H6 (abad), Qal Imperfect 3fs, subject = "the way of the ungodly." The chaff simile provides the interpretive key: chaff driven by wind disperses completely, leaving nothing. The simile is destruction, not torment.

**Psalm 9:3-6 — perish at God's presence**

Three uses of abad in close proximity: enemies "fall and perish [abad] at thy presence"; "thou hast destroyed [abad] the wicked"; "their memorial is perished [abad] with them." The passage adds: the wicked's name is "put out for ever and ever" and "destructions are come to a perpetual end" (v.6). The combination of perishing + memorial erased + name blotted out constitutes the OT portrait of utter cessation.

**Psalm 37 — the most comprehensive eschatological destruction cluster**

Psalm 37 deploys five distinct Hebrew destruction terms across the same chapter, creating the most concentrated OT treatment of the wicked's fate:

| Verse | Hebrew Term | Parsing | Translation |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 37:2 | karat (simile) | — | "shall soon be cut down" (grass simile) |
| 37:9 | karat (H3772) | Niphal Impf 3mp | "evildoers shall be cut off" |
| 37:10 | ain (H369) | non-existence particle | "the wicked shall not be"; "he is not" (ainenu) |
| 37:20 | abad (H6) | Qal Impf 3mp | "the wicked shall perish" |
| 37:20 | kalah (H3615) | Qal Perf 3p (×2) | "they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away" |
| 37:22 | karat | Niphal Impf 3mp | "cursed of him shall be cut off" |
| 37:28 | karat | Niphal Perf 3ms | "seed of the wicked shall be cut off" |
| 37:34 | karat | Niphal Inf Abs | "when the wicked are cut off" |
| 37:36 | ain | non-existence particle | "he was not" (ain hu) |
| 37:38 | shamad (H8045) | Niphal Perf 3p | "transgressors shall be destroyed together" |
| 37:38 | karat | Niphal Perf 3fs | "end of the wicked shall be cut off" |

The grammatical observations:
- All karat forms (vv.9, 22, 28, 34, 38) are **Niphal** — passive voice: the wicked are cut off by God's action, not by their own decision.
- The ain particle in v.10 uses two forms: "there is no wicked person" (ain rasha) + "he is not there" (ainenu) — the second specifically denying any traceable presence at his former location.
- Psalm 37:38 closes the cluster with a double hammer: shamad (destroyed) + karat (cut off) applied to "the transgressors" and "the end of the wicked."
- Psalm 37:20 uses kalah twice in the same verse — the doubled form intensifies the completeness: "they are consumed — into smoke they are consumed." Smoke dissipates and leaves nothing.

**Psalm 37 does not use any word from the basanizo/torment semantic field.** The cluster of destruction terms — abad, karat, shamad, kalah, ain — consistently depicts termination, not preservation in suffering.

**Psalm 68:2 — wicked perish as melting wax and driven smoke**

"As smoke is driven away... as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish [yobedu — abad, Qal Impf 3mp] at the presence of God." Two similes interpret abad:
- Smoke driven away: disperses, becomes invisible, ceases to exist as smoke
- Wax melting: loses form, dissolves, ceases to exist as wax

The presence of God (paralleling 2 Th 1:9's "from the presence of the Lord") is the agent of this dissolution.

**Psalm 73:27 — they that are far from thee shall perish**

"They that are far from thee shall perish [yobedu — abad, Qal Impf 3mp]: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee." The parallel phrase uses H6789 (tsamat, Hiphil Perfect 2ms = "thou hast silenced/destroyed"). Distance from God = perishing. Proximity to God = the alternative.

**Psalm 92:7, 9 — destroyed for ever; shall perish**

"They shall be destroyed for ever [shamad + ad-olam]" (v.7); "for lo, thine enemies shall perish [yobedu — abad]" (v.9). The modifier "ad-olam" (unto the age/forever) attaches to shamad (destroy) — the destruction is permanent and age-lasting. This is the Hebrew equivalent of "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion, 2 Th 1:9).

**Psalm 104:35 — consumed; be no more**

"Let the sinners be consumed [yittamu — tamam, Qal Impf 3mp, jussive] out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more [wicked + einam — non-existence particle + 3mp suffix]." The consumption (tamam) leads to non-existence (einam). The sequential pairing of tamam (be finished/consumed) + ain (non-existence) states the causal result: consumed → therefore no more.

### H8045 — shamad: desolate, bring to nought

Shamad is a strong annihilation verb — "to desolate, bring to nought, overthrow." The LXX renders it primarily as apollumi (23x, PMI 4.53).

Key eschatological occurrences:
- Psalm 37:38: "the transgressors shall be destroyed [nishmadu — Niphal Perfect 3p] together"
- Psalm 92:7: "they shall be destroyed for ever [yishammedu ad-olam]"
- Psalm 145:20: "all the wicked will he destroy [shamad, Hiphil Impf]"
- Amos 9:8: "I will destroy [shamad] the sinful kingdom from off the face of the earth"

### H3615 / H3617 — kalah: consume, come to a full end

Kalah as a verb covers neutral completion (finishing building) to destructive consumption (fire consuming). As a noun (kalah/killayon), it denotes a complete end.

**Nahum 1:8-9 — "utter end... affliction shall not rise up the second time"**

"He will make an utter end [kalah — noun H3617] of the place thereof... he will make an utter end [kalah]: affliction shall not rise up the second time." The phrase "affliction shall not rise up the second time" is the interpretive key: the destruction is so thorough that the threat cannot recur. This implies complete elimination, not ongoing preservation in torment. If the enemy were preserved in torment, the affliction could theoretically continue.

**Isaiah 66:17 — "shall be consumed together"**

"They that sanctify themselves... eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed [kalah] together." The consumption is collective ("together") and complete (kalah).

### H3772 — karat: cut off

Karat (to cut off) in eschatological judgment contexts consistently uses the Niphal (passive) — the wicked are cut off by God. Five Niphal forms appear in Psalm 37 alone (vv.9, 22, 28, 34, 38). The imagery of being "cut off" is removal from the community of life — cessation of participation, not preservation in torment.

The LXX renders karat's judgment uses as ekkoptō (to cut out, G1581, PMI 5.07) — "cut out/off" as in the Matthean parable of the tree cut down and thrown into fire (Mat 3:10).

---

## Part 6: Key OT Prophetic Passages

### Malachi 4:1-3 — stubble, fire, ashes

The text: "the day that cometh shall burn them up... it shall leave them neither root nor branch... they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet."

The progression: (1) wicked = stubble (dry combustible material); (2) the day burns them up completely; (3) "neither root nor branch" — idiom for total elimination, nothing remaining; (4) they become ashes (epher, H665).

The Hebrew word epher (ashes) is used for the result of complete combustion — what remains after fire has fully consumed something. The word is used for the ashes of the burnt offering (Lev 4:12; Num 19:9,10). Ashes cannot experience torment. They represent the residue of complete combustion.

The cross-testament parallel data confirm Malachi 4:1 has its strongest OT parallel at Isaiah 5:24 ("as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff... their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust") — a fire-consuming-stubble pattern that represents total destruction. The NT parallel at 2 Peter 3:7-12 connects the day-of-burning imagery to the eschatological fire.

### Obadiah 1:16 — "as though they had not been"

"They shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been [lo hayah — 'as-not they-were'; Hebrew: כְּלוֹא הָיוּ]."

The phrase "as though they had not been" is the strongest OT non-existence statement for the fate of the nations. The formula is: they will be in the condition of not-having-existed. Their status will be equivalent to non-existence. This is not a description of torment; it is a description of being as if they never existed.

The cross-testament parallel tool could not find a close NT parallel for the key phrase (the "not-been" formula is unique), which confirms this expression is not reproduced in NT eschatology but stands as the strongest OT statement of non-existence.

### Ezekiel 28:18-19 — "never shalt thou be any more"

The fire "from the midst" of the king of Tyre devours him and brings him "to ashes upon the earth." Then: "never shalt thou be any more [lo tehyeh + lo]" — a double negation of future existence. The fire reduces to ashes; the ashes confirm the non-being.

### Isaiah 41:11-12 — "as nothing and as a thing of nought"

"They shall be as nothing [ka-ayin — like nothing/non-existence]; as a thing of nought [ka-ephes — as zero/nothing]." Two Hebrew non-existence expressions: ka-ayin (like ayin = like nothing) and ka-ephes (like ephes = like zero, as nothing at all). "Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them."

### Isaiah 26:14 — "they shall not rise"

"They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise." The contrast with Isaiah 26:19 ("Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise") establishes a deliberate contrast: the righteous dead will rise; the "other lords" (opposing forces) shall not rise. This passage requires careful contextual handling — it is Isaiah's psalm about the oppressors, not a universal statement about all the wicked — but within its context it uses non-resurrection as the fate of the wicked.

### Hosea 13:3 — four images of vanishing

"They shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney."

All four images depict complete vanishing: morning cloud evaporates; early dew evaporates; chaff disperses; smoke disappears from the chimney. None of these images is compatible with ongoing torment — all depict total cessation.

## Part 7: The Life/Death Antithesis — Structural Analysis

Across multiple authors and both testaments, the eschatological choice is presented as a binary antithesis between two mutually exclusive outcomes:

| Destruction Term | Life Term | Reference |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| apollumi (perish) | zoe aionios (everlasting life) | Jn 3:16 |
| apoleia (destruction) | zoe (life) | Mat 7:13-14 |
| phthora (corruption) | zoe aionios (eternal life) | Gal 6:8 |
| thanatos (death) | zoe aionios (eternal life) | Rom 6:23 |
| kolasis aionios (everlasting punishment) | zoe aionios (eternal life) | Mat 25:46 |
| apoleia (perdition) | peripoiesis psuches (saving of the soul) | Heb 10:39 |

The consistent structural antithesis places destruction/death opposite to life. If the antithesis were between two modes of ongoing conscious existence (life vs. ongoing torment), the vocabulary on the destruction/death side would not be apollumi, phthora, thanatos, apoleia — it would be torment vocabulary. The fact that the destruction-vocabulary words stand as the antithesis of life (zoe) is an observable lexical/structural pattern.

**1 John 5:11-12 — life is in the Son; he that has not the Son has not life**

"He that hath the Son hath life [zoe]; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life [ouk echei ten zoen]." The absence of the Son = the absence of life. The state of those without the Son is described as "not having life" — not "having torment" or "having death-consciousness." The contrast is life vs. no-life, not life vs. torment-life.

---

## Part 8: Torment vs. Destruction Vocabulary — Lexical Separation

This is the central lexical/analytical finding of this study.

### The Two Vocabulary Sets

**Destruction vocabulary** (never means torment):
- G622 apollumi — destroy fully, perish completely (92 NT occurrences; LXX: H6 abad 141x)
- G684 apoleia — ruin, loss, destruction, perdition (20 NT occurrences)
- G3639 olethros — ruin, destruction (4 NT occurrences)
- G5356 phthora — decay, corruption, ruin (9 NT occurrences)
- H6 abad — perish, be destroyed (184 occurrences)
- H8045 shamad — desolate, bring to nought (90 occurrences)
- H3615 kalah — consume, come to end (206 occurrences)
- H3772 karat — cut off (288 occurrences)
- H8552 tamam — be finished, consumed (64 occurrences)
- H369/H369 ain/ayin — non-existence particle

**Torment vocabulary** (never means destroy/perish):
- G928 basanizo — to torture, torment (12 NT occurrences; Revelation-dominant)
- G929 basanismos — torment (6 NT occurrences; all in Revelation)
- G2851 kolasis — penal infliction, punishment (2 NT occurrences; Mat 25:46; 1 Jn 4:18)
- G5098 timoria — vindication, penalty (1 NT occurrence; Heb 10:29)

### Lexical Distribution in Eschatological Contexts

**Destruction vocabulary** appears throughout the broad biblical eschatological testimony: the Psalms (37, 1, 9, 68, 73, 92, 104), the Prophets (Mal 4, Nah 1, Obad 1, Hos 13, Isa 26, 41, 66), the Synoptic sayings (Mat 10:28; Lk 13:3,5), Pauline letters (Rom 2:12; 6:23; 9:22; Phil 3:19; 2 Th 1:9; 1 Th 5:3), the Petrine letters (2 Pet 2:12; 3:9), Johannine Gospel (Jn 3:16; 10:10, 28; 1 Jn 5:11-12), and Hebrews (1:11; 10:39).

**Torment vocabulary** in eschatological contexts appears in:
- Revelation 14:10-11 — basanizo/basanismos (beast-worshippers: specific group, tribulation context)
- Revelation 20:10 — basanizo (devil, beast, false prophet: three named entities)
- Matthew 25:46 — kolasis aionios (punishment, not torture: at the last judgment)
- Hebrews 10:29 — timoria (punishment for apostates: undefined form)
- Revelation 9:5 — basanizo (locusts: temporary torment during tribulation, explicitly not death)

The lexical observation: basanismo appears exclusively in Revelation in its eschatological uses. Outside Revelation, NT eschatological passages use destruction vocabulary. Within Revelation, the specific passages using basanizo are applied to specific, named subjects (beast-worshippers in a tribulation scenario; the devil and his two prophetic agents).

### Confirmed LXX Separation

The LXX mapping confirms this lexical separation is cross-testamental:
- H6 (abad) → G622 (apollumi): 141 occurrences, PMI 6.14
- H8045 (shamad) → G622 (apollumi): 23 occurrences, PMI 4.53
- Neither H6 nor H8045 nor any other Hebrew destruction term is translated as G928 (basanizo) or G929 (basanismos) anywhere in the LXX

The torment terms (basanizo/basanismos) have a different lexical history: from basanos (a touchstone for testing gold) → extended to torture/testing. Their primary OT background is physical torture of living persons (2 Maccabees 7; 4 Maccabees), not the eschatological vocabulary of the Psalms and Prophets.

---

## Part 9: The Isaiah 34 / Revelation 14 Connection

The cross-testament parallel tool identified **Isaiah 34:10** as the strongest OT parallel for Revelation 14:11 (Hybrid score 0.401 with Theological score 0.30 = "continual, forever" flag).

Isaiah 34:10 describes the judgment of Edom: "It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever."

This is the source text that Revelation 14:11 draws on for the "smoke ascends for ever and ever" imagery. The critical observation: in Isaiah 34, the referent of the ascending smoke is the desolated, burning wasteland of Edom — not conscious persons experiencing ongoing torment. The "for ever" smoke-rising is an image of permanent desolation, not of perpetual suffering. The land was judged and destroyed; the ascending smoke is testimony to its permanent ruination.

Revelation 14:11 applies the same imagery to those who worship the beast. Whether John intends the imagery to be taken literally (ongoing conscious torment in perpetuity) or as an appropriation of Isaiah's permanent-desolation formula is an exegetical question. What the parallel tool establishes is that the source of the "smoke forever" imagery is permanent-desolation language, not a new description of ongoing conscious torment.

## Part 10: Difficult Passages

### 2 Thessalonians 1:9 — "everlasting destruction"

This is the passage most often cited to argue that even the "destruction" language can denote ongoing conscious existence, via the argument that "destruction from the presence of the Lord" means banishment (ongoing separation).

**Three positions on the phrase:**

1. **Destruction is the result, and it is permanent** (conditionalist reading): "Everlasting destruction" = a destruction whose effects are permanent and irreversible. Olethros is a noun of result (naming the state of being ruined), and aionion (everlasting) modifies the permanence of that result. "From the presence of the Lord" = the destruction proceeds from God's presence as its source (as in Ps 68:2: "the wicked perish at the presence of God").

2. **Destruction means separation** (ECT reading): "Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord" = everlasting banishment/separation from God's presence, where "destruction" means the ruination of the relationship rather than cessation of existence.

3. **The word olethros itself**: In its other three NT occurrences, olethros refers to ruin/destruction that is a real event (1 Th 5:3 = sudden destruction; 1 Cor 5:5 = destruction of the flesh; 1 Tim 6:9 = destruction and perdition). None of these uses supports the meaning "ongoing banishment." The word functions as a noun of result in every occurrence.

The OT parallel data connect 2 Th 1:9 most strongly to Romans 9:22 (vessels fitted for "destruction" — apoleia) and Philippians 3:19 (whose end is "destruction" — apoleia). The parallel to Isaiah 34 for the permanent-result reading is supported by the tool's OT connection (Ezekiel 25:15, "age, destruction" for permanent judgment). The reading of "from the presence of the Lord" as source rather than separation is supported by Psalm 68:2 (wicked perish abad "at the presence of God") and Isaiah 2:10,19,21 (people hide from the Lord and his glory = his presence causes destruction).

The word Paul chose (olethros = ruin/destruction) rather than kolasis (punishment/correction) or basanismos (torment) is a textual observation. The aionion modifier attaches to the destruction term, not to the torment term.

### Matthew 25:46 — "everlasting punishment" (kolasis aionion)

The Greek: "ἀπελεύσονται εἰς κόλασιν αἰώνιον, οἱ δὲ δίκαιοι εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον" — "these shall go away into everlasting punishment [kolasin aionion], but the righteous into eternal life [zoen aionion]."

The same adjective (aionion) modifies both outcomes. The word is kolasis (G2851 — from kolazō, "to prune/curtail/chastise"), not olethros, apollumi, or basanismos.

**Observations:**
1. The verse uses punishment vocabulary (kolasis), not destruction vocabulary or torment vocabulary. It is a separate word group from all three destruction terms examined above.
2. Kolasis (G2851) appears only twice in the NT: here, and in 1 John 4:18 ("fear hath torment/punishment [kolasin]" — in a context about love casting out fear). The word denotes penal infliction, punishment with a corrective purpose.
3. The structural antithesis is punishment (for the wicked) vs. life (for the righteous). If the parallel means "both outcomes are of equal duration," then the duration of the punishment matches the duration of the life. If "aionios" means "age-lasting" or "of the coming age" in both cases, both outcomes belong to the same eschatological age-register.
4. The verse does not specify the form of the punishment. Kolasis aionion could be:
   - Ongoing conscious punishment (ECT reading)
   - Permanent destruction as punishment (conditionalist reading — the punishment is real and its result permanent)
   Neither is excluded by the word kolasis itself, which denotes penal action without specifying its form.
5. The fire is described in v.41 as "everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels" — the fire's origin connects to the supernatural entities. The human wicked go into fire prepared for the devil and his angels, not into their own unique punishment.

The verse is analyzed here because it uses the life/punishment antithesis. Whether "everlasting punishment" means ongoing conscious torment or permanent destructive punishment is the I-B question this passage raises.

### Revelation 14:10-11 — "tormented... day and night"

The text: "The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... he shall be tormented [basanisthēsetai — future passive indicative] with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment [basanismou] ascendeth up for ever and ever [eis aionas aionon]: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name."

**Grammatical observations:**
- The subject throughout is "who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark" — a specific tribulation-era class defined by their beast-worship
- "Basanisthēsetai" is future passive indicative — the torment is stated as coming
- "Anabainei" (smoke ascends) is present indicative — presenting the smoke-rising as continuous
- "Eis aionas aionon" (unto ages of ages) is the strongest temporal expression

**The Isaiah 34 connection** (confirmed by the parallel tool, Theo score 0.30 — highest OT parallel): Revelation's "smoke ascends forever" draws on Isaiah 34:10's description of Edom's permanent desolation. The genre of the passage (apocalyptic vision) and the literary background (OT permanent-desolation imagery) are relevant to the question of literal vs. figurative interpretation.

This passage is already registered as E150 (Neutral, reclassified etc5-18, First Appeared: etc5-05). The analysis agent does not reassign its classification; it notes the observational data above.

### Revelation 20:10 — devil/beast/false prophet tormented day and night for ever and ever

The text: "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented [basanisthesontai — future passive indicative, 3rd plural] day and night for ever and ever [eis tous aionas ton aionon]."

**Grammatical observations:**
- Three named entities: the devil (ho diabolos), the beast (to therion), the false prophet (ho pseudoprophetes)
- The torment language is stated for these three entities specifically
- The immediately adjacent verse (v.9) describes the nations surrounding the camp: "fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured [katephagen] them" — the nations are devoured/consumed (different vocabulary and different outcome)
- The immediately following verse (v.15): "whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire" — human wicked are cast in, but without the torment language of v.10

The pattern: three specific eschatological entities (devil, beast, false prophet) receive "tormented day and night for ever and ever"; the nations around the camp are "devoured"; general human wicked are cast into the lake of fire (identified as the second death) without the torment language applied to the three entities.

This passage is already registered as E149 (Neutral, reclassified etc5-18, First Appeared: etc5-05), and IB008 addresses the extension question (Moderate — weight AGAINST universal extension).

## Patterns Identified

1. **The destruction vocabulary (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora, abad, shamad, kalah, karat, tamam) is used consistently throughout both testaments for the fate of the wicked in eschatological contexts, across multiple authors, genres (Psalms, Proverbs, Prophets, Gospels, Epistles), and time periods.** The consistency is cross-author, cross-genre, and cross-testamental.

2. **The torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos) in eschatological contexts is confined to Revelation in the NT, applied to specific named subjects in specific contexts (tribulation-era beast-worshippers; the devil, beast, and false prophet).** It does not appear in the Psalms, the Prophets, the Synoptic Gospels, Paul's letters, Peter's letters, John's Gospel, or 1 John in eschatological contexts.

3. **The life/death antithesis is structurally consistent across both testaments:** the fate of the wicked is expressed as the antithesis of life (zoe), using destruction/death vocabulary — not as an alternative mode of conscious existence. The antithesis is perish vs. have life; destruction vs. life; death vs. eternal life; corruption vs. eternal life.

4. **The non-existence expressions in the OT** (ain in Ps 37:10, 36; Ps 104:35; ka-ayin in Isa 41:11-12; lo tehyeh in Ezek 28:19; lo hayah in Obad 1:16) represent the consistent OT terminus of the destruction vocabulary. After the destruction words, these non-existence expressions appear as the final statement.

5. **The LXX bridge** (H6 abad → G622 apollumi: 141 occurrences, PMI 6.14) confirms that the NT destruction vocabulary is lexically continuous with the OT destruction vocabulary. NT writers using apollumi for the wicked's fate are using the same vocabulary the LXX translators used to render the Psalms' abad passages.

6. **The torment vs. destruction distinction is not redefined or harmonized within the biblical text itself.** Nowhere does any biblical text explain that "destruction" actually means "ongoing conscious torment" or that "perish" is a metaphor for unending suffering. The words carry their plain lexical meanings.

## Connections Between Passages

- **Psalm 37 (OT) ↔ Matthew 10:28 (NT):** Both use destruction vocabulary for the fate of the wicked. Psalm 37 uses abad, karat, shamad, kalah, ain; Matthew 10:28 uses apollumi. The LXX bridge (H6 → G622) connects them lexically.

- **Malachi 4:1-3 ↔ 2 Peter 3:7-12:** Malachi's burning-oven imagery and ashes-result connects via the cross-testament parallel tool to 2 Peter's eschatological fire (2 Pet 3:7 = strongest NT parallel for Mal 4:1, score 0.329). Both depict consuming fire as the agent of judgment.

- **Isaiah 66:24 ↔ Mark 9:43-48:** Direct quotation (parallel tool score 0.424, highest NT score for Isa 66:24). Isaiah: fire and worm act on corpses (pigrê). Mark: Jesus quotes the same passage as imagery for gehenna. The OT source text's subject (corpses) was confirmed in etc5-05 (E141).

- **Isaiah 34:10 ↔ Revelation 14:11:** Parallel tool theological score 0.30 (highest OT parallel for Rev 14:11). Isaiah: smoke rising forever from the desolated land of Edom. Revelation: smoke of torment ascending forever. The OT source is permanent-desolation imagery.

- **Obadiah 1:16 ↔ Revelation's lake of fire:** Obadiah's "as though they had not been" does not have a direct NT parallel (the tool could not match the key concept). But the direction is the same: non-existence as the eschatological terminus.

## Word Study Insights

1. **apollumi** is the single most important Greek word for the fate of the wicked in the NT eschatological vocabulary. Its definition (destroy fully/perish completely), its LXX background (H6 abad, 141x), its usage pattern (never = torment), and its structural role as the antithesis of zoe (life) in Jn 3:16 converge on destruction/cessation.

2. **olethros** — the word Paul uses in the key Pauline eschatological passage (2 Th 1:9 "everlasting destruction") — is a noun of result denoting ruin. In all 4 NT occurrences it means destruction/ruin. It is never paired with basanizo. In the same passage, Paul uses "from the presence of the Lord" as the source/agent of this destruction.

3. **The non-existence particles** (ain/ayin) in the Hebrew OT represent a unique testimony — not destruction words themselves but the negation-of-being that follows the destruction words in Psalm 37 and Psalm 104. They confirm that the destruction words lead to non-existence as their stated result.

4. **The Nahum 1:9 phrase** — "affliction shall not rise up the second time" — is uniquely explicit about the terminal character of the destruction. The enemy cannot threaten again because no remnant survives to mount a second threat.

5. **The separation of basanizo/basanismos from the LXX destruction-vocabulary words** is confirmed by the LXX mapping data: H6 (abad), H8045 (shamad), H3615 (kalah), H3772 (karat) are all rendered by destruction-vocabulary Greek terms, never by basanizo or basanismos.
