# Destruction Vocabulary -- Verse Analysis

## INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY
- This study investigates the Hebrew and Greek destruction vocabulary used for the fate of the wicked. The role is investigator, not advocate.
- Evidence is gathered from all relevant passages. Where passages support different interpretive positions, both readings are noted.
- Statements below report what the text says. Interpretive inferences are classified separately.
- No editorial language is used. Passages are quoted and observations stated.

## I. Lexical Definitions and Semantic Ranges

### A. Hebrew Destruction Words

**H6 abad (184 occurrences):** Primitive root meaning "to wander away, lose oneself; to perish; to destroy." Intransitive: to perish, to be lost, to cease to exist. Causative (Hiphil/Piel): to destroy, to cause to perish. The primary concept in every stem is cessation: the subject ceases to exist, to function, or to be present. KJV translations: "perish" (56x combined forms), "destroy" (30x combined forms), "lost" (4x).

**H8045 shamad (90 occurrences):** Primitive root meaning "to desolate, to destroy utterly, to exterminate, to annihilate, to bring to nought." The intensified meaning relative to abad: complete, total destruction. Shamad implies thoroughness -- wiping out. KJV translations: "destroy" (34x combined forms), "destroyed" (15x combined forms), "utterly" (2x).

**H3615 kalah (206 occurrences):** Primitive root with dual meaning: (1) to complete, finish (neutral); (2) to consume, use up, spend (destructive). When applied to persons under divine judgment, the destructive sense dominates: being consumed, spent up, exhausted into nothingness. The consumption metaphor is central: as fat is consumed in fire, as substance is used up, so the wicked are consumed. KJV translations: "consume" (12x combined forms), "made an end" (13x), "finished" (6x), "fail" (14x combined forms).

**H7843 shachath (147 occurrences):** Primitive root meaning "to decay, to corrupt, to ruin, to destroy, to spoil, to mar." The broadest of the four Hebrew words, encompassing both physical destruction and moral corruption. Root idea: rendering something unfit for its purpose, spoiling it. KJV translations: "destroy" (41x combined forms), "corrupt" (7x combined forms), "marred" (2x).

### B. Greek Destruction Words

**G622 apollymi (92 occurrences):** From apo + the base of olethros. Active: to destroy fully, to put to death. Middle/Passive: to perish, to be destroyed, to be lost. This is the primary NT destruction verb. It is the Greek cognate of Hebrew abad via the LXX (141x translation correspondence), making it the NT continuation of the OT's primary destruction vocabulary.

**G684 apoleia (20 occurrences):** Noun form of apollymi. Meaning: destruction, ruin, loss, waste. KJV translates as "perdition" (5x), "destruction" (4x), "waste" (2x). English "perdition" derives from Latin perdere (to lose/destroy) -- the same semantic field. Apoleia is not a different concept from destruction; it IS destruction as a state or destination.

**G3639 olethros (4 occurrences):** From primary root ollymi (to destroy). Meaning: destruction, ruin, death. All four NT uses involve destruction/ruin. The word never carries the meaning of "ongoing conscious torment" in any occurrence. Etymologically related to apollymi, placing it in the same word family.

### C. No Destruction Word Carries the Meaning "Ongoing Conscious Torment"

Across all seven words (four Hebrew, three Greek), totaling approximately 743 occurrences in both testaments:
- No lexicon defines any of these words as "torment" or "ongoing conscious suffering."
- No occurrence uses any of these words to describe a state of continued conscious existence in pain.
- The consistent semantic field is: perish, destroy, consume, corrupt, ruin, cease to exist, be brought to nothing.

The torment vocabulary (basanizo G928, basanismos G929, kolasis G2851) constitutes a separate word family with a different semantic range.

## II. LXX Translation Patterns Confirming Hebrew-Greek Equivalences

The Septuagint (LXX) translation patterns establish verified textual connections (#4a SIS) between the Hebrew and Greek destruction vocabularies. Pre-Christian Jewish translators consistently mapped Hebrew destruction words to Greek destruction words:

### A. abad (H6) -> apollymi (G622): 141 times
This is the dominant mapping with a PMI score of 30.45 (extremely high statistical association). When OT authors wrote abad and NT authors wrote apollymi, they drew from the same semantic well. The LXX also translates abad as apoleia (G684) 11 times, extending the chain: abad -> apollymi -> apoleia.

### B. shamad (H8045) -> apollymi (G622): 23 times
The LXX routes shamad through the same Greek word (apollymi), reinforcing that the two Hebrew destruction words converge on a single Greek destruction word. Additionally, shamad -> exairo ("to remove completely") 12 times and shamad -> apoleia 5 times.

### C. kalah (H3615) -> synteleo (G4931): 85 times
The consumption word maps to "to complete entirely, to consume." Additional mappings: kalah -> ekleipo ("to cease, fail") 30 times, kalah -> pauo ("to stop, cease") 15 times. The LXX also uses analisko (G355, "to consume") for kalah 3 times -- the same Greek word Paul uses in 2 Thess 2:8 ("whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth").

### D. shachath (H7843) -> diaphtheiro (G1311): 48 times
The corruption/destruction word maps to "to rot thoroughly, to ruin." Additional mapping: shachath -> phtheiro (G5351, "to corrupt, destroy") 6 times. The noun form diaphthora (G1312, "decay, corruption") connects to Acts 2:27,31 and Acts 13:34-37, where the corruption of the grave is the subject. This links shachath's destruction/corruption semantics directly to NT grave-corruption vocabulary.

### E. Convergence Pattern
Two of the four Hebrew destruction words (abad and shamad) converge on a single Greek word: apollymi. This means the NT's most common destruction verb (apollymi, 92x) carries the combined semantic weight of both abad (184x) and shamad (90x) -- 274 Hebrew occurrences behind a single Greek word.

## III. Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### A. The abad/apollymi Eschatological Passages

#### Psalm 1:6
**Text:** "The LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish (abad)."
**Context:** Wisdom psalm contrasting the righteous and the wicked. The righteous are like a tree planted by rivers of water (v.3); the wicked are like chaff driven away by the wind (v.4).
**Direct statement:** The way of the ungodly perishes.
**Key observations:** The simile is chaff -- a substance blown away and ceasing to be present. Not a substance that endures in torment. The contrast is "known by the LORD" vs. "perish."

#### Psalm 2:12
**Text:** "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish (abad) from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little."
**Context:** Royal/messianic psalm about God's anointed king.
**Direct statement:** Those who do not submit to the Son perish when his wrath is kindled.
**Key observations:** Perishing is the consequence of divine wrath -- cessation, not preservation in torment.

#### Psalm 37:9-10,20,34-38
**Text (v.9-10):** "Evildoers shall be cut off... yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be."
**Text (v.20):** "The wicked shall perish (abad), and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume (kalah); into smoke shall they consume away."
**Text (v.34-38):** "When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it... he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found... the transgressors shall be destroyed (shamad) together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off."
**Context:** Wisdom psalm of David about the fate of the righteous and the wicked.
**Direct statement:** The wicked "shall not be." Their place "shall not be." They are like fat of lambs -- consumed. They consume into smoke. They "pass away" and "could not be found."
**Key observations:** This psalm uses THREE destruction words in a single passage: abad (v.20), kalah (v.20), and shamad (v.38). The language is cumulative: perish, consume into smoke, be destroyed, be cut off, "shall not be." The simile of fat consumed in fire describes a substance that ceases to exist through burning. Smoke dissipates and is gone. The repeated phrase "shall not be" states non-existence.

#### Psalm 68:1-2
**Text:** "As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish (abad) at the presence of God."
**Context:** Psalm of triumph; God arises and his enemies are scattered.
**Direct statement:** The wicked perish at God's presence as wax melts before fire.
**Key observations:** Two similes: smoke driven away (dissipates), wax melting before fire (consumed, loses form). Both depict substances that cease to exist in their original form. Neither depicts ongoing existence.

#### Psalm 73:17-20,27
**Text (v.17-19):** "Then understood I their end. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed (kalah) with terrors."
**Text (v.27):** "They that are far from thee shall perish (abad): thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee."
**Context:** Asaph's wisdom psalm about the prosperity of the wicked.
**Direct statement:** The wicked are "cast down into destruction," "utterly consumed," and "perish."
**Key observations:** "As in a moment" -- the destruction is sudden, not an ongoing process. "Utterly consumed" (kalah) -- consumed completely. "As a dream when one awaketh" (v.20) -- they cease to have substance.

#### Psalm 92:7-9
**Text:** "When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed (shamad) for ever. But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore. For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish (abad); all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered."
**Context:** Sabbath psalm contrasting the temporary flourishing of the wicked with the permanence of God.
**Direct statement:** The wicked shall be destroyed (shamad) forever; the enemies of the LORD shall perish (abad).
**Key observations:** Two destruction words together: shamad and abad. "Destroyed for ever" pairs a duration qualifier with a destruction verb. The contrast is between the wicked (who flourish temporarily, then are destroyed permanently) and the LORD (who is "most high for evermore"). The grass simile: grass springs up quickly and dies. The permanence is in the destruction (it is forever), not in continued existence.

#### Psalm 145:20
**Text:** "The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy (shamad)."
**Context:** David's psalm of praise.
**Direct statement:** God preserves those who love him; God destroys the wicked.
**Key observations:** The contrast is preserve vs. destroy. These are opposite outcomes. If "destroy" means "preserve in torment," the contrast collapses -- both groups would be preserved, just under different conditions. The plain meaning maintains the contrast: preservation vs. destruction.

#### Proverbs 11:7,10
**Text (v.7):** "When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish (abad): and the hope of unjust men perisheth."
**Text (v.10):** "When the wicked perish (abad), there is shouting."
**Direct statement:** When the wicked die, their expectation perishes. When the wicked perish, the city rejoices.
**Key observations:** Death and perishing are equated. The expectation that perishes is the future hope -- it ceases.

#### Job 4:9
**Text:** "By the blast of God they perish (abad), and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed."
**Context:** Eliphaz's observation about the wicked.
**Direct statement:** The wicked perish by God's blast and are consumed.
**Key observations:** Two parallel statements: perish and consumed. Both describe cessation.

#### Job 20:5-9
**Text:** "The triumphing of the wicked is short... Yet he shall perish (abad) for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found... The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him."
**Context:** Zophar's description of the wicked man's end.
**Direct statement:** The wicked man perishes forever. He is compared to dung (decomposing matter). He shall not be found. His place will not see him again.
**Key observations:** "Perish for ever" parallels Psa 92:7 ("destroyed for ever"). The similes -- dung, dream, something not found -- all depict cessation. "Where is he?" implies absence, not location in a torment zone.

#### Matthew 10:28 (apollymi)
**Text:** "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy (apollymi) both soul and body in hell (gehenna)."
**Context:** Jesus instructing the disciples about whom to fear.
**Direct statement:** God is able to destroy both soul and body in gehenna.
**Key observations:** The verb is apollymi (destroy), not basanizo (torment). The scope is "both soul and body" -- total destruction. Prior study etc-05 (E028) established this classification. This is the same apollymi that translates abad 141 times in the LXX.

#### John 3:16 (apollymi)
**Text:** "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish (apollymi), but have everlasting life."
**Context:** Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus.
**Direct statement:** The two outcomes are: perish or have everlasting life.
**Key observations:** The contrast is binary: perish vs. everlasting life. If "perish" means "exist forever in torment," then both outcomes involve everlasting existence, and the contrast between perishing and having everlasting life is obscured. The plain reading: those who believe have everlasting life; those who do not perish.

#### Luke 13:3,5 (apollymi)
**Text:** "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish (apollymi)."
**Context:** Jesus commenting on Galileans killed by Pilate and those killed when the tower of Siloam fell.
**Direct statement:** Without repentance, people will perish.
**Key observations:** Jesus uses apollymi in the context of physical death (Galileans killed, tower victims crushed). The word carries the same meaning when applied to eschatological fate.

#### Luke 17:27,29 (apollymi)
**Text:** "The flood came, and destroyed (apollymi) them all... it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed (apollymi) them all."
**Context:** Jesus comparing the last days to the days of Noah and Lot.
**Direct statement:** The flood destroyed them all. Fire and brimstone destroyed them all.
**Key observations:** The historical referents are clear: the flood killed everyone (they ceased to live), and fire and brimstone destroyed Sodom (the cities no longer exist). Jude 1:7 calls Sodom's destruction "the vengeance of eternal fire" -- yet the cities are not still burning. The destruction was completed; its result is permanent.

#### Romans 2:12 (apollymi)
**Text:** "For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish (apollymi) without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law."
**Context:** Paul's argument about impartial judgment.
**Direct statement:** Those who sin without the law will perish.
**Key observations:** Paul uses apollymi for the fate of sinners -- the same word used in John 3:16 and Matt 10:28.

#### 2 Peter 3:9 (apollymi)
**Text:** "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise... but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish (apollymi), but that all should come to repentance."
**Context:** Peter's discussion of the Day of the Lord.
**Direct statement:** God does not want anyone to perish. The alternative to perishing is repentance.
**Key observations:** Perishing is the opposite of repentance/salvation. In the same chapter (2 Pet 3:7), Peter says the present heavens and earth are "reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition (apoleia) of ungodly men."

#### 1 Corinthians 15:18 (apollymi)
**Text:** "Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished (apollymi)."
**Context:** Paul's argument for the necessity of the resurrection.
**Direct statement:** If Christ is not raised, the dead in Christ have perished.
**Key observations:** Paul's argument requires that "perished" means "ceased to exist" or "lost." If the dead believers were consciously alive somewhere, they would not have "perished" even without resurrection. Paul's argument only works if perishing = cessation.

### B. The shamad Passages

#### Psalm 37:38 (shamad)
**Text:** "But the transgressors shall be destroyed (shamad) together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off."
**Direct statement:** The transgressors are destroyed together. Their end is being cut off.
**Key observations:** "Cut off" -- removal from existence, not continued existence in another state.

#### Isaiah 13:9 (shamad)
**Text:** "Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy (shamad) the sinners thereof out of it."
**Context:** Oracle against Babylon.
**Direct statement:** On the day of the LORD, sinners are destroyed out of the land.
**Key observations:** "Destroy out of" implies removal/cessation, not relocation to a torment venue.

### C. The kalah Passages

#### Psalm 59:13 (kalah)
**Text:** "Consume (kalah) them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be."
**Direct statement:** David asks God to consume the wicked so they "may not be."
**Key observations:** The stated goal of consumption is non-existence: "that they may not be." This explicitly defines what kalah means in this context.

#### Psalm 104:35 (kalah)
**Text:** "Let the sinners be consumed (kalah) out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more."
**Direct statement:** Sinners consumed out of the earth. The wicked "be no more."
**Key observations:** "Be no more" defines the result of consumption: non-existence. Kalah and "be no more" are parallel expressions.

#### Isaiah 1:28,31 (kalah)
**Text (v.28):** "They that forsake the LORD shall be consumed (kalah)."
**Text (v.31):** "The strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them."
**Direct statement:** Those who forsake God are consumed. They burn like tow (flax fiber), which is consumed by fire.
**Key observations:** "None shall quench" means the fire cannot be extinguished before completing its work -- the same "unquenchable" language as Matt 3:12 and Mark 9:43. The tow is consumed by the fire, not preserved in it.

### D. The apoleia Passages

#### Matthew 7:13-14 (apoleia)
**Text:** "Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction (apoleia), and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it."
**Direct statement:** Two destinations: destruction and life.
**Key observations:** The contrast is destruction vs. life. This matches John 3:16 (perish vs. everlasting life). The destination of the broad way is apoleia -- destruction, the noun form of apollymi.

#### Philippians 3:18-19 (apoleia)
**Text:** "Whose end is destruction (apoleia), whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things."
**Context:** Paul contrasting enemies of the cross with believers.
**Direct statement:** The end of the enemies of the cross is destruction.
**Key observations:** The contrast (v.20-21) is between destruction and "our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour... who shall change our vile body." One group is destroyed; the other is glorified.

#### 2 Peter 3:7 (apoleia)
**Text:** "The heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition (apoleia) of ungodly men."
**Direct statement:** The present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, for the judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
**Key observations:** The destruction of the wicked is paralleled with the burning of the heavens and earth (v.10-12). The heavens and earth are destroyed by fire -- they do not endure in torment. Peter uses the same vocabulary for both.

#### 2 Peter 2:1,12 (apoleia)
**Text (v.1):** "Bring upon themselves swift destruction (apoleia)."
**Text (v.12):** "As natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed (phthora), speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish (phtheiro) in their own corruption."
**Direct statement:** The wicked bring swift destruction on themselves. They are compared to animals made to be caught and destroyed. They perish in their corruption.
**Key observations:** The animal comparison (2 Pet 2:12) is significant. Animals that are "taken and destroyed" cease to exist. Peter explicitly compares the fate of the wicked to this process. The verb phtheiro connects to the shachath -> diaphtheiro/phtheiro LXX chain.

### E. The olethros Passages

#### 2 Thessalonians 1:9 (olethros)
**Text:** "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction (olethros aionios) from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power."
**Context:** Paul describing what happens when the Lord returns in flaming fire.
**Direct statement:** The punishment is "everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord."
**Key observations:** The word is olethros (destruction, ruin, death), modified by aionios (everlasting). Olethros does not mean "torment" in any of its four NT uses or in its etymology (from ollymi, "to destroy"). "Everlasting destruction" lexically means destruction that is permanent -- its result endures forever. The phrase "from the presence of the Lord" can be parsed as source ("proceeding from") or separation ("away from"). Both parsings yield destruction, not torment.

#### 1 Thessalonians 5:3 (olethros)
**Text:** "Then sudden destruction (olethros) cometh upon them... and they shall not escape."
**Direct statement:** Sudden destruction comes; there is no escape.
**Key observations:** "Sudden" modifies olethros -- the destruction is swift, not drawn out. Combined with "shall not escape," this describes a completed catastrophe.

#### 1 Timothy 6:9 (olethros + apoleia)
**Text:** "Foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction (olethros) and perdition (apoleia)."
**Direct statement:** Two destruction words used together: olethros and apoleia.
**Key observations:** Paul pairs two words from the same destruction word family. The metaphor is "drown" -- submersion that leads to death. Neither word adds a torment dimension.

---

## IV. The "Perish vs. Life" Contrast Pattern

A recurring structural pattern emerges across both testaments: the fate of the righteous is described as "life" and the fate of the wicked is described using destruction vocabulary. These are presented as antithetical pairs:

| Passage | Righteous Outcome | Wicked Outcome | Words Used |
|---------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| John 3:16 | everlasting life | perish (apollymi) | G622 |
| Matt 7:13-14 | life | destruction (apoleia) | G684 |
| Rom 6:23 | eternal life | death (thanatos) | G2288 |
| Gal 6:8 | everlasting life | corruption (phthora) | G5356 |
| Phil 3:19-21 | glorified body | destruction (apoleia) | G684 |
| Psa 1:3-6 | like a fruitful tree | like chaff; perish (abad) | H6 |
| Psa 37:9-20 | inherit the earth | shall not be; consume to smoke (abad, kalah) | H6, H3615 |
| Psa 92:7-8 | LORD most high forever | destroyed forever (shamad) | H8045 |
| Psa 145:20 | preserved | destroyed (shamad) | H8045 |
| Pro 11:7 | (implicit) | expectation perishes (abad) | H6 |
| Mal 4:1-3 | healing, growth | stubble burned up; ashes | N/A (simile) |
| Matt 18:9; Mk 9:43,45,47 | enter into life | gehenna (fire) | N/A |
| 2 Thess 1:9 | glorified with Christ (v.10) | everlasting destruction (olethros) | G3639 |
| Heb 10:39 | saving of the soul | perdition (apoleia) | G684 |
| 2 Pet 2:12 | (implicit) | utterly perish in corruption (phtheiro) | G5351 |

In every instance, the righteous receive life/preservation/glory, and the wicked receive destruction/perishing/consumption. If "perish" and "destroy" mean "ongoing conscious existence in torment," the contrast between life and destruction collapses, because both groups would have ongoing existence. The contrast is maintained only if destruction vocabulary means what it says: the subject ceases to exist.

---

## V. Destruction Similes: What Do the Images Depict?

Scripture compares the fate of the wicked to a series of natural processes. Each simile depicts a substance that is consumed, dissipated, or ceases to exist:

### 1. Chaff (Psa 1:4; Job 21:18; Matt 3:12; Luke 3:17)
Chaff is the husk separated from grain. When winnowed, it is blown away by the wind (Psa 1:4) or burned (Matt 3:12: "burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire"). Chaff does not endure; it is consumed. "Burn up" (katakaiO, G2618) means to burn completely.

### 2. Wax melting before fire (Psa 68:2)
Wax placed before fire melts and ceases to be wax. The wicked "perish at the presence of God" as wax melts. The melting is a process with a terminal point: the wax is gone.

### 3. Smoke (Psa 37:20; 68:2; Hos 13:3)
Smoke is driven away and dissipates. "Into smoke shall they consume away" (Psa 37:20). Smoke is a byproduct of combustion that vanishes. It does not endure; it disperses and is gone.

### 4. Fat of lambs consumed (Psa 37:20)
Fat placed in fire is consumed -- it is used up in the burning process. The enemies of the LORD "shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume."

### 5. Stubble (Job 21:18; Mal 4:1; Nah 1:10; Isa 33:11)
Stubble is the dry stalks left after harvest. When burned, stubble is consumed rapidly and completely. "The day that cometh shall burn them up... it shall leave them neither root nor branch" (Mal 4:1). "Devoured as stubble fully dry" (Nah 1:10).

### 6. Ashes under feet (Mal 4:3)
"Ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet." Ashes are what remains after burning. The wicked are not depicted as existing in fire but as the residue after fire has completed its work. Ashes are inert, dead matter.

### 7. Morning clouds and early dew (Hos 13:3)
"As the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away." Both images depict things that appear briefly and then vanish. They do not endure.

### 8. Moth-eaten garments (Isa 50:9; 51:8)
Garments consumed by moths disintegrate over time until nothing remains. The process is consumption to nothing.

### 9. Thorns burned in fire (Psa 118:12; Isa 33:12)
"As thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire" (Isa 33:12). Thorns are combustible material that is quickly consumed.

### 10. Grass that withers (Psa 37:2; 92:7)
"When the wicked spring as the grass... it is that they shall be destroyed for ever" (Psa 92:7). Grass springs up quickly, withers, and dies. It does not endure.

**Common feature of all similes:** Every comparison depicts a substance that is consumed, dissipated, or ceases to exist through a natural process (burning, melting, evaporating, decomposing, withering). Not one simile depicts a substance that endures indefinitely in a state of suffering. The similes uniformly depict the END of the subject, not its ongoing preservation.

## VI. Eschatological Usage Patterns

### A. Frequency Analysis

The Bible uses destruction vocabulary far more frequently than torment vocabulary when describing the fate of the wicked:

- abad/apollymi/apoleia chain: ~296 combined occurrences (H6: 184 + G622: 92 + G684: 20)
- shamad: ~90 occurrences
- kalah: ~206 occurrences (many non-eschatological)
- shachath: ~147 occurrences (many non-eschatological)
- olethros: 4 occurrences

Torment vocabulary:
- basanizo (G928): 12 occurrences (various meanings: sickness, waves, moral distress, eschatological torment)
- basanismos (G929): 6 occurrences (all in Revelation)
- kolasis (G2851): 2 occurrences (Matt 25:46; 1 John 4:18)

The destruction vocabulary outnumbers the torment vocabulary by roughly 30:1 in occurrence frequency.

### B. Who Uses Destruction Vocabulary?

The destruction vocabulary is used by virtually every biblical author who addresses the fate of the wicked:
- Moses (Deut 4:26; 6:15; 8:19-20; 28:20,48,51,63; 30:18; 32:22-23)
- David (Psa 1:6; 37:20,38; 68:2; 145:20)
- Asaph (Psa 73:19,27)
- Other psalmists (Psa 59:13; 92:7-9; 104:35)
- Solomon/Wisdom (Pro 11:7,10; 28:28)
- Isaiah (Isa 1:28; 13:9; 26:14; 33:11-12; 66:24)
- Jeremiah (Jer 14:12; 51:18)
- Hosea (Hos 13:3)
- Malachi (Mal 4:1-3)
- Nahum (Nah 1:8-10)
- Obadiah (Oba 1:16)
- Jesus (Matt 5:29-30; 7:13; 10:28; Luke 13:3,5; 17:27,29; John 3:16)

### C. How the ECT Position Handles Destruction Vocabulary

The ECT (eternal conscious torment) interpretation reads destruction vocabulary as metaphorical for spiritual ruin rather than physical annihilation. On this reading, "perish" means "ruined" (continued existence in a ruined state), "destroy" means "inflict irreparable loss" (not end existence), and "consume" means "bring under judgment" (not consume to nothing).

This reading requires:
1. That apollymi in Matt 10:28 (destroy soul and body) does not mean what the LXX correspondence with abad would suggest
2. That the life/destruction contrast (John 3:16; Matt 7:13-14) does not present two opposite outcomes but two forms of continued existence
3. That every destruction simile (chaff, wax, smoke, ashes, stubble) depicts something other than what the natural process actually involves
4. That the Rev 14:10-11 and Rev 20:10 torment passages, which are in an apocalyptic genre and specify limited subjects, govern the reading of the destruction vocabulary used across both testaments by virtually every biblical author

## VII. The Torment Passages and Their Relationship to Destruction Vocabulary

### Revelation 14:10-11
**Text:** "He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone... and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image."
**Context:** Apocalyptic vision; the third angel's warning about beast-worshippers.
**Key observations:** (1) Genre is apocalyptic. (2) The subjects are beast-worshippers -- figures within the apocalyptic narrative. (3) "The smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" -- Isaiah 34:10 uses identical language for Edom: "the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste." Edom is not still burning. The "smoke ascending forever" is an image of completed destruction whose evidence (smoke) remains visible. (4) This is the only passage using basanizo (torment) applied to human-like subjects in an eschatological context, and it is in Revelation's apocalyptic genre.

### Revelation 20:10
**Text:** "The devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
**Key observations:** As established in etc-05 (E125, E204, E205), the three subjects are the devil, the beast, and the false prophet. The beast and false prophet are symbolic entities. When humans enter the lake of fire (Rev 20:15; 21:8), the text identifies their fate as "the second death," not "torment."

### Matthew 25:41,46
**Text (v.41):** "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."
**Text (v.46):** "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment (kolasis aionios): but the righteous into life eternal (zoe aionios)."
**Key observations:** (1) The fire was "prepared for the devil and his angels," not originally for humans. (2) Kolasis means "punishment," not "torment." (3) "Everlasting punishment" parallels "everlasting destruction" (2 Thess 1:9): the adjective aionios modifies the noun. Everlasting punishment can mean punishment whose result is everlasting (i.e., permanent destruction), just as "everlasting salvation" (Heb 5:9) means salvation whose result is everlasting. (4) The contrast is punishment vs. life -- the same pattern as perish vs. life.

### Mark 9:43-48
As established in etc-05 (E127, E192), Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24, which describes "carcases" (peger = dead bodies/corpses) acted upon by worm and fire. The worm (skolex/tola'ath = maggot) is an agent of decomposition. The fire acts on the dead. The gehenna vocabulary in this passage is destruction vocabulary, not torment vocabulary.

## VIII. Difficult Passages

### "Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth" (Matt 13:42,50; 8:12; 22:13; 25:30)
These phrases appear in contexts of being "cast into a furnace of fire" (Matt 13:42,50) or cast into "outer darkness" (Matt 8:12; 22:13; 25:30). The wailing and gnashing occur at the point of judgment -- the moment of being cast out. They do not necessarily describe an ongoing state. A person thrown into a furnace wails as they are consumed, not forever. The furnace imagery aligns with the destruction similes (chaff burned, tares burned).

### Daniel 12:2 -- "Everlasting Contempt"
**Text:** "Some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."
**Key observations:** The Hebrew deraon (H1860, contempt/abhorrence) occurs only twice in the OT: here and in Isa 66:24 (where it describes the reaction of onlookers to "carcases"). It is the onlookers who feel contempt, not the subjects who feel torment. "Everlasting contempt" describes how the destroyed are regarded forever, not that they exist forever.

### Isaiah 33:14 -- "Everlasting Burnings"
**Text:** "Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?"
**Context:** In context (v.11-12), the people are "the burnings of lime" and "thorns cut up burned in the fire." Lime and thorns are consumed by fire. The "everlasting burnings" describe the fire's character (it is God's consuming fire, Heb 12:29), not the endurance of its subjects.

## IX. Cross-Study Integration

### Connection to etc-01 (What Is Man?)
That study established: man became a living soul (Gen 2:7, E003), nephesh can die (Ezek 18:4,20, E016), God can destroy soul and body in gehenna (Matt 10:28, E028), thoughts perish (abad) at death (Ps 146:4, E011). The destruction vocabulary study confirms that abad in Ps 146:4 belongs to a massive word family (~743 occurrences) consistently meaning cessation.

### Connection to etc-02 (Who Has Immortality?)
That study established: God alone has immortality (1 Tim 6:16, E024), immortality is put on at resurrection (1 Cor 15:53-54, E026), the wages of sin is death (Rom 6:23, E087). The destruction vocabulary study confirms that the destruction words used for the fate of the wicked belong to the death/cessation semantic field, not the torment semantic field.

### Connection to etc-03 (Biblical Death)
That study established: death reverses creation (N006), the second death is the lake of fire (E123, E124), everlasting destruction (2 Thess 1:9, E090). The destruction vocabulary study provides the full lexical context for "everlasting destruction" -- olethros means "destruction/ruin" in all four uses, and the abad-apollymi chain behind it carries ~296 occurrences of cessation vocabulary.

### Connection to etc-05 (Four Hell Words)
That study established: gehenna uses apollymi, not basanizo (E197); Isaiah 66:24 describes corpses (E192); "enter into life" vs. gehenna (E190). The destruction vocabulary study confirms that apollymi belongs to a chain of destruction words (abad -> apollymi -> apoleia, G622 -> G684) that consistently describe cessation, not torment.
