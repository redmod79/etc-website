## Question
What words does the Bible use to describe the fate of the wicked? Examining the primary Hebrew and Greek destruction vocabulary: apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora, and Hebrew abad, shamad, kalah, karat. Do these words describe ongoing conscious torment or cessation of existence?

---

## Section 1: Primary Greek Destruction Vocabulary — apollumi (G622)

### Matthew 7:13-14 (apoleia — destruction; gate leading to life vs. destruction)
> **7:13** Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide [is] the gate, and broad [is] the way, that leadeth to **destruction** [apōleian], and many there be which go in thereat:
> **7:14** Because strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth unto **life** [zōēn], and few there be that find it.

**Key:** Two paths — one leads to *destruction* (apoleia), one leads to *life* (zoe). These are presented as antithetical outcomes.

---

### Matthew 10:28 (apollumi — destroy both soul and body in gehenna)
> **10:25** It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more [shall they call] them of his household?
> **10:26** Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
> **10:27** What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, [that] preach ye upon the housetops.
> **10:28** And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is **able to destroy** [apolesai] **both soul and body in hell** [gehenna].
> **10:29** Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

**Key:** God's power goes beyond human killers (who can only kill the body) — he can *destroy* (apollumi, aorist active infinitive) BOTH soul AND body in gehenna. The verb is apollumi, not basanizō.

---

### Matthew 18:14 (apollumi — not willing that one should perish)
> **18:10** Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
> **18:11** For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost [apolloluos — G622].
> **18:12** How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
> **18:13** And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that [sheep], than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.
> **18:14** Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that **one of these little ones should perish** [apolētai — G622].

**Key:** God's will is that none should *perish* (apollumi). The rescued sheep were "lost" (apollumi) — the same word. Salvation is rescue from perishing.

---

### Luke 13:3,5 (apollumi — ye shall likewise perish)
> **13:1** There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
> **13:2** And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?
> **13:3** I tell you, Nay: but, **except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish** [apoloisthe — G622].
> **13:4** Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?
> **13:5** I tell you, Nay: but, **except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish** [apoloisthe — G622].

**Key:** Perishing (apollumi) is presented as the eschatological consequence of unrepentance. Repeated twice for emphasis. The word is apollumi — destroy/perish — not torment vocabulary.

---

### John 3:15-16 (apollumi — should not perish, but have everlasting life)
> **3:14** And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
> **3:15** That whosoever believeth in him **should not perish** [apollētai], but have eternal life.
> **3:16** For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him **should not perish** [apollētai — G622], **but have everlasting life** [zōēn aiōnion].
> **3:17** For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
> **3:18** He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

**Key:** The classic verse. Two contrasted outcomes: (1) **perish** (apollumi — G622, aorist middle subjunctive: a decisive, complete event) vs. (2) **have everlasting life** (zoe aionios). The antithesis is between perishing and having life — not between two forms of ongoing existence.

---

### John 10:28 (apollumi — they shall never perish)
> **10:26** But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
> **10:27** My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
> **10:28** And I give unto them eternal life; and **they shall never perish** [ou mē apolōntai — G622], neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand.
> **10:29** My Father, which gave [them] me, is greater than all; and no [man] is able to pluck [them] out of my Father's hand.

**Key:** Security of believers stated as "they shall never perish" (ou mē apolōntai — strong double negative: "shall by no means perish"). The negative of what unbelievers face.

---

### Acts 8:20 (apollumi — thy money perish with thee)
> **8:19** Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
> **8:20** But Peter said unto him, **Thy money perish** [apollumi] **with thee**, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
> **8:21** Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
> **8:22** Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.

**Key:** Apollumi used as an imprecation (curse/wish): "perish with thee." Contextually refers to ruin/destruction, not torture.

---

### Romans 2:12 (apollumi — shall also perish without law)
> **2:11** For there is no respect of persons with God.
> **2:12** For as many as have sinned without law **shall also perish** [apolountai — G622] without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
> **2:13** (For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.

**Key:** Those who sinned without law shall "perish" (apollumi) without law. The Gentiles face perishing just as the Jews face judgment. Apollumi parallels judgment as the outcome of sin.

---

### 1 Corinthians 1:18 (apollumi — them that are perishing)
> **1:17** For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
> **1:18** For the preaching of the cross is to **them that perish** [apollumenois — G622, pres. mid/pass. ptcp.] foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
> **1:19** For it is written, I will destroy [apollumi] the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

**Key:** Present middle/passive participle "apollumenois" — "those who are perishing" (ongoing process of being in the state of moving toward destruction). Contrast with "us who are saved." Two categories: perishing vs. saved.

---

### 1 Corinthians 15:18 (apollumi — the dead in Christ are perished)
> **15:15** Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
> **15:16** For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
> **15:17** And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins.
> **15:18** Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ **are perished** [apolonto — G622, aorist middle indicative, 3rd pl].
> **15:19** If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
> **15:20** But now is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept.

**Key:** If resurrection is not true, those who died in Christ "have perished" (apollumi — aorist middle indicative: completed destruction). Paul treats their destruction (perishing) as the opposite of the resurrection hope. Destruction = the absence of resurrection life.

---

### 2 Corinthians 2:15 (apollumi — them that are perishing)
> **2:14** Now thanks [be] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
> **2:15** For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and **in them that perish** [apollumenois — G622]:
> **2:16** To the one [we are] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life.

**Key:** Two categories: the saved and the perishing (apollumenois). To those perishing, the gospel is "savour of death unto death." The end is death (not life in torment).

---

### 2 Corinthians 4:3 (apollumi — gospel hid to them that are lost)
> **4:1** Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
> **4:2** But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
> **4:3** But if our gospel be hid, it is hid **to them that are lost** [apollumenois — G622]:
> **4:4** In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

**Key:** "Lost" = apollumenois (perishing ones) — same present participle as 1 Cor 1:18 and 2 Cor 2:15.

---

### 2 Thessalonians 2:10 (apollumi — them that are perishing)
> **2:8** And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:
> **2:9** [Even him], whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
> **2:10** And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness **in them that perish** [apollumenois — G622]; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
> **2:11** And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:

**Key:** Those perishing (apollumenois) are deceived because they did not receive the love of the truth. Perishing is the result of rejecting salvation.

---

### Hebrews 1:11 (apollumi — heavens shall perish)
> **1:10** And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
> **1:11** **They shall perish** [apolountai — G622]; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
> **1:12** And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

**Key:** The heavens themselves shall "perish" (apollumi). Used for inanimate creation. Confirms that apollumi means actual ceasing to exist/perishing, not ongoing conscious torment.

---

### 2 Peter 3:9 (apollumi — not willing that any should perish)
> **3:8** But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is] with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
> **3:9** The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, **not willing that any should perish** [apolesthai — G622], but that all should come to repentance.
> **3:10** But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.

**Key:** God does not want any to "perish" (apolesthai — aorist middle infinitive of apollumi). The contrast is with repentance. The alternative to repentance is perishing (apollumi), not torment.

---

## Section 2: Primary Greek Destruction Vocabulary — apoleia (G684)

### Matthew 7:13 (apoleia — broad road to destruction)
[Text given in Section 1 above — apoleia appears here as "destruction" contrasted with "life"]

---

### Philippians 3:18-19 (apoleia — whose end is destruction)
> **3:17** Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
> **3:18** (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:
> **3:19** **Whose end [is] destruction** [apoleia — G684], whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
> **3:20** For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

**Key:** The enemies of the cross have apoleia as their telos (end/outcome). Greek parsing: "ὧν τὸ τέλος ἀπώλεια" — predicate nominative with no verb: "their end IS destruction."

---

### 2 Peter 2:1-3 (apoleia — swift destruction; damnation)
> **2:1** But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves **swift destruction** [apoleia — G684].
> **2:2** And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
> **2:3** And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and **their damnation** [apoleia — G684] **slumbereth not**.

**Key:** Apoleia used twice for false teachers: "swift destruction" (v.1) and "damnation" (v.2). KJV translates the same word (apoleia) as both "destruction" and "damnation."

---

### 2 Thessalonians 2:3 (apoleia — son of perdition)
> **2:1** Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and [by] our gathering together unto him,
> **2:2** That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.
> **2:3** Let no man deceive you by any means: for [that day shall not come], except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, **the son of perdition** [huios tēs apōleias — G684];

**Key:** The Antichrist is called "son of destruction/perdition" — apoleia as a characterization of his ultimate end/nature.

---

### Revelation 17:8,11 (apoleia — the beast goeth into perdition)
> **17:7** And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
> **17:8** The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and **go into perdition** [eis apōleian — G684]: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
> **17:9** And here [is] the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
> **17:10** And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, [and] the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
> **17:11** And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and **goeth into perdition** [eis apōleian — G684].

**Key:** The beast's destiny is twice described as "going into perdition/destruction" (apoleia). Compare with Rev 20:10 where the devil is cast into the lake of fire.

---

### Hebrews 10:37-39 (apoleia — perdition vs. saving of the soul)
> **10:37** For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
> **10:38** Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
> **10:39** But we are not of them who draw back unto **perdition** [apōleian — G684]; but of them that believe to the **saving of the soul** [peripoiēsin psuchēs].

**Key:** Perdition (apoleia) contrasted with "saving of the soul" — the soul can either be saved (peripoiesis) or lost to perdition (apoleia).

---

### 1 Timothy 6:9 (olethros + apoleia — destruction and perdition)
> **6:8** And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
> **6:9** But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in **destruction and perdition** [olethron kai apōleian — G3639 + G684].
> **6:10** For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

**Key:** Both olethros AND apoleia used together — "destruction and perdition." The two terms are near-synonymous or complementary. Neither implies torment; both denote ruin/destruction.

---

### Romans 9:22 (apoleia — vessels of wrath fitted to destruction)
> **9:21** Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
> **9:22** [What] if God, willing to shew [his] wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath **fitted to destruction** [katērtismena eis apōleian — G684]:
> **9:23** And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

**Key:** The "vessels of wrath" are fitted (katērtismena — perfect passive participle: already prepared) for "destruction" (apoleia). Contrasted with vessels of mercy prepared for glory.

---

## Section 3: Additional Greek Terms — olethros (G3639) and phthora (G5356)

### 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10 (olethros — everlasting destruction)
> **1:5** [Which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
> **1:6** Seeing [it is] a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
> **1:7** And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
> **1:8** In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
> **1:9** Who shall be punished with **everlasting destruction** [olethron aiōnion — G3639+G166] from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
> **1:10** When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.

**Key:** "Everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion). Greek parsing shows: olethros (G3639, n-m, accusative singular) + aionios (G166, adjective agreeing in gender/number). The aionios (eternal/age-lasting) modifier attaches to olethros (destruction), not to basanismos (torment). The phrase "from the presence of the Lord" (apo prosopou tou Kuriou) is key — the destruction comes FROM the Lord's presence.

---

### 1 Thessalonians 5:1-4 (olethros — sudden destruction)
> **5:1** But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
> **5:2** For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
> **5:3** For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then **sudden destruction** [aiphnidios olethros — G3639] **cometh upon them**, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
> **5:4** But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.

**Key:** "Sudden destruction" (aiphnidios olethros) — destruction that comes suddenly, unexpectedly. Like birth pangs. The suddenness and certainty of escape-proof destruction.

---

### 1 Corinthians 5:4-5 (olethros — destruction of the flesh)
> **5:4** In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
> **5:5** To deliver such an one unto Satan for the **destruction of the flesh** [olethron tēs sarkos — G3639], that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

**Key:** Olethros used for "destruction of the flesh" — a temporal punishment with a redemptive purpose. The body is destroyed (olethros), the spirit is saved. Olethros refers to physical/existential ruin.

---

### Galatians 6:7-8 (phthora — reap corruption)
> **6:7** Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
> **6:8** For he that soweth to his flesh shall **of the flesh reap corruption** [phthoran — G5356]; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting [zōēn aiōnion].

**Key:** Phthora (corruption/decay) contrasted with "life everlasting" (zoe aionios). Those who live for the flesh reap corruption (phthora); those who live for the Spirit reap life. Two opposed outcomes.

---

### 2 Peter 2:10-13 (phthora — utterly perish in their own corruption)
> **2:10** But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous [are they], selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
> **2:11** Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.
> **2:12** But these, **as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed** [phthoran — G5356], speak evil of the things that they understand not; and **shall utterly perish** [phtharēsontai — G5351] **in their own corruption** [phthora — G5356];
> **2:13** And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, [as] they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots [they are] and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;

**Key:** The false teachers are explicitly compared to animals "made to be taken and destroyed" — like prey animals whose purpose/end is destruction. The word phthora appears for both their nature ("made for destruction") and their fate ("shall utterly perish in their own corruption"). The comparison to animals is significant: animals don't experience eternal torment — they die.

---

### 2 Peter 1:3-4 (phthora — escaped the corruption in the world)
> **1:3** According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that [pertain] unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
> **1:4** Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be **partakers of the divine nature**, having **escaped the corruption** [phthoras — G5356] **that is in the world through lust**.

**Key:** The divine promises allow believers to escape phthora (corruption/decay). The world-system is in a state of phthora from which believers are rescued.

---

> **37:40** And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.

**Key destruction terms in Psalm 37:**
- v.2: cut down/wither (karat metaphor for grass)
- v.9: cut off (karat — H3772, Niphal Impf 3mp)
- v.10: "not be" / "he is not" (ain — non-existence particle, TWICE)
- v.20: perish (abad — H6, Qal Impf 3mp); consume/consumed (kalah — H3615, Qal Perf 3p, TWICE)
- v.22: cut off (karat)
- v.28: cut off (karat)
- v.34: cut off (karat)
- v.36: "he was not" (ain — non-existence)
- v.38: destroyed (shamad — H8045, Niphal Perf 3p); cut off (karat)

**Pattern:** Psalm 37 uses five different Hebrew destruction terms (karat, abad, kalah, shamad, ain) — all pointing to cessation of existence, not ongoing torment.

---

### Psalm 1:4-6 (abad — way of the ungodly shall perish)
> **1:4** The ungodly [are] not so: but [are] like the **chaff which the wind driveth away**.
> **1:5** Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
> **1:6** For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but **the way of the ungodly shall perish** [tobed — H6, abad].

**Key:** (1) Simile of chaff — wind-driven chaff disintegrates, scatters, ceases to exist. (2) The way of the ungodly shall "perish" (abad). The chaff simile interprets the perishing.

---

### Psalm 9:3-6 (abad — destroyed; name blotted out)
> **9:3** When mine enemies are turned back, they shall **fall and perish** [abad] at thy presence.
> **9:4** For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
> **9:5** Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast **destroyed** [abad] the wicked, thou hast **put out their name for ever and ever**.
> **9:6** O thou enemy, **destructions are come to a perpetual end**: and thou hast **destroyed cities**; **their memorial is perished** [abad] **with them**.

**Key:** Three occurrences of abad in close proximity. Associated with: name blotted out permanently, memorial perished, destructions come to a perpetual end. The name/memorial being erased is an image of non-existence.

---

### Psalm 73:25-28 (abad — they that are far from thee shall perish)
> **73:25** Whom have I in heaven [but thee]? and [there is] none upon earth [that] I desire beside thee.
> **73:26** My flesh and my heart faileth: [but] God [is] the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
> **73:27** For, lo, **they that are far from thee shall perish** [yobedu — abad, Qal Impf 3mp]: thou hast **destroyed** all them that go a whoring from thee.
> **73:28** But [it is] good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

**Key:** Being far from God = perishing (abad). Drawing near to God = the alternative. The choice is proximity (salvation/life) vs. distance (perishing/destruction).

---

### Psalm 92:7-9 (shamad — destroyed for ever)
> **92:7** When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; [it is] that **they shall be destroyed for ever** [yishammedu ad-olam — shamad]:
> **92:8** But thou, LORD, [art most] high for evermore.
> **92:9** For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies **shall perish** [yobedu — abad]; all the workers of iniquity **shall be scattered**.

**Key:** "Destroyed for ever" (shamad + ad-olam = H8045 + "unto the age"). The permanence of the destruction. Paralleled with "shall perish" (abad) and "shall be scattered." The contrast is with God who is "most high for evermore" — His permanence vs. their destruction.

---

### Psalm 104:33-35 (tamam — sinners consumed; ain — wicked be no more)
> **104:33** I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
> **104:34** My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.
> **104:35** Let the sinners **be consumed** [yittamu — H8552, tamam] out of the earth, and let **the wicked be no more** [wicked + ain — non-existence]. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.

**Key:** "Be consumed" (tamam) + "be no more" (ain). The consumption is followed by non-existence. The sinners are to be consumed out of the earth — removed completely.

---

### Malachi 4:1-4 (stubble, fire, ashes — total combustion)
> **4:1** For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be **stubble**: and the day that cometh shall **burn them up**, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall **leave them neither root nor branch**.
> **4:2** But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.
> **4:3** And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be **ashes** [epher — H665] under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do [this], saith the LORD of hosts.
> **4:4** Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, [with] the statutes and judgments.

**Key:** Progressive destruction: (1) wicked = stubble; (2) fire burns them up completely; (3) leaves "neither root nor branch" — nothing remains; (4) they become ashes (epher) underfoot. This is total combustion — the most complete destruction imagery in the OT. Ashes cannot experience torment.

---

### Isaiah 65:10-15 (sword, slaughter — the fate of those who forsook God)
> **65:10** And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
> **65:11** But ye [are] they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.
> **65:12** Therefore will I number you to the sword, and **ye shall all bow down to the slaughter**: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose [that] wherein I delighted not.
> **65:13** Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but **ye shall be hungry**: behold, my servants shall drink, but **ye shall be thirsty**: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but **ye shall be ashamed**:
> **65:14** Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but **ye shall cry for sorrow of heart**, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
> **65:15** And **ye shall leave your name for a curse** unto my chosen: for the **Lord GOD shall slay thee**, and call his servants by another name:

**Key:** The contrast between the servants (blessed) and those who forsook God (slain). The fate of the forsakers is slaughter and death. Note: v.14 mentions "sorrow of heart and howl for vexation of spirit" — this is experienced BEFORE judgment/death, during the time of tribulation, not after.

---

### Isaiah 66:15-17,24 (fire, sword, consumed, carcases, worm)
> **66:14** And when ye see [this], your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and [his] indignation toward his enemies.
> **66:15** For, behold, the **LORD will come with fire**, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
> **66:16** For **by fire and by his sword** will the LORD plead with all flesh: and **the slain of the LORD shall be many**.
> **66:17** They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one [tree] in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, **shall be consumed together** [kalah — H3615], saith the LORD.
> **66:22** For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
> **66:23** And it shall come to pass, [that] from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
> **66:24** And they shall go forth, and look upon the **carcases** [pigre — H6297, corpses] of the men that have transgressed against me: for **their worm shall not die**, neither shall their **fire be quenched**; and they shall be an **abhorring** unto all flesh.

**Key on 66:24:** The source text for Mark 9:43-48. Critical observation:
- The Hebrew word is **pigre** (H6297) = corpses/carcasses — not living persons
- The worm and fire act on DEAD BODIES (corpses), not on conscious persons
- The "worm that does not die" and "fire not quenched" refers to continued action on the bodies — the imagery is of complete consumption of the dead
- This is the prophetic background that Jesus quotes in Mark 9 (gehenna)

---

### Nahum 1:7-11 (kalah — utter end; affliction not rise a second time)
> **1:7** The LORD [is] good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.
> **1:8** But with an overrunning flood he will make **an utter end** [kalah — H3617] of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
> **1:9** What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make **an utter end** [kalah — H3617]: **affliction shall not rise up the second time**.
> **1:10** For while [they be] folden together [as] thorns, and while they are drunken [as] drunkards, they shall be devoured as **stubble fully dry**.
> **1:11** There is [one] come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counseller.

**Key:** "Utter end" (kalah — noun form of H3615) used twice. The clinching phrase: "affliction shall not rise up the second time." The destruction is so complete that the threat cannot recur — the enemy has been completely eliminated.

---

### Obadiah 1:15-17 ("as though they had not been")
> **1:15** For the day of the LORD [is] near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.
> **1:16** For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, [so] shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and **they shall be as though they had not been** [lo hayah — "as if they had not existed"].
> **1:17** But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.

**Key:** "As though they had not been" (lo hayah — lit. "as if they did not exist") — the strongest possible statement of non-existence. The nations who drank God's wrath will be as if they had never existed. This is the eschatological goal of the destruction: non-existence.

---

### Ezekiel 28:17-19 ("never shalt thou be any more")
> **28:17** Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.
> **28:18** Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee **to ashes upon the earth** in the sight of all them that behold thee.
> **28:19** All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and **never [shalt] thou [be] any more** [lo tehyeh + lo — "not be, not"].

**Key:** The fire "from the midst" devours and reduces to ashes. Then the irrevocable statement: "never shalt thou be any more." This is addressed to the king of Tyre (and many see also a reference to Satan's ultimate fate). The Hebrew lo tehyeh = "thou shalt not be" — non-existence permanently.

---

### Daniel 2:42-45 (break in pieces and consume all kingdoms)
> **2:42** And [as] the toes of the feet [were] part of iron, and part of clay, [so] the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
> **2:43** And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
> **2:44** And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, [but] it shall **break in pieces and consume** all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.

**Key:** The divine kingdom will "break in pieces" (daqaq) and "consume" (soph) all other kingdoms. These are destruction terms — the kingdoms end. The divine kingdom stands in contrast: eternal. The earthly kingdoms: consumed.

---

### Daniel 12:1-3 (everlasting life vs. everlasting contempt)
> **12:1** And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation [even] to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
> **12:2** And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, **some to everlasting life** [chayyim olam], **and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt** [deraon olam].
> **12:3** And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.

**Key:** The resurrection produces two outcomes: everlasting life vs. everlasting contempt (deraon olam). The Hebrew "deraon" (H1860) = disgust, abhorrence, contempt. Isaiah 66:24 uses the same word (deraon) for what the righteous will feel looking at the carcasses. Note: the term is "contempt" not "torment" — it describes the regard of others for those who are judged, not necessarily their experience.

---

## Section 5: Life/Death Contrast Passages

### Romans 6:21-23 (wages of sin = death; gift of God = eternal life)
> **6:21** What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death.
> **6:22** But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
> **6:23** For **the wages of sin [is] death** [thanatos — G2288]; but **the gift of God [is] eternal life** [zōē aiōnios — G2222] through Jesus Christ our Lord.

**Key:** The fundamental antithesis: death vs. life. The consequence of sin is death (thanatos) — not torment. The antidote is eternal life (zoe aionios). Paul's entire soteriology is structured around life vs. death, not comfort vs. torment.

---

### John 5:22-25 (passed from death unto life)
> **5:22** For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:
> **5:23** That all [men] should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.
> **5:24** Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, **hath everlasting life** [zōēn aiōnion], and shall not come into condemnation; but is **passed from death unto life** [metabebēken ek tou thanatou eis tēn zōēn].
> **5:25** Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.

**Key:** Believers have "passed from death into life" — the transition is between two ontological states: death and life. The unbeliever remains in the state of death.

---

### John 10:9-11 (I am come that they might have life)
> **10:9** I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
> **10:10** The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to **destroy** [apollumi — G622]: I am come that they might have **life** [zōē], and that they might have [it] more abundantly.
> **10:11** I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

**Key:** Jesus's mission is explicitly about life (zoe). The enemy's mission is apollumi (destruction). These are the two poles: destruction vs. abundant life.

---

### 1 John 5:9-13 (life is in the Son; without Son = no life)
> **5:9** If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.
> **5:10** He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
> **5:11** And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life [zōēn aiōnion], and **this life is in his Son**.
> **5:12** **He that hath the Son hath life** [zōē]; **[and] he that hath not the Son of God hath not life** [zōē].
> **5:13** These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

**Key:** Life (zoe) is in the Son. Those without the Son "have not life" — they have no life, not a different kind of existence. The antithesis is life vs. no-life, not life vs. torment-life.

---

### Revelation 22:1-3 (tree of life)
> **22:1** And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
> **22:2** In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, [was there] the **tree of life** [xylon zōēs], which bare twelve [manner of] fruits, [and] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations.
> **22:3** And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:

**Key:** The tree of life (xylon zoes) in the new creation. Compare Rev 2:7: "to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life." The tree of life gives what the wicked are denied — life (zoe). The wicked are denied access (Rev 22:14-15), and without access to the tree of life, they have no life.

---

## Section 6: ECT-Supporting Passages (Ongoing Torment Language)

### Revelation 14:9-12 (tormented with fire and brimstone; smoke ascendeth forever)
> **14:8** And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
> **14:9** And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
> **14:10** The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and **he shall be tormented** [basanisthēsetai — G928] **with fire and brimstone** in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
> **14:11** And **the smoke of their torment** [basanismou — G929] **ascendeth up for ever and ever** [eis aiōnas aiōnōn]: and **they have no rest day nor night**, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
> **14:12** Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

**Key for ECT interpretation:**
- "Tormented" (basanisthēsetai — future passive indicative of G928)
- "Smoke of their torment" (basanismou — G929)
- "Ascendeth up for ever and ever" (eis aiōnas aiōnōn)
- "No rest day nor night" — for those worshipping the beast
- The subject: specifically "who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name"
- Greek: "ἀναβαίνει" (anabainei) — present indicative (smoke rises continuously)

**Note for analysis:** This is the primary ECT passage using basanismos/basanizo vocabulary. The subject is beast-worshippers specifically. Whether this extends to all the wicked is the key analytical question.

---

### Revelation 20:7-11 (tormented day and night forever — devil, beast, false prophet)
> **20:7** And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
> **20:8** And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea.
> **20:9** And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and **fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them**.
> **20:10** And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and **shall be tormented** [basanisthēsontai — G928] **day and night for ever and ever** [eis tous aiōnas tōn aiōnōn].
> **20:11** And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.

**Key:**
- v.9: "fire devoured them" — the nations surrounding the city are devoured (consumed) by fire
- v.10: the devil, beast, false prophet are "tormented day and night for ever and ever"
- The three named entities (devil, beast, false prophet) are the subject of the torment language
- The nations in v.9 are "devoured" (katephagen — consumed) — different vocabulary from the three entities

**Note for analysis:** Two different fates described in close proximity: (a) nations = devoured/consumed; (b) devil/beast/false prophet = tormented forever. This may suggest different outcomes for different subjects.

---

### Matthew 25:41-46 (everlasting punishment vs. everlasting life)
> **25:41** Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, **Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire** [pyr aiōnion], prepared for the devil and his angels:
> **25:42** For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
> **25:43** I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
> **25:44** Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
> **25:45** Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it] not to me.
> **25:46** And these shall go away into **everlasting punishment** [kolasin aiōnion — G2851], but the righteous into **life eternal** [zōēn aiōnion — G2222].

**Key:**
- "Everlasting fire" (pyr aiōnion) — the fire is eternal, but what does fire DO? Fire consumes
- "Everlasting punishment" (kolasin aiōnion — G2851)
- "Life eternal" (zōēn aiōnion — G2222)
- Same adjective (aiōnion) on both punishment and life — the duration/quality applies equally
- kolasis (G2851): penal infliction, punishment — derived from kolazo (to prune, curtail, chastise)
- Note: the term is kolasis (punishment), NOT olethros (destruction) — this is punishment vocabulary, not destruction vocabulary
- The fire is prepared for the devil and his angels — the fire's origin relates to the supernatural entities

---

### Mark 9:41-48 (where their worm dieth not, fire not quenched)
> **9:41** For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.
> **9:42** And whosoever shall offend one of [these] little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
> **9:43** And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to **enter into life** [zōēn] **maimed**, than having two hands to go into **hell** [geennan], into the fire that never shall be quenched:
> **9:44** **Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched**.
> **9:45** And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into **life** [zōēn], than having two feet to be cast into **hell** [geennan], into the fire that never shall be quenched:
> **9:46** **Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched**.
> **9:47** And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into **hell fire** [geennan tou pyros]:
> **9:48** **Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched**.

**Key:**
- The threefold refrain quotes Isaiah 66:24 exactly
- Isa 66:24: the worm and fire act on CORPSES (pigre/carcasses) — the dead
- The undying worm and unquenched fire = the agents of thorough consumption never stop working (until their work is complete)
- Contrast with "life" (zoe) — three times gehenna is the alternative to "entering life"
- The worm and fire are destruction agents (consuming), not torture agents for conscious beings

---

### Isaiah 66:24 (carcases — worm, fire, abhorring)
[Given above in Section 4 — repeated here for ECT context]

> **66:24** And they shall go forth, and look upon the **carcases** [pigre] of the men that have transgressed against me: for **their worm shall not die**, neither shall **their fire be quenched**; and they shall be an **abhorring** [deraon — same word as Dan 12:2 "contempt"] unto all flesh.

**Key:** The Hebrew term is pigre (H6297) = corpses. The worm and fire act on corpses. The "abhorring" (deraon) = the emotion felt by observers, not the experience of the dead.

---

### Daniel 12:2 (everlasting life vs. shame and everlasting contempt)
[Given above in Section 4 — repeated here]

> **12:2** And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, **some to everlasting life** [chayyim olam], **and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt** [deraon olam].

**Key:** The Hebrew term for the wicked's fate is "deraon" (contempt/abhorrence) not "torment." Deraon is what others feel toward the wicked (contempt), not a description of conscious experience. However, "shame" (bosheth) alongside it implies some level of conscious experience is involved in the resurrection judgment.

---

## Section 7: Additional Context Passages

### Isaiah 26:13-15 (deceased shall not rise — non-resurrection of the wicked)
> **26:13** O LORD our God, [other] lords beside thee have had dominion over us: [but] by thee only will we make mention of thy name.
> **26:14** [They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and **destroyed** [abad] **them**, and **made all their memory to perish** [abad].
> **26:15** Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed [it] far [unto] all the ends of the earth.

**Key:** "They shall not live; they shall not rise" — contrasting with the righteous of v.19 who shall rise. The wicked (other lords) are destroyed and their memory perishes (abad). The text asserts non-resurrection for the "other lords" (opposing entities). This requires careful contextual analysis.

---

### Isaiah 41:9-12 (wicked as nothing — non-existence language)
> **41:9** [Thou] whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou [art] my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.
> **41:10** Fear thou not; for I [am] with thee: be not dismayed; for I [am] thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.
> **41:11** Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be **ashamed and confounded**: they shall be **as nothing** [ka-ayin — like nothing/non-existence]; and they that strive with thee shall **perish** [abad].
> **41:12** Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, [even] them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be **as nothing** [ka-ayin], and **as a thing of nought** [ka-ephes — as zero/nothing].

**Key:** "As nothing" (ka-ayin) and "as a thing of nought" (ka-ephes) — the enemies of God's servant shall become as non-existent. You "shall not find them" — non-existence language in eschatological context.

---

### Hosea 13:1-3 (morning cloud, dew, chaff, smoke — vanishing imagery)
> **13:1** When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.
> **13:2** And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, [and] idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.
> **13:3** Therefore they shall be **as the morning cloud**, and **as the early dew that passeth away**, as the **chaff [that] is driven with the whirlwind** out of the floor, and **as the smoke out of the chimney**.

**Key:** Four images of complete vanishing: morning cloud (evaporates), early dew (evaporates), chaff driven by wind (disperses), smoke from chimney (disappears). None of these images suggest ongoing torment — all depict vanishing/cessation.

### Isaiah 47:12-14 (fire burns as stubble — no coal remaining)
> **47:12** Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.
> **47:13** Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from [these things] that shall come upon thee.
> **47:14** Behold, they shall be **as stubble**; **the fire shall burn them**; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: **[there shall] not [be] a coal to warm at**, [nor] fire to sit before it.

**Key:** Stubble metaphor — completely consumed by fire. The result: not even a coal left. Nothing remains with which to warm oneself. Total consumption.

### Psalm 68:1-3 (wicked perish like melting wax/driven smoke)
> **68:1** To the chief Musician, A Psalm [or] Song of David. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.
> **68:2** **As smoke is driven away**, [so] drive [them] away: **as wax melteth before the fire**, so let **the wicked perish** [yobedu — abad] at the presence of God.
> **68:3** But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

**Key:** Two destruction images: (1) smoke driven away — disperses completely; (2) wax melting — dissolves, loses form, ceases to exist as wax. These images interpret the word "perish" (abad).

### Hebrews 10:25-31 (fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation)
> **10:25** Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is]; but exhorting [one another]: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
> **10:26** For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
> **10:27** But a certain **fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries**.
> **10:28** He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
> **10:29** Of how much sorer **punishment** [timoria — G5098], suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
> **10:30** For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth] unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
> **10:31** [It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

**Key:** "Fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries" — devour language (consumption). Punishment (timoria) awaits apostates. The punishment is described as God's judgment — not specified whether ongoing torment or destruction.

### Revelation 20:14-15 and 21:7-8 (second death, lake of fire)
> **20:14** And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is **the second death**.
> **20:15** And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
> **21:7** He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
> **21:8** But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is **the second death**.

**Key:** The lake of fire IS the second death (Rev 20:14; 21:8). Death = the opposite of life. Second death = final/irreversible death, separating from the first death which is reversible by resurrection.
