**Semantic Range:** Intransitive: to perish, to be lost, to be destroyed, to vanish, to wander away. Causative (Hiphil/Piel): to destroy, to cause to perish, to put to death, to exterminate. The primary concept is cessation of existence or being brought to ruin.

**LXX Translation Map:**
| Greek Word | Strong's | Count | PMI Score | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| apollymi | G622 | 141 | 30.45 | to destroy fully |
| apoleia | G684 | 11 | 10.82 | ruin, loss, destruction |
| phyge | G5437 | 3 | 7.36 | flight, escape |
| elpis | G1680 | 6 | 6.65 | hope |
| asebeis | G765 | 9 | 6.19 | ungodly |

| teko | G5080 | 3 | 5.03 | to melt |

**Key Finding:** The LXX overwhelmingly translates H6 (abad) as G622 (apollymi) -- 141 times with a PMI score of 30.45 (extremely high). This establishes abad-apollymi as the primary Hebrew-Greek destruction word pair. The noun form apoleia (G684) appears 11 times. This creates the abad -> apollymi -> apoleia lexical chain.

**Key Eschatological Verses:**
- Psa 1:6 -- "the way of the ungodly shall **perish** (abad)"
- Psa 2:12 -- "lest he be angry, and ye **perish** (abad) from the way"

- Matt 26:52 -- "all they that take the sword shall **perish** (apollymi) with the sword" -- physical death

### 3. H8045: shamad -- "to destroy, to exterminate"

**Lexical Data:**
- Hebrew: שָׁמַד
- Transliteration: shamad
- Pronunciation: shaw-mad
- Part of Speech: verb
- BLB Count: 90 occurrences
- KJV Occurrences: 101

**Definition (Strong's):**
A primitive root; to desolate: destroy(-uction), bring to nought, overthrow, perish, pluck down, utterly.

**Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| to destroy | 8 | 7.9% |
| thou be destroyed | 5 | 5.0% |
| destroyed | 5 | 5.0% |
| shall be destroyed | 5 | 5.0% |
| destroy | 4 | 4.0% |
| destroyed them | 3 | 3.0% |
| utterly | 2 | 2.0% |

**Semantic Range:** To destroy utterly, to exterminate, to annihilate, to bring to nought. Stronger than abad -- implies total, complete destruction. Used frequently for the destruction of nations, peoples, and cities. The intensified meaning is "to wipe out."

**LXX Translation Map:**
| Greek Word | Strong's | Count | PMI Score | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| apollymi | G622 | 23 | 14.39 | to destroy fully |
| exairo | G1808 | 12 | 11.04 | to remove completely |
| apoleia | G684 | 5 | 7.55 | ruin, destruction |
| planao | G4105 | 4 | 6.02 | to wander |
| hamartoloi | G268 | 4 | 5.79 | sinful |

**Key Finding:** The LXX translates shamad primarily as apollymi (G622) -- 23 times. Also uses exairo (to remove completely) 12 times and apoleia (destruction) 5 times. All top translations carry the meaning of complete removal or destruction, not ongoing torment.

**Key Eschatological Verses:**
- Psa 37:38 -- "the transgressors shall be **destroyed** (shamad) together"
- Psa 92:7 -- "they shall be **destroyed** (shamad) for ever"
- Psa 145:20 -- "all the wicked will he **destroy** (shamad)"

### 4. H3615: kalah -- "to consume, to finish, to complete"

**Lexical Data:**
- Hebrew: כָּלָה
- Transliteration: kalah
- Pronunciation: kaw-law
- Part of Speech: verb
- BLB Count: 206 occurrences
- KJV Occurrences: 254

**Definition (Strong's):**
A primitive root; to end, whether intransitive (to cease, be finished, perish) or transitive (to complete, prepare, consume): accomplish, cease, consume (away), determine, destroy (utterly), be (when...were) done, (be an) end (of), expire, (cause to) fail, faint, finish, fulfil, fully, have, leave (off), long, bring to pass, wholly reap, make clean riddance, spend, quite take away, waste.

**Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| had made an end | 13 | 5.1% |
| finished | 6 | 2.4% |
| shall fail | 6 | 2.4% |
| consumed | 4 | 1.6% |
| fail | 4 | 1.6% |
| faileth | 4 | 1.6% |
| shall consume | 2 | 0.8% |
| be consumed | 2 | 0.8% |

**Semantic Range:** Dual meaning: (1) To complete, finish, end (neutral: completing a task); (2) To consume, destroy, use up (destructive: consuming away). When applied to people, carries the meaning of being consumed, spent up, used up -- ceased to exist. The consumption metaphor is central: as fat is consumed in fire, as food is consumed by eating, so the wicked are consumed by God's judgment.

**LXX Translation Map:**
| Greek Word | Strong's | Count | PMI Score | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| synteleo | G4931 | 85 | 27.17 | to complete entirely, to consume |
| ekleipo | G1587 | 30 | 15.96 | to cease, to leave off, to fail |
| pauo | G3973 | 15 | 13.71 | to stop, to cease |
| orge | G3709 | 19 | 10.05 | wrath |
| teleo | G5055 | 5 | 9.84 | to end, to complete |
| analisko | G355 | 3 | 6.75 | to consume |
| syntelia | G4930 | 5 | 6.87 | consummation |

**Key Finding:** The LXX translates kalah primarily as synteleo (to complete entirely/consume, 85 times), ekleipo (to cease/fail, 30 times), and pauo (to stop, 15 times). The dominant semantic field is cessation, completion, and consumption. The presence of orge (wrath) in 19 instances connects consumption to divine judgment.

**Key Eschatological Verses:**
- Psa 37:20 -- "into smoke shall they **consume** (kalah) away"
- Psa 59:13 -- "**consume** (kalah) them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be"
- Psa 104:35 -- "let the sinners be **consumed** (kalah) out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more"
- Psa 73:19 -- "they are utterly **consumed** (kalah) with terrors"
- Isa 1:28 -- "they that forsake the LORD shall be **consumed** (kalah)"

### 5. H7843: shachath -- "to destroy, to corrupt, to ruin"

**Lexical Data:**
- Hebrew: שָׁחַת
- Transliteration: shachath
- Pronunciation: shaw-khath
- Part of Speech: verb
- BLB Count: 147 occurrences
- KJV Occurrences: 163

**Definition (Strong's):**
A primitive root; to decay, i.e. (causatively) ruin (literally or figuratively): batter, cast off, corrupt(-er, thing), destroy(-er, -uction), lose, mar, perish, spill, spoiler, utterly, waste(-r).

**Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| destroy | 14 | 8.6% |
| to destroy | 13 | 8.0% |
| to destroy it | 7 | 4.3% |
| destroyed | 5 | 3.1% |
| corrupt | 3 | 1.8% |
| have destroyed | 3 | 1.8% |
| destroying | 3 | 1.8% |
| have corrupted | 2 | 1.2% |
| corrupted | 2 | 1.2% |
| was marred | 2 | 1.2% |

**Semantic Range:** To decay, to corrupt, to ruin, to destroy, to spoil, to mar. The broadest of the four Hebrew destruction words. Includes both physical destruction and moral corruption. The root idea is spoiling, ruining, rendering useless -- something becoming unfit for its purpose.

**LXX Translation Map:**
| Greek Word | Strong's | Count | PMI Score | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| diaphtheiro | G1311 | 48 | 27.24 | to rot thoroughly, to ruin |
| phtheiro | G5351 | 6 | 12.44 | to corrupt, to destroy |
| kataklusmos | G2627 | 4 | 8.83 | inundation, flood |
| exaleipho | G1813 | 5 | 8.29 | to smear out, to obliterate |
| anomos | G459 | 7 | 7.58 | lawless |
| diaphthora | G1312 | 3 | 6.26 | decay, corruption |
| apollymi | G622 | 9 | 5.81 | to destroy fully |

**Key Finding:** The LXX translates shachath primarily as diaphtheiro (to rot thoroughly, to destroy, 48 times) and phtheiro (to corrupt/destroy, 6 times). The connection to diaphthora (G1312, decay/corruption) is important: this is the same word used in Acts 2:27,31 and Acts 13:34-37 for the corruption of the grave, linking shachath's "corruption" to physical decomposition.

**Key Eschatological Verses:**
- Gen 6:17 -- "to **destroy** (shachath) all flesh"
- Gen 18:28-32 -- "wilt thou **destroy** (shachath) all the city...?"
- Gen 19:13-14 -- "we will **destroy** (shachath) this place"
- Isa 11:9 -- "they shall not hurt nor **destroy** (shachath) in all my holy mountain"
- Isa 65:8 -- "**destroy** (shachath) it not; for a blessing is in it"
- Hos 13:9 -- "thou hast **destroyed** (shachath) thyself"

### 6. G684: apoleia -- "destruction, perdition"

**Lexical Data:**
- Greek: ἀπώλεια
- Transliteration: apoleia
- Pronunciation: ap-o-li-a
- Part of Speech: feminine noun
- BLB Count: 20 occurrences
- KJV Occurrences: 17

**Definition (Strong's):**
From a presumed derivative of apollymi; ruin or loss (physical, spiritual or eternal).

**Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| perdition | 5 | 29.4% |

| of perdition | 1 | 5.9% |
| damnable | 1 | 5.9% |
| pernicious ways | 1 | 5.9% |
| damnation | 1 | 5.9% |

**Semantic Range:** The noun form of apollymi (G622). Means destruction, ruin, loss, waste, perdition. Note: English "perdition" derives from Latin perdere (to lose/destroy) -- the same semantic field as the Greek. This is not a separate concept from "destruction"; it IS destruction.

**ALL Verses Using G684:**
1. Matt 7:13 -- "broad is the way, that leadeth to **destruction** (apoleia)"
2. Matt 26:8 -- "To what purpose is this **waste** (apoleia)?" (of ointment)
3. Mark 14:4 -- "Why was this **waste** (apoleia)?" (of ointment)

### 7. G3639: olethros -- "destruction, ruin"

**Lexical Data:**
- Greek: ὄλεθρος
- Transliteration: olethros
- Pronunciation: ol-eth-ros
- Part of Speech: masculine noun
- BLB Count: 4 occurrences

**Definition (Strong's):**
From a primary ollymi (to destroy; a prolonged form); ruin, i.e. death, punishment.

**Translation Distribution:**
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| destruction | 3 | 75.0% |
| the destruction | 1 | 25.0% |

**ALL 4 Verses (complete):**

1. **1 Cor 5:5** -- "To deliver such an one unto Satan for the **destruction** (olethros) of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
   - Context: Church discipline. The "destruction of the flesh" is remedial, not eschatological.

2. **1 Thess 5:3** -- "For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden **destruction** (olethros) cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."
   - Context: The Day of the Lord. Sudden destruction comes upon the unprepared.

3. **2 Thess 1:9** -- "Who shall be punished with everlasting **destruction** (olethros) from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"
   - Context: The return of Christ. The ONLY verse pairing aionios with olethros.

4. **1 Tim 6:9** -- "But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in **destruction** (olethros) and perdition (apoleia)."
   - Context: Warning against greed. Uses BOTH olethros AND apoleia.

**Key Finding:** Olethros means "destruction, ruin, death." It never means "ongoing conscious torment." In 2 Thess 1:9, "everlasting destruction (olethros aionios)" pairs "everlasting" with a word meaning "destruction/ruin." Olethros is etymologically related to ollymi, the root of apollymi (G622), placing it in the same destruction word family.

## CROSS-REFERENCE: TORMENT VOCABULARY (for comparison)

The following words form the "torment" semantic field, which is distinct from the "destruction" semantic field:

### G929: basanismos -- "torment, torture"
- 6 NT occurrences
- Rev 9:5; 14:11; 18:7,10,15 -- all in Revelation
- Matt 4:24 (variant reading)

- 12 NT occurrences
- Used of physical ailments (Matt 8:6), sea storms (Matt 14:24), and eschatological torment (Rev 14:10; 20:10)

- 2 NT occurrences
- Matt 25:46 -- "everlasting punishment" (kolasis)

**Key Distinction:** The destruction vocabulary (apollymi, apoleia, olethros, etc.) and the torment vocabulary (basanizo, basanismos, kolasis) are different word families with different semantic ranges. The Bible uses destruction vocabulary far more frequently than torment vocabulary when describing the fate of the wicked.

## SUMMARY: THE DESTRUCTION WORD FAMILY

### Hebrew Destruction Words:
| Word | Strong's | Count | Primary Meaning | LXX Primary Translation |
|------|---------|-------|----------------|------------------------|

### Greek Destruction Words:
| Word | Strong's | Count | Primary Meaning | Hebrew Source |
|------|---------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| apollymi | G622 | 92 | destroy, perish | abad (141x), shamad (23x) |
| apoleia | G684 | 20 | destruction, perdition | noun of apollymi |

### Combined Occurrences:

- Grand total: ~743 occurrences across both testaments

### The Abad-Apollymi-Apoleia Lexical Chain:
H6 (abad, verb, "perish") --> G622 (apollymi, verb, via LXX 141x) --> G684 (apoleia, noun form)

This chain establishes that when the NT uses apollymi or apoleia for the fate of the wicked, it draws on the same vocabulary that the OT uses for perishing and destruction throughout its entire narrative.
