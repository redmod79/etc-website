## Question
What do the primary biblical destruction terms mean? Are they semantically destruction/cessation-of-existence terms, or can they signify ongoing conscious torment?

## Part 1: Greek Destruction Terms

### G622 — ἀπόλλυμι (apollumi)

**Original:** ἀπόλλυμι
**Transliteration:** apóllymi
**Pronunciation:** ap-ol-loo-mee
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**BLB Count:** 92 NT occurrences

**Lexical Definition:**
From apo (from, away) + the base of ollumi (to destroy; a prolonged form). "To destroy fully (reflexively, to perish, or lose), literally or figuratively." Core meaning: complete loss or destruction; to bring to ruin; to be ruined/lost/destroyed.

**KJV Renderings (NT):**
- perish (10x)
- destroy/to destroy (12x combined)
- lose/lost/be lost (16x combined)
- perished (2x)
- perisheth (3x)
- others: mar, destroyed, die

**Range of Usage:**

*Non-eschatological (literal destruction):*
- Wineskins burst/ruined (Mat 9:17; Lk 5:37) — physical destruction
- Lost sheep (Mat 10:6; 15:24; Lk 15:4,6,8,9) — being lost/gone
- "Perish" in shipwreck (Mat 8:25; Act 27:34) — physical death
- Hair of head shall not perish (Lk 21:18) — death
- Heavens shall perish (Heb 1:11) — cosmic dissolution

*Eschatological (judgment/fate of wicked):*
- "destroy both soul and body in hell" (Mat 10:28) — God's destructive power
- "shall all likewise perish" (Lk 13:3,5) — consequence of unrepentance
- "should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn 3:16) — ultimate fate antithesis
- "they shall never perish" (Jn 10:28) — security of believers stated negatively
- "shall also perish without law" (Rom 2:12) — outcome for Gentiles who sin
- "them that are perishing" (1 Cor 1:18; 2 Cor 2:15; 4:3; 2 Th 2:10) — present participle: class currently moving toward destruction
- "dead in Christ are perished" (1 Cor 15:18) — what happens if resurrection is false
- "not willing that any should perish" (2 Pet 3:9) — God's will regarding human fate

**Semantic Analysis:**
Apollo means to DESTROY FULLY or PERISH COMPLETELY. The word is never used to mean "suffer consciously without dying." Its semantic range encompasses:
- Physical death (literal ruin of the body)
- Loss (something gone/missing)
- Complete destruction/annihilation

The word stands in direct contrast to:
- "have everlasting life" (Jn 3:16) — life vs. destruction
- "be saved" (1 Cor 1:18) — saved vs. perishing
- Resurrection hope (1 Cor 15:18) — resurrection vs. perished

**LXX Correspondence:**
Primary translation of H6 (abad) — 141 occurrences, PMI score 6.14. This is the strongest cross-testament semantic link. When the Psalms say the wicked shall abad (perish/be destroyed), the LXX renders it apollumi. The NT writers drawing on the Septuagint would hear apollumi in the same register as abad.

### G684 — ἀπώλεια (apoleia)

**Original:** ἀπώλεια
**Transliteration:** apṓleia
**Pronunciation:** ap-o-li-a
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 20 NT occurrences

**Lexical Definition:**
From a presumed derivative of apollumi. "Ruin or loss (physical, spiritual or eternal)." The noun form of apollumi's destructive semantic field.

**KJV Renderings:**
- perdition (5x)
- destruction (4x)
- waste (2x)
- perish (1x)
- damnable/damnation (2x — same word rendered differently)
- pernicious ways (1x)

**Key Occurrences:**

| Reference | Context | KJV Rendering |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Mat 7:13 | Broad way leads to destruction | "destruction" |
| Jn 17:12 | Judas = "son of perdition" | "perdition" |
| Rom 9:22 | Vessels of wrath fitted to destruction | "destruction" |
| Phil 1:28 | To adversaries a token of perdition | "perdition" |
| Phil 3:19 | Enemies of cross: end is destruction | "destruction" |
| 2 Th 2:3 | Man of sin = son of perdition | "perdition" |
| 1 Tim 6:9 | Foolish lusts drown in destruction and perdition | "destruction" + "perdition" |
| Heb 10:39 | Not of them who draw back to perdition | "perdition" |
| 2 Pet 2:1 | False teachers bring swift destruction | "destruction" |
| 2 Pet 2:3 | Their damnation slumbereth not | "damnation" |
| 2 Pet 3:7 | Day of judgment and perdition of ungodly | "perdition" |
| Rev 17:8 | Beast goes into perdition | "perdition" |
| Rev 17:11 | Beast goes into perdition | "perdition" |

**Semantic Analysis:**
Apoleia is consistently used for the ultimate fate of the wicked — their final "destination" or "end." It denotes:
- The result/outcome of being destroyed (apollumi)
- Ruin, loss, permanent destruction
- Never used to mean "ongoing conscious torment" — always the state of ruin/destruction

The word "perdition" (the traditional KJV rendering) captures the sense of being "lost" — permanently, utterly lost/ruined. The "son of perdition" = one whose destiny is destruction.

**LXX Correspondence:**
Translates H6 (abad) — 11 occurrences, PMI 4.35; H8045 (shamad) — 5 occurrences, PMI 4.21.

### G3639 — ὄλεθρος (olethros)

**Original:** ὄλεθρος
**Transliteration:** ólethros
**Pronunciation:** ol-eth-ros
**Part of Speech:** Masculine noun
**BLB Count:** 4 NT occurrences

**Lexical Definition:**
"From a primary ollumi (to destroy; a prolonged form); ruin, i.e. death, punishment." The word denotes ruin, destruction — what happens when something is totally wrecked.

**All 4 NT Occurrences:**

| Reference | Context | Full Phrase |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 Th 5:3 | Sudden destruction comes upon unbelievers | "sudden destruction" (aiphnidios olethros) |
| 2 Th 1:9 | Fate of those who know not God | "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion) |
| 1 Cor 5:5 | Discipline of immoral church member | "destruction of the flesh" (olethron tēs sarkos) |
| 1 Tim 6:9 | Fate of those who love money | "destruction and perdition" (olethron kai apōleian) |

**Semantic Analysis:**
- Every occurrence points to destruction/ruin, not ongoing torment
- "Everlasting destruction" (2 Th 1:9) — the aionios qualifier modifies the DESTRUCTION, not the suffering
- "Sudden destruction" (1 Th 5:3) — like labor pains: unexpected, unavoidable, terminal
- "Destruction of the flesh" (1 Cor 5:5) — temporal, with redemptive purpose; flesh dies so spirit may be saved
- Never paired with basanizō or basanismos — the destruction vocabulary and torment vocabulary are separate

**Eschatological weight:**
2 Th 1:9 is the most eschatologically significant occurrence. "Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord" is either:
(a) Destruction that is permanent/irreversible in its effects ("everlasting" modifies the permanence of the outcome), or
(b) A process of destruction that continues forever (which would be unusual for a destruction-word)

The nature of olethros as a noun of result (not process) favors (a): the destruction is complete and its result is permanent.

### G5356 — φθορά (phthora)

**Original:** φθορά
**Transliteration:** phthorá
**Pronunciation:** fthor-ah
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 9

**Lexical Definition:**
"From phtheirō (to decay); decay, i.e. ruin (spontaneous or inflicted, literally or figuratively)." Covers both natural decay/corruption and judgment-destruction.

**Key Occurrences:**

| Reference | Context | KJV Rendering |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Rom 8:21 | Creation subject to corruption | "corruption" |
| 1 Cor 15:42,50 | Physical body = corruptible | "corruption" |
| Gal 6:8 | Sow to flesh = reap corruption | "corruption" |
| Col 2:22 | Things that perish with using | "perish" |
| 2 Pet 1:4 | Escaped the corruption in the world | "corruption" |
| 2 Pet 2:12 | Made to be taken and destroyed; perish in own corruption | "corruption" (2x) |
| 2 Pet 2:19 | Servants of corruption | "corruption" |

**Semantic Analysis:**
Phthora covers the spectrum from natural biological decay (1 Cor 15 — the corruptible body) to moral corruption (2 Pet 2:19) to divine judgment (Gal 6:8). The common thread is dissolution/decay — things falling apart, decaying, ceasing to maintain their integrity.

Key usage in Gal 6:8: "sow to the flesh → reap phthora (corruption/decay)" contrasted with "sow to Spirit → reap zoe aionios (eternal life)." The opposite of eternal life is not eternal torment but corruption/decay.

The 2 Pet 2:12 usage is especially significant: false teachers are compared to animals made for "phthora" (destruction/being taken) and will "perish [phtharēsontai] in their own phthora [corruption]."

### G4881 — συναπόλλυμι (synapollumi)

**Original:** συναπόλλυμι
**Transliteration:** synapóllymi
**Part of Speech:** Verb (compound)
**BLB Count:** 1 NT occurrence

**Lexical Definition:**
"From syn (together) and apollumi; to destroy (middle voice or passively, be slain) in company with."

**Occurrence:** Hebrews 11:31 — Rahab "perished not with them that believed not"

**Note:** The compound syn+apollumi = to perish together with. Rahab was not destroyed/perished together with the unbelievers in Jericho. The word emphasizes collective/shared destruction.

---

### G853 — ἀφανίζω (aphanizō)

**Original:** ἀφανίζω
**Transliteration:** aphanízō
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**BLB Count:** 5

**Lexical Definition:**
"From aphanes (not appearing); to render unapparent, i.e. (actively) consume (becloud), or (passively) disappear."

**Occurrences:** Mat 6:16,19; Acts 13:41; Jas 4:14

**Semantic note:** Root meaning = to make invisible/disappear. The word carries the sense of vanishing — becoming as if one never existed. Used in Mat 6:19 for moth and rust "corrupting" (consuming, making disappear).

---

## Part 2: Hebrew Destruction Terms

### H6 — אָבַד (abad)

**Original:** אָבַד
**Transliteration:** abad
**Pronunciation:** aw-bad
**Part of Speech:** Verb (Qal, Piel, Hiphil)
**BLB Count:** 184

**Lexical Definition:**
"A primitive root; properly, to wander away, i.e. lose oneself; by implication to perish (causative, destroy)."

KJV renderings: perish (16x), destroy (many), cause to perish, lost, lose, be undone, fail, not escape, spend

**Verbal Stems:**
- Qal: to perish, to be lost (intransitive)
- Piel: to cause to perish, to destroy (rare)
- Hiphil: to destroy, to cause to perish (causative)

**Key Eschatological Occurrences:**

| Reference | Context | Stem | Form |
|-----------|---------|------|------|
| Psa 1:6 | Way of ungodly shall perish | Qal | Impf 3fs |
| Psa 37:20 | The wicked shall perish | Qal | Impf 3mp |
| Psa 68:2 | Wicked perish at God's presence | Qal | Impf 3mp |
| Psa 73:27 | They far from God shall perish | Qal | Impf 3mp |
| Psa 92:9 | Enemies of LORD shall perish | Qal | Impf 3mp |
| Psa 9:5 | Thou hast destroyed the wicked | ? | Perf |
| Psa 9:6 | Their memorial perished | Qal | Perf |
| Pro 10:28 | Expectation of wicked shall perish | Qal | Impf |
| Pro 11:10 | When wicked perish | Qal | Inf Cst |
| Isa 26:14 | Thou hast destroyed them | Hiphil | Perf |
| Isa 41:11 | They that strive with thee shall perish | Qal | Impf |

**Semantic Analysis:**
Abad covers the semantic field of being/becoming lost — from the concrete (a lost animal, 1 Sam 9:3) to the eschatological (the wicked shall perish, Ps 37:20). The root idea is "wandering away" that leads to being lost/gone. In eschatological contexts, abad consistently describes the final, complete ending of the wicked — they are lost/gone/perished.

The LXX's dominant rendering (apollumi, 141x) confirms the semantic equivalence: abad = apollumi. NT writers who quote or echo the Psalms are drawing on the same destruction vocabulary.

### H8045 — שָׁמַד (shamad)

**Original:** שָׁמַד
**Transliteration:** shāmad
**Pronunciation:** shaw-mad
**Part of Speech:** Verb (Niphal, Hiphil)
**BLB Count:** 90

**Lexical Definition:**
"A primitive root; to desolate:—destroy(-uction), bring to nought, overthrow, perish, pluck down, utterly."

**Key Stems:**
- Niphal: to be destroyed, to be overthrown (passive)
- Hiphil: to destroy, to bring to nought (causative)

**Key Eschatological Occurrences:**

| Reference | Context | Form |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Psa 37:38 | Transgressors shall be destroyed together | Niphal Perf 3p |
| Psa 83:11 | Make their nobles like Oreb/Zeeb | Niphal |
| Psa 92:7 | They shall be destroyed for ever | Niphal Impf |
| Psa 145:20 | All the wicked will he destroy | Hiphil Impf |
| Isa 13:9 | He shall destroy sinners out of it | Hiphil |
| Isa 26:14 | They shall not rise... thou hast destroyed them | Hiphil |
| Amos 9:8 | I will destroy the sinful kingdom | Hiphil |

**Semantic Analysis:**
Shamad is a strong, total destruction word — "to desolate, bring to nought." It's used for the complete elimination of armies, nations, and peoples. In eschatological Psalms, it appears in Niphal (passive: they are destroyed) alongside abad and karat. The combined effect in Psalm 37:38 is emphatic: "shall be destroyed [shamad] together; the end of the wicked shall be cut off [karat]."

Psalm 92:7 uses "shamad l'olam" (destroyed forever) — permanence of the destruction.

**LXX Correspondence:**
Primarily apollumi (23x, PMI 4.53) — confirming the destruction semantic field.

### H3615 — כָּלָה (kalah) [Verb]

**Original:** כָּלָה
**Transliteration:** kālāh
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**BLB Count:** 206

**Lexical Definition:**
"A primitive root; to end, whether intransitive (to cease, be finished, perish) or transitive (to complete, prepare, consume)."

**Semantic Range:**
Kalah covers the full spectrum from neutral completion (finishing building the temple) to destruction (consuming the enemy). The key in eschatological contexts is the "consume" meaning — fire consuming, enemies consumed.

**Key Eschatological Occurrences:**

| Reference | Context | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Psa 37:20 | "they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away" | consumed/perish |
| Nah 1:8 | "he will make an utter end" | total end |
| Nah 1:9 | "he will make an utter end" | total end |
| Isa 66:17 | "they shall be consumed together" | consumed |
| Ezek 5:12-13 | "mine anger shall be accomplished" | fulfilled/consumed |

**Connection to H3617 (noun):**
The noun form kalah (H3617) = "a completion; adverb, completely; also destruction." Nahum 1:8-9 uses the noun kalah for "utter end" — the end is complete, nothing remains.

---

### H3617 — כָּלָה (kalah) [Noun]

**Definition:** "A completion; adverb, completely; also destruction:—altogether, (be, utterly) consume(-d), consummation(-ption), was determined, (full, utter) end, riddance."

**Critical Occurrence:**
Nahum 1:8-9: "He will make an **utter end** [kalah] of the place thereof... he will make an **utter end** [kalah]: **affliction shall not rise up the second time**."

The "affliction shall not rise up the second time" (Nah 1:9) is extremely significant: the destruction is so complete that the enemy cannot threaten again. This implies their complete elimination, not ongoing existence in a tormented state.

---

### H7843 — שָׁחַת (shachath)

**Original:** שָׁחַת
**Transliteration:** shāchath
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**BLB Count:** 147

**Lexical Definition:**
"A primitive root; to decay, i.e. (causatively) ruin (literally or figuratively):—batter, cast off, corrupt(-er, thing), destroy(-er, -uction), lose, mar, perish, spill, spoiler, utterly, waste(-r)."

**Semantic Range:**
Shachath carries both the sense of moral corruption (Gen 6:12 — "all flesh had corrupted his way") and physical destruction (Gen 6:17 — "I will destroy them"). The word links corruption and destruction — the moral decay that leads to physical ruin.

**Key Occurrences:**
- Gen 6:11-12: Earth "corrupt" (shachath); God will "destroy" (shachath) both
- Ezek 28:17: Prince of Tyre "corrupted his wisdom" (shachath) — same verb for moral and judicial destruction

---

### H3772 — כָּרַת (karat)

**Original:** כָּרַת
**Transliteration:** kārath
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**BLB Count:** 288

**Lexical Definition:**
"A primitive root; to cut (off, down or asunder); by implication, to destroy or consume; specifically, to covenant."

**Eschatological Uses in Psalm 37 (Five Occurrences):**

| Verse | Hebrew | Parsing | Translation |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 37:9 | יִכָּרֵתוּן | Niphal Impf 3mp | "evildoers shall be cut off" |
| 37:22 | יִכָּרֵתוּ | Niphal Impf 3mp | "cursed of him shall be cut off" |
| 37:28 | נִכְרָת | Niphal Perf 3ms | "seed of wicked shall be cut off" |
| 37:34 | הִכָּרֵת | Niphal Inf Abs | "when wicked are cut off" |
| 37:38 | נִכְרָתָה | Niphal Perf 3fs | "end of wicked shall be cut off" |

**Semantic Analysis:**
Karat (to cut) is used both for covenant-making (cutting an animal = sealing a covenant) and for judgment (cutting off = eliminating). In Psalm 37, it's consistently in the Niphal (passive) — the wicked are cut off by God. "Being cut off" implies complete severance from the community of life — death, not ongoing existence.

**LXX Correspondence:**
- G1303 (diatithēmi — covenant) 71x (the covenant uses)
- G1581 (ekkoptō — to cut out) 13x (the cut-off uses)
- G622 (apollumi) 21x — some cut-off uses also rendered as apollumi

---

### H8552 — תָּמַם (tamam)

**Original:** תָּמַם
**Transliteration:** tāmam
**Part of Speech:** Verb
**BLB Count:** 64

**Lexical Definition:**
"A primitive root; to complete, in a good or a bad sense, literal, or figurative, transitive or intransitive: accomplish, cease, be clean (pass-)ed, consume, have done, (come to an, have an, make an) end, fail, come to the full, be all gone, be all here, be (make) perfect, be spent, sum, be (shew self) upright, be wasted, whole."

**Key Eschatological Occurrence:**
Psalm 104:35: "Let the sinners **be consumed** [yittamu] out of the earth, and let the wicked **be no more** [ain]."
- Tamam = be finished, consumed, come to an end
- Followed immediately by ain (non-existence)
- The consumption leads to their non-existence

---

## Part 3: Contrast Terms — Life vs. Destruction

### G2222 — ζωή (zoe) — Life

**Transliteration:** zōḗ
**Part of Speech:** Feminine noun
**BLB Count:** 134

**Definition:** "From zaō (to live); life (literally or figuratively)."

**Structural Antithesis:**
Zoe stands as the direct opposite of apollumi/apoleia throughout the NT. The eschatological choice is always presented as binary:

| Destruction term | Life term | Reference |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| apollumi (perish) | zoe aionios (everlasting life) | Jn 3:16 |
| apoleia (destruction) | zoe | Mat 7:13-14 |
| thanatos (death) | zoe aionios (eternal life) | Rom 6:23 |
| katakrima (condemnation) | zoe (life) | Jn 5:24 |
| kolasis aionios (punishment) | zoe aionios (life) | Mat 25:46 |

**Key:** If the opposite of "eternal life" is "ongoing conscious torment," then the antithesis would be between two forms of ongoing conscious existence. But if the opposite of "eternal life" is "destruction/perishing," then the antithesis is between existence and non-existence. The structural evidence of zoe vs. apollumi/apoleia favors the latter.

---

### G5590 — ψυχή (psuche) — Soul

**Definition:** "Breath, i.e. (by implication) spirit, abstractly or concretely (the animal sentient principle only)."

**Critical Eschatological Text:**
Matthew 10:28 — "Fear him which is able to **destroy** [apolesai — G622] both **soul** [psuche — G5590] and body in hell."

**Implication:** The psuche (soul) is NOT inherently indestructible. God can apollumi (destroy) the psuche just as he can destroy the body. This is the direct refutation of the Greek philosophical idea of the naturally immortal soul. The soul's survival beyond death is not guaranteed by its nature — it depends on God's action.

---

### H5315 — נֶפֶשׁ (nephesh) — Soul

**Definition:** "Properly, a breathing creature... soul, body, breath, creature, dead(-ly), desire, heart(-y), life..."

**Key Statement:**
Ezekiel 18:4,20: "The soul [nephesh] that sinneth, it shall die [muth — H4191]."

Nephesh can die. This is the Hebrew counterpart of psuche. The nephesh is the animating life-force of a person, but it is mortal — it can be destroyed. The wicked nephesh is put to death by God's judgment; it does not continue in endless torment as an inherently immortal entity.

---

## Part 4: LXX Mapping Summary

### H6 (abad) → G622 (apollumi): The Dominant Bridge

| Pair | Count | PMI | Score | Significance |
|------|-------|-----|-------|--------------|
| H6 → G622 | 141 | 6.14 | 30.45 | Dominant; strongest cross-testament link |
| H6 → G684 | 11 | 4.35 | 10.82 | Secondary |

**Conclusion:** When the OT says the wicked shall abad (perish/be destroyed), and the LXX translates this as apollumi, and then the NT uses apollumi for the fate of the wicked — all three point to the same conceptual field: destruction/perishing, not ongoing conscious torment.

### H8045 (shamad) → G622 (apollumi)

| Pair | Count | PMI | Score |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| H8045 → G622 | 23 | 4.53 | 14.39 |
| H8045 → G684 | 5 | 4.21 | 7.55 |

The LXX also predominantly renders shamad (annihilate/desolate) as apollumi, further confirming the semantic equivalence.

### H3615 (kalah) → G4931 (synteleō)

| Pair | Count | PMI | Score |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| H3615 → G4931 (complete/consume) | 85 | 6.10 | 27.17 |
| H3615 → G1587 (ekleipō — fail/cease) | 30 | 4.65 | 15.96 |

The LXX renders kalah primarily as "bring to completion/consume" — consistent with the destruction/finishing semantic.

### H3772 (karat) → Greek equivalents

| Pair | Count | PMI |
|------|-------|-----|
| H3772 → G1303 (diatithēmi — covenant) | 71 | 6.22 |
| H3772 → G1581 (ekkoptō — cut out) | 13 | 5.07 |
| H3772 → G622 (apollumi) | 21 | 2.72 |

The covenant uses dominate, but the cut-off uses (ekkoptō, apollumi) confirm the destructive semantic when karat is used in judgment contexts.

## Part 5: Destruction vs. Torment Vocabulary — Lexical Distribution

### Key Observation
The destruction vocabulary (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora, abad, shamad, kalah, karat) and the torment vocabulary (basanizō, basanismos, kolasis) are largely SEPARATE vocabularies that appear in DIFFERENT passages and describe DIFFERENT subjects:

**Destruction vocabulary passages:**
- Psa 1, 9, 37, 68, 73, 92, 104 — Hebrew abad, shamad, karat, kalah
- Mal 4:1-3 — fire, ashes
- Obad 1:16 — "as though they had not been"
- Nah 1:8-9 — "utter end"
- Jn 3:16; Mat 10:28; Lk 13:3,5 — apollumi
- Rom 2:12; 6:23; 9:22 — apollumi/apoleia/thanatos
- Phil 3:19; 2 Th 1:9; 1 Th 5:3 — apoleia/olethros
- 2 Pet 2:1,3,12; 3:9 — apoleia/phthora/apollumi

**Torment vocabulary passages:**
- Rev 14:10-11 — basanizō/basanismos (beast-worshippers)
- Rev 20:10 — basanizō (devil, beast, false prophet)
- Mat 25:46 — kolasis aionion (the wicked at judgment)
- Rev 9:5 — basanizō (locusts, temporary torment)

**Critical distinction:** The torment vocabulary in eschatological contexts is largely confined to Revelation and applies specifically to:
- The devil, beast, and false prophet (Rev 20:10)
- Those who worship the beast and receive his mark (Rev 14:10-11)

The destruction vocabulary applies broadly to all the wicked throughout Scripture.

**The central analytical question for the Analysis Agent:**
Do the torment passages (confined to Revelation, with specific subjects) describe the same outcome as the destruction passages (ubiquitous, with general subjects), or do they describe different outcomes for different subjects/classes? The two vocabularies are lexically distinct: destruction words (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora) never mean "torment"; torment words (basanizō, basanismos) never mean "destruction/perishing."
