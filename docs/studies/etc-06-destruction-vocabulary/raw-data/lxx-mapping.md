## Hebrew Destruction Terms → Greek LXX Equivalents

### H6 — אָבַד (abad) → Primary: G622 (apollumi)

| Greek Term | G# | Count | PMI  | Score | Definition                         |
|------------|-----|-------|------|-------|------------------------------------|
| ἀπόλλυμι   | G622 | 141  | 6.14 | 30.45 | to destroy fully; to perish        |
| ἀπώλεια    | G684 | 11   | 4.35 | 10.82 | ruin, loss, destruction            |
| φυγή       | G5437| 3    | 5.31 | 7.36  | fleeing, escape (rare)             |
| ἐλπίς      | G1680| 6    | 3.42 | 6.65  | hope (contextual, rare)            |
| ἀσεβής     | G765 | 9    | 2.69 | 6.19  | ungodly/wicked (contextual)        |
| ἐπιλανθάνομαι | G1950 | 6 | 3.01 | 5.86 | to forget (contextual)            |
| πλανάω     | G4105| 4    | 2.74 | 4.41  | to wander/go astray                |

**Analysis:** G622 (apollumi) is overwhelmingly the dominant LXX equivalent for H6 (abad), with 141 occurrences and a PMI of 6.14 — far above all alternatives. G684 (apoleia) is the secondary match (11x). This confirms that when NT writers use apollumi/apoleia for the fate of the wicked, they are drawing on the same semantic range as H6 in the OT. The Hebrew concept of abad (perishing, being destroyed, ceasing to exist) maps directly onto the Greek apollumi family.

### H8045 — שָׁמַד (shamad) → Primary: G622 (apollumi)

| Greek Term | G# | Count | PMI  | Score | Definition                         |
|------------|-----|-------|------|-------|------------------------------------|
| ἀπόλλυμι   | G622 | 23   | 4.53 | 14.39 | to destroy fully; to perish        |
| ἐξαίρω     | G1808| 12   | 4.31 | 11.04 | to remove, put away                |
| ἀπώλεια    | G684 | 5    | 4.21 | 7.55  | ruin, destruction                  |
| πρόσωπον   | G4383| 20   | 2.44 | 7.43  | face (contextual)                  |
| πλανάω     | G4105| 4    | 3.74 | 6.02  | to wander/go astray                |
| ἔθνος      | G1484| 12   | 2.34 | 6.01  | nation (contextual)                |
| ἁμαρτωλός  | G268 | 4    | 3.60 | 5.79  | sinful, sinner (contextual)        |

**Analysis:** Shamad (to desolate, utterly destroy) also maps primarily to G622 (apollumi, 23x, PMI 4.53) and G684 (apoleia, 5x). G1808 (exairō = to remove) is secondary — reflecting shamad's emphasis on complete removal/elimination. The PMI of 4.53 for G622-shamad confirms tight semantic correspondence, though slightly lower than abad-apollumi (6.14) because shamad is used more exclusively for violent/military annihilation.

### H3615 — כָּלָה (kalah) → Primary: G4931 (synteleō)

| Greek Term | G# | Count | PMI  | Score | Definition                            |
|------------|-----|-------|------|-------|---------------------------------------|
| συντελέω   | G4931 | 85  | 6.10 | 27.17 | to complete entirely, finish off      |
| ἐκλείπω    | G1587 | 30  | 4.65 | 15.96 | to fail, cease, be wanting            |
| παύω       | G3973 | 15  | 4.94 | 13.71 | to stop, pause, cause to cease        |
| ὀργή       | G3709 | 19  | 3.36 | 10.05 | wrath, anger (contextual)             |
| τελέω      | G5055 | 5   | 5.49 | 9.84  | to end, complete, execute             |
| καταπαύω   | G2664 | 7   | 3.90 | 8.10  | to settle down, stop, bring to rest   |
| συντέλεια  | G4930 | 5   | 3.83 | 6.87  | entire completion, consummation       |
| ἀναλίσκω   | G355  | 3   | 4.87 | 6.75  | to consume utterly                    |

**Analysis:** Kalah (to finish, complete, come to an end) maps primarily to G4931 (synteleō = "to complete entirely"). This is different from apollumi — kalah conveys the idea of an action running to completion, coming to its end, being exhausted or consumed. In eschatological texts like Ps 37:20 ("they shall consume as the fat of lambs"), it describes the wicked being used up/exhausted. The NT term synteleō is used in Matthew 13:39-40, 49 (the "end of the age") — the consummation of the age. G1587 (ekleipō = fail, cease) is secondary, emphasizing the cessation aspect.

### H3772 — כָּרַת (karat) → Primary: G1303 (diatithēmi) / G1581 (ekkoptō)

| Greek Term | G# | Count | PMI  | Score | Definition                              |
|------------|-----|-------|------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| διατίθεμαι | G1303 | 71  | 6.22 | 26.59 | to put apart; to covenant (make a covenant) |
| διαθήκη    | G1242 | 83  | 4.63 | 20.50 | covenant, testament                     |
| ἐκκόπτω    | G1581 | 13  | 5.07 | 13.38 | to cut out/off; to hew down             |
| κόπτω      | G2875 | 15  | 4.05 | 11.23 | to chop, cut down                       |
| ἐξαίρω     | G1808 | 22  | 3.51 | 11.00 | to remove, put away                     |
| ἐκλείπω    | G1587 | 16  | 3.24 | 9.18  | to fail, cease, be wanting              |
| ἀπόλλυμι   | G622  | 21  | 2.72 | 8.42  | to destroy fully; to perish             |
| ψυχή       | G5590 | 34  | 2.09 | 7.44  | soul, life, person                      |

**Analysis:** Karat (to cut off) shows a split semantic range in the LXX. The highest-frequency translation is G1303 (diatithēmai = "to make a covenant") — because karat berit = "to cut a covenant" is the OT idiom for covenant-making. So the majority of karat occurrences in the LXX are covenant contexts. For the eschatological "cut off the wicked" meaning, the relevant LXX equivalents are: G1581 (ekkoptō = cut off/hew down, 13x PMI 5.07), G1587 (ekleipō = fail/cease, 16x), and G622 (apollumi, 21x PMI 2.72). Matthew 3:10/Luke 3:9 use G1581 ekkoptō for "cut down" — a direct parallel to karat's cutting imagery. Paul uses ekleipō (fail/cease) in 1 Cor 13:8.

### H7843 — שָׁחַת (shachath) → Primary: G1311 (diaphtheirō)

| Greek Term | G# | Count | PMI  | Score | Definition                              |
|------------|-----|-------|------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| διαφθείρω  | G1311 | 48  | 7.00 | 27.24 | to rot thoroughly; to corrupt, destroy  |
| φθείρω     | G5351 | 6   | 6.39 | 12.44 | to corrupt, destroy                     |
| κατακλυσμός| G2627 | 4   | 5.49 | 8.83  | an inundation, flood                    |
| ἐξαλείφω  | G1813 | 5   | 4.63 | 8.29  | to smear out, obliterate, erase         |
| ἄνομος     | G459  | 7   | 3.64 | 7.58  | lawless (contextual)                    |
| διαφθορά   | G1312 | 3   | 4.52 | 6.26  | decay, corruption                       |
| ἀπόλλυμι   | G622  | 9   | 2.52 | 5.81  | to destroy fully                        |

**Analysis:** Shachath (to decay, ruin, corrupt) maps primarily to G1311 (diaphtheirō = "to rot thoroughly, corrupt thoroughly"). This is the word family of G5356 (phthora = corruption) used by Paul in Gal 6:8 and 2 Pet 2:12. The high PMI of 7.00 for diaphtheirō confirms very tight correspondence. Note G2627 (kataklysmós = flood) appears because shachath is the verb used when God "destroyed" the earth with the flood (Gen 6:17: "I will destroy [shachath] all flesh"). This reinforces the connection between shachath and absolute annihilating destruction — the flood destroyed completely.

### H8552 — תָּמַם (tamam) → Primary: G1587 (ekleipō)

| Greek Term | G# | Count | PMI  | Score | Definition                              |
|------------|-----|-------|------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| ἐκλείπω    | G1587 | 22  | 5.97 | 18.71 | to fail, cease, come to an end          |
| συντελέω   | G4931 | 9   | 4.63 | 10.65 | to complete entirely, finish off        |
| λιμός      | G3042 | 6   | 4.75 | 9.23  | famine, hunger                          |
| τέλος      | G5056 | 7   | 4.42 | 9.19  | end, conclusion, consummation           |
| τήκω       | G5080 | 3   | 5.22 | 7.24  | to liquefy, melt                        |

**Analysis:** Tamam (to be complete, be finished, be consumed) maps to G1587 (ekleipō = fail, cease, give out — as in Ps 104:35 "let sinners be consumed out of the earth"). The "ceasing/failing" semantic corresponds to tamam's sense of coming to an end or being exhausted. G5056 (telos = end) also appears — reflecting tamam's "reaching completion" sense. In Ps 104:35 (yittamu haChata'im = "let sinners be finished/consumed from the earth"), the LXX uses ekleipō to express this "ceasing to exist."

## Key Observation: The Apollumi/Apoleia Bridge

The NT's dominant destruction vocabulary (G622 apollumi, G684 apoleia, G3639 olethros, G5356 phthora) is linguistically grounded in OT Hebrew destruction vocabulary through the LXX:

1. **G622 apollumi** ← primarily translates **H6 abad** (141x, PMI 6.14) and **H8045 shamad** (23x, PMI 4.53)
2. **G684 apoleia** ← also translates **H6 abad** (11x) and **H8045 shamad** (5x)
3. **G5356 phthora** (corruption) ← connects to **H7843 shachath** via G1311 diaphtheirō family
4. **G4931 synteleō** ← translates **H3615 kalah** (85x, PMI 6.10) = completion/consumption

When Paul writes that "the wages of sin is death" (Rom 6:23), and John writes that believers "shall not perish" (apollētai, Jn 3:16), they are using vocabulary that the LXX established as the standard equivalent for the Hebrew words that describe the wicked "perishing" and "being destroyed" in OT eschatological texts.

The Hebrew-Greek semantic bridge confirms that OT destruction vocabulary (abad, shamad, kalah, karat) and NT destruction vocabulary (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora) form a unified semantic field across both testaments — consistently describing annihilation/cessation rather than ongoing torment.

## Contrast: What LXX Maps to Torment Vocabulary?

The NT torment terms (G928 basanizō = to torment; G929 basanismos = torment) do NOT appear as primary LXX equivalents for any of the Hebrew destruction terms above. These torment words have a different lexical history:
- G928 basanizō ← from basanos (touchstone for testing gold) → came to mean torture/testing
- Primary OT background: Daniel 7 (beasts) and intertestamental literature (Maccabees, Enoch)
- LXX uses of basanizō: primarily for physical torture of living persons (2 Macc 7; 4 Macc)

This lexical separation is significant: the LXX never uses basanizō/basanismos to translate the Hebrew words that describe the eschatological fate of the wicked (abad, shamad, kalah, karat). The two vocabulary sets — destruction and torment — represent distinct semantic domains in both Hebrew OT and Greek NT.
