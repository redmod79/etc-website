The concept of "soul" (psuche) in Matt 10:28 connects to the broader question of whether the soul can be destroyed.

## 2 Thessalonians 1:9

### Verse Text
"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"

### Concepts Found: GLORY (Kabod/doxa - weight, honor, splendor)
Strong's in verse: G1391 (glory, doxa)

### Same Chapter (2 Thessalonians 1)
1. 2 Thessalonians 1:10 [GLORY] -- "When he shall come to be glorified in his saints"

2. 2 Thessalonians 3:1 [GLORY] -- "that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified"

### Same Author (Paul) -- Key Connections
- 1 Cor 15:40-43 [GLORY] -- celestial/terrestrial glory; "sown in dishonour... raised in glory"
- 2 Cor 3:18 [GLORY] -- "changed into the same image from glory to glory"
- Phil 3:21 [GLORY] -- "shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body"
- Rom 8:18 [GLORY] -- "the glory which shall be revealed in us"

**Key observation:** The concept_context identifies GLORY (doxa) as the primary concept in 2 Thess 1:9. The "everlasting destruction from the glory of his power" connects to Paul's larger glory theology. The destruction is "from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power" -- the glory that transforms believers (Phil 3:21; 2 Cor 3:18) is the same glory that destroys the wicked.

## John 3:16

### Result
"No theological concepts found in JHN 3:16"

**Note:** The concept_context tool did not identify tagged theological concepts in this verse. However, John 3:16 contains the core "perish (apollymi) vs. everlasting life" contrast. Cross-testament parallels (see parallels.md) connect it to John 6:40 (0.518), John 3:15 (0.517), John 3:36 (0.478), and John 12:25 (0.474) -- all life/death contrasts.

The perish/life binary in John 3:16 functions as the paradigmatic destruction vocabulary passage: the alternative to everlasting life is not everlasting torment but perishing (apollymi).
