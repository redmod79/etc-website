## Contrast Terms (Life vs. Destruction)

### G2222 — ζωή (zoe)

```
Transliteration: zōḗ
Pronunciation:   dzo-ay
Part of Speech:  feminine noun (n-f)
BLB Count:       134

Definition:
  from zao (to live); life (literally or figuratively):—life(-time).
```

KJV renderings: life (134x in NT)

Key eschatological contrasts with destruction terms:
- John 3:16: "should not perish (apollumi) but have everlasting life (zoe aionios)"
- John 10:28: "they shall never perish (apollumi)" — context: gives eternal life (zoe)
- Romans 6:23: "wages of sin is death (thanatos); gift of God is eternal life (zoe aionios)"
- Matthew 7:14: "narrow way that leadeth unto life (zoe)"
- Matthew 25:46: "everlasting life (zoe aionios)" vs. "everlasting punishment (kolasis aionios)"
- 1 John 5:11-12: life (zoe) is in the Son; he that has not the Son has not life

Note: Zoe stands in direct antithesis to apollumi/apoleia — the choice is between life and destruction, not between two forms of ongoing existence.

---

### G5590 — ψυχή (psuche)

```
Transliteration: psychḗ
Pronunciation:   psoo-khay
Part of Speech:  feminine noun (n-f)
BLB Count:       105

Definition:
  from psucho (to breathe); breath, i.e. (by implication) spirit, abstractly
  or concretely (the animal sentient principle only; thus distinguished on
  the one hand from pneuma, which is the rational and immortal soul; and on
  the other from zoe, which is mere vitality, even of plants: these terms
  thus exactly correspond respectively to the Hebrew nephesh, ruach and
  chayyim):—heart(+ -ily), life, mind, soul, + us, + you.
```

KJV renderings: soul (58x), life (40x), mind (3x), heart (1x)

Critical eschatological occurrence: Matthew 10:28 — God is able to "destroy [apolesai — G622] both soul [psuchen] and body in gehenna."
- Both psuche and soma can be destroyed — neither is inherently indestructible.

---

### H5315 — נֶפֶשׁ (nephesh)

```
Transliteration: nephesh
Pronunciation:   neh-fesh
Part of Speech:  feminine noun (n-f)
BLB Count:       753

Definition:
  from naphash; properly, a breathing creature, i.e. animal of (abstractly)
  vitality; used very widely in a literal, accommodated or figurative sense
  (bodily or mental):—any, appetite, beast, body, breath, creature, dead(-ly),
  desire, (dis-)contented, fish, ghost, greedy, he, heart(-y), (hath,
  jeopardy of) life (in jeopardy), lust, man, me, mind, mortally, one, own,
  person, pleasure, (her-, him-, my-, thy-)self, them (your)-selves, slay,
  soul, tablet, they, thing, (she) will, would have it.
```

KJV renderings: soul (475x), life (117x), person (29x), mind (15x), heart (15x), creature (9x), body (8x), himself (8x), yourselves (6x), dead (5x), will (4x), desire (4x), man (3x), themselves (3x), any (3x), appetite (2x)

Note: Nephesh is the Hebrew counterpart of psuche. Nephesh that sins shall die (Ezek 18:4,20). The nephesh can perish (abad): see Ezek 22:27; 25:7; Jer 6:8; Job 31:39.

## LXX Mapping Summary

| Hebrew Term | LXX Greek (Primary) | Count | PMI | Secondary LXX |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|-----|---------------|
| H6 abad | G622 apollumi | 141 | 6.14 | G684 apoleia (11x) |
| H8045 shamad | G622 apollumi | 23 | 4.53 | G684 apoleia (5x) |
| H3615 kalah | G4931 synteleō | 85 | 6.10 | G1587 ekleipō (30x) |
| H3772 karat | G1303 diatithēmi | 71 | 6.22 | G1581 ekkoptō (13x); G622 apollumi (21x) |

Critical finding: The LXX bridge shows that H6 (abad) → G622 (apollumi) is the single dominant cross-testament correspondence for "perish/destroy." When Paul, Peter, or John use apollumi in eschatological contexts, they are drawing on the same conceptual field as the Psalms when they say the wicked shall abad (perish).
