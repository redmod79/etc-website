# Destruction Vocabulary: What the Bible Says About the Fate of the Wicked

## What This Study Covers

The Bible uses specific words to describe what happens to the wicked at judgment. This study examines those words -- both Hebrew words in the Old Testament and Greek words in the New Testament -- and asks a straightforward question: Do these words mean destruction and cessation, or do they mean something else, such as ongoing suffering in a ruined state? The answer matters because it bears directly on the debate between annihilationism (the view that the wicked ultimately perish and cease to exist) and the eternal torment view (the view that the wicked consciously suffer forever).

## The Core Vocabulary: What These Words Actually Mean

The Bible's vocabulary for the fate of the wicked is dominated by destruction and cessation words, not torment words.

In the Old Testament, four Hebrew words carry most of the weight:

- **abad** -- to perish, to be destroyed (roughly 184 occurrences)
- **shamad** -- to destroy utterly, to exterminate (roughly 90 occurrences)
- **kalah** -- to consume, to finish, to use up (roughly 206 occurrences)
- **shachath** -- to corrupt, to ruin, to decay (roughly 147 occurrences)

In the New Testament, three Greek words continue the same pattern:

- **apollymi** -- to destroy fully, to perish (roughly 92 occurrences)
- **apoleia** -- destruction, ruin, perdition (roughly 20 occurrences)
- **olethros** -- destruction, ruin (4 occurrences)

No standard lexicon defines any of these words as "torment" or "ongoing conscious suffering." They are destruction words. Their plain meaning, across every dictionary and lexicon, points to ruin and cessation.

One important finding confirms that these Old and New Testament words are directly linked: the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament (called the Septuagint, or LXX) translates the Hebrew word abad as the Greek word apollymi 141 times. This means that when New Testament authors like John and Paul use apollymi for the fate of the wicked, they are using the exact same word that Jewish translators had long used to render the Old Testament's primary word for perishing. The vocabulary chain is unbroken across both testaments.

## What Scripture Explicitly Says

The passages using this destruction vocabulary are not rare or obscure. They appear across Psalms, Job, Proverbs, the Prophets, the Gospels, and the Epistles -- from David, Asaph, Isaiah, Malachi, Hosea, Obadiah, Nahum, Jesus, Paul, Peter, James, Jude, and the author of Hebrews. This is the dominant biblical vocabulary for the fate of the wicked, used by virtually every author who addresses the topic.

**From the Psalms:**

- "The wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away" (Psalm 37:20)
- "Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be" (Psalm 37:10)
- "As wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God" (Psalm 68:2)
- "The wicked shall be destroyed for ever" (Psalm 92:7)
- "The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy" (Psalm 145:20)
- "Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be" (Psalm 59:13)
- "Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more" (Psalm 104:35)

**From the Prophets:**

- "They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish" (Isaiah 26:14)
- "The day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, leaving them neither root nor branch" (Malachi 4:1)
- "Ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet" (Malachi 4:3)
- "They shall be as though they had not been" (Obadiah 1:16)
- "They shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff driven with the whirlwind, and as the smoke out of the chimney" (Hosea 13:3)

**From Jesus and the Apostles:**

- "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16)
- "Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:28)
- "Broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction... narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life" (Matthew 7:13-14)
- "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish" (Luke 13:3,5)
- "Whose end is destruction" (Philippians 3:19)
- "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life" (Romans 6:23)
- "Punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord" (2 Thessalonians 1:9)
- "A certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries" (Hebrews 10:27)

## Three Key Patterns in the Evidence

### 1. "Perish vs. Life" Is a Structural Contrast

Across multiple authors and books, the Bible presents two and only two outcomes: life and destruction. These are not two forms of ongoing existence (blissful existence vs. miserable existence). They are opposites.

- John 3:16: perish vs. everlasting life
- Matthew 7:13-14: destruction vs. life
- Romans 6:23: death vs. eternal life
- Philippians 3:19: destruction vs. glory
- Psalm 145:20: destroy vs. preserve

The same pattern, from five different authors, presents destruction and life as antithetical outcomes.

### 2. Every Destruction Simile Depicts Something That Ceases to Exist

The Bible uses many images to illustrate what happens to the wicked: chaff burned up, wax melting, smoke dissipating, fat consumed, stubble incinerated, ashes, morning clouds and dew vanishing, smoke from a chimney passing away. Not one of these images depicts something that endures indefinitely. Every natural process named is one of dissolution and cessation.

### 3. Several Passages Explicitly State Non-Existence as the Outcome

A handful of passages go beyond destruction vocabulary and state the result plainly:

- "The wicked shall not be" (Psalm 37:10)
- "Consume them, that they may not be" (Psalm 59:13)
- "Let the wicked be no more" (Psalm 104:35)
- "They shall be as though they had not been" (Obadiah 1:16)

## The Main Challenge to the Annihilation Reading

The eternal torment view holds that the Bible's destruction vocabulary is metaphorical -- that "perish" means "exist in a ruined spiritual state," and "destroy" means "inflict irreparable loss" rather than actual cessation. Three passages are most often cited in support of this reading:

- **Matthew 25:46** -- "everlasting punishment" (the word here is *kolasis*, a punishment word, not a destruction word)
- **Revelation 14:10-11** -- "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" (the word here is *basanizo*, a torment word, in an apocalyptic vision)
- **Matthew 13:42** -- "there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth" in a furnace of fire (from the parable of the tares)

These passages deserve careful attention, but several observations limit how much weight they can carry against the destruction vocabulary:

First, Matthew 25:46 and Revelation 14:10-11 use torment and punishment words (*kolasis*, *basanizo*), not the destruction words this study examines. These are different Greek words with different definitions. The question at issue is what the *destruction* words mean, and passages using different words do not directly answer that question.

Second, on the phrase "everlasting destruction" (2 Thessalonians 1:9), the Bible itself provides a clear interpretive guide. Jude 1:7 says Sodom and Gomorrah suffered "the vengeance of eternal fire" -- yet those cities are not still burning. The eternal fire accomplished a permanent destruction; the destruction is complete, its result is irreversible. "Everlasting destruction" follows the same pattern: not an endless process of being destroyed, but a destruction whose result lasts forever. The Old Testament supports this reading: "destroyed for ever" (Psalm 92:7) and "perish for ever" (Job 20:7) use the same structure.

Third, regarding "wailing and gnashing of teeth" in Matthew 13:42: this comes from a parable (the parable of the tares). The same author, Matthew, records Jesus saying in direct didactic teaching that God "is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:28) and that the broad road "leadeth to destruction" (Matthew 7:13). Jesus' direct teaching in Matthew uses destruction vocabulary; the parabolic imagery of wailing does not override it.

The fundamental problem for the metaphorical reading is this: it requires every destruction word to mean something other than what every lexicon says it means, and every destruction simile (wax, chaff, smoke, ashes) to depict something other than what the natural process involved actually produces. The evidence on the other side -- lexical definitions, explicit non-existence statements, the Jude 1:7 example, and same-author didactic teaching -- is more direct and more extensive.

## What This Means

The Bible's vocabulary for describing the fate of the wicked is overwhelmingly a vocabulary of destruction and cessation, not a vocabulary of ongoing torment. This vocabulary is:

- **Consistent across both testaments.** The same Hebrew words the Old Testament uses are carried into the New Testament through the Greek words that Jewish translators had long chosen to render them.
- **Used by virtually every biblical author** who addresses the topic, across every genre: wisdom literature, psalms, prophecy, gospel, epistle.
- **Defined by the lexicons** as destruction, perishing, ruin -- not as torment or suffering.
- **Illustrated by similes** (chaff, wax, smoke, ashes) that uniformly depict substances that are consumed and cease to exist.
- **Explicitly glossed in several passages** as resulting in non-existence: "shall not be," "be no more," "as though they had not been."

The annihilation view reads these words at face value: destruction means destruction. The eternal torment view must read them as metaphors for ongoing existence in a ruined state. The challenge for the metaphorical reading is not simply that the plain meaning is against it, but that the passages supporting the plain meaning are more numerous, more direct, span more authors and genres, and include explicit non-existence statements that are difficult to read any other way.

## Conclusion

The dominant biblical vocabulary for the fate of the wicked is destruction vocabulary. Across roughly 743 combined occurrences, in both testaments, from more than a dozen authors, the words used are words that mean perishing, being destroyed, being consumed, and ceasing to exist. No lexicon defines any of these words as "torment." The similes that illustrate this fate depict natural processes of dissolution. Several passages state the outcome as non-existence in plain terms.

Passages that do use torment or punishment vocabulary -- such as Revelation 14:10-11 and Matthew 25:46 -- use different words from a different word family. Those passages raise legitimate questions and deserve their own careful study. But they do not change the meaning of the destruction words, which carry their plain lexical force throughout both testaments.

The weight of the destruction vocabulary, read at face value, favors the annihilation view. The eternal torment view requires the destruction vocabulary to be read as consistently metaphorical -- a reading that the lexical data, the similes, and the explicit non-existence statements all resist.
