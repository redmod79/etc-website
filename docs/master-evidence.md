# ETC5 Series — Master Evidence Tracker

*This file maintains a deduplicated master list of all E/N/I items across the entire etc5 series. It is updated after EACH study's analysis is completed.*

## Purpose

- **Prevent duplication** — Before adding a new item, check if it already exists
- **Track evidence accumulation** — See how evidence builds across studies
- **Enable instant synthesis** — etc5-18 can use this file directly instead of deduplicating 1,000+ items
- **Maintain consistency** — Same observations get the same ID across studies

## Structure

Each evidence item has:
- **Unique ID** — E001, N001, I001, etc.
- **Statement/Claim** — What the item says
- **Reference(s)** — Bible verse(s) cited
- **Classification** — Conditionalist / ECT / Neutral (for positional items)
- **Type** — (For I items only: I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D)
- **First Appeared** — Which study first cited this
- **Also In** — Which other studies cite this

## How to Use This File

### For Analysis Agents (etc5-01 through etc5-17)

After completing your CONCLUSION.md:

1. **Read this file** to see what items already exist
2. **For each E item in your study:**
   - Check if an item with the same verse + same observation already exists
   - If YES: Note the existing ID in your CONCLUSION.md (e.g., "E23 → Master E042")
   - If NO: Add it to this file with the next available ID
3. **For each N item in your study:**
   - Check if an N item with the same conclusion already exists
   - If YES: Note the existing ID
   - If NO: Add it with the next available ID
4. **For each I item in your study:**
   - Check if an I item with the same claim + same type already exists
   - If YES: Note the existing ID
   - If NO: Add it with the next available ID
5. **Update the "Also In" field** for any existing items you've cited

### For Synthesis Agent (etc5-18)

Simply read this file. All items are already deduplicated. Count by classification to generate the positional tally.

- **ECT** = directly states conscious existence after death, ongoing torment, souls/spirits experiencing awareness in post-death state
- **Neutral** = grammatical facts, statistical observations, identifications of terms/subjects, observations BOTH sides must acknowledge as textual

| E062 | "It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption [aphtharsia, G861]." The resurrection body is raised in aphtharsia; the buried body is sown in corruption. | 1 Cor 15:42 | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |

| E071 | In the new Jerusalem, "the tree of life" bears fruit and its leaves are "for the healing of the nations"; those who "do his commandments" have "right to the tree of life." Access to the tree of life is an eschatological privilege. | Rev 22:2, 14 | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |

| E079 | "None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: that he should still live for ever [chay le-olam], and not see corruption." No human can purchase endless life for another. | Psa 49:7-9 | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| E080 | "God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me." The nephesh in the power of the grave requires God's redemption — it is under the grave's power until God acts. | Psa 49:15 | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |

| E084 | "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." | 1 Cor 15:22 | Neutral | etc5-02 | etc5-03 |

| E087 | "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." Eternal life is Christ's to give; his sheep receive it from him. | John 10:28 | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| E088 | "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him." | John 3:36 | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| E089 | God commanded: "of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." The Hebrew is moth tamuth (Inf. Abs. + Qal Impf.): "dying you will die" — an intensified form conveying certainty. | Gen 2:17 | Neutral | etc5-03 | — |
| E090 | "And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die." The serpent uses the same moth tamuth construction negated (lo tamuthun) — a direct contradiction of God's statement in Gen 2:17. | Gen 3:4 | Neutral | etc5-03 | — |
| E091 | "Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression." Death's reign is described as universal and historical from Adam forward. | Rom 5:14 | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | — |
| E092 | "That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord." Sin reigns unto death; grace reigns unto eternal life. These are the two opposed outcomes stated. | Rom 5:21 | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | — |

| E096 | Daniel is told: "thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days." The personal address frames Daniel's death as rest (sleep) until "the end of the days." | Dan 12:13 | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | etc5-04; etc5-10 |
| E097 | God told Moses: "thou shalt sleep with thy fathers." God himself uses sleep-language for Moses's death. | Deut 31:16 | Neutral | etc5-03 | etc5-04 |
| E098 | "Some are fallen asleep" (v.6); "they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished" (v.18); "firstfruits of them that slept" (v.20); "we shall not all sleep" (v.51).

The LXX bridge connects the Revelation formula directly to its Hebrew source. | LXX mapping data: H6227 → G2586 (ashan → kapnos); Isa 34:10 (H6227); Rev 14:11 and Rev 19:3 (G2586) | Neutral | etc5-11 | — |

| E258 | Revelation 14:11-13: within a three-verse unit, G372 anapausis ("rest" — negated: "no rest") for beast-worshippers (v.11) is immediately followed by G373 anapauō (anapausōntai, same root) for the blessed dead who "rest from their labours" (v.13). The same Greek root appears as negated absence (v.11) and affirmed presence (v.13) within the same literary unit. | Rev 14:11 (anapausin ouk ekhousin); Rev 14:13 (anapausōntai, Aor Mid Subj 3P — same root G373) | Neutral | etc5-11 | — |
| E259 | Revelation 19:20 states the beast and false prophet were cast into the lake of fire ζῶντες (Present Active Participle of G2198 zaō = "while alive/living"). The human remnant in the same verse (Rev 19:21) were "slain with the sword" — killed before any lake-of-fire fate. Within the same narrative unit, the two supernatural entities receive alive-casting while the human armies are killed first by a different means. The beast and false prophet are present in the lake a thousand years before the general human judgment (Rev 20:12-15), bypassing the death-resurrection-judgment sequence that applies to mortals. | Rev 19:20-21 (ζῶντες V-PAP-NPM of G2198 confirmed by parsing) | Neutral | etc5-12 | — |

Three passages place the response in "outer darkness" (Mat 8:12; 22:13; 25:30); two in "furnace of fire" (Mat 13:42; 13:50); one with "hypocrites" (Mat 24:51); one in "thrust out" from the kingdom (Luk 13:28). The physically incompatible settings (outer darkness and furnace of fire) for the same formula indicate parabolic imagery rather than literal eternal-state description. None of the seven passages uses G928 (basanizō) or G929 (basanismos); none uses the for-ever-and-ever formula; the casting verbs are aorist (completed action); the emotional vocabulary describes the response at the moment of condemnation without specifying eternal duration for the weeping and gnashing. | Mat 8:12; 13:42; 13:50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luk 13:28 | Neutral | etc5-12 | — |
| E261 | Hebrews 2:14 uses G2673 (katargeō, Aorist Active Subjunctive 3rd Singular: καταργήσῃ) in a purpose clause — "in order that he might destroy/render inoperative" — to describe Christ's goal concerning the devil. G2673 appears 27 times in the NT; it is not G622 (apollumi = destroy fully/perish) and not G928 (basanizō = torment). The verb's semantic range runs from "render ineffective" (Rom 3:3: unbelief does not katargeō God's faithfulness) to "completely destroy/abolish" (1 Cor 15:24-26: Christ katargeō's all rule and authority; the last enemy death is katargeō'd). The purpose clause describes Christ's goal; whether the devil's power only or his existence is ultimately rendered inoperative is not resolved by the verb alone. | Heb 2:14 (G2673 katargeō Aorist Active Subjunctive 3rd Singular confirmed) | Neutral | etc5-12 | — |
| E262 | 1 Corinthians 15:26 identifies death as "the last enemy that shall be destroyed (καταργεῖται — Present Passive Indicative 3rd Sg, futuristic present)"; Revelation 20:14 narrates Death personified being cast into the lake of fire, with the immediate context of Rev 20:13 showing Death delivering up its dead before its own destruction; Revelation 21:4 declares "there shall be no more death (θάνατος)" as the result of the new creation. These three texts trace the same event from three vantage points: announcement of goal (1 Cor 15:26) → narrative execution (Rev 20:14) → statement of result (Rev 21:4). All three use G2288 (θάνατος) for the same power. | 1 Cor 15:26; Rev 20:14; Rev 21:4 | Conditionalist | etc5-13 | — |
| E263 | The subjects cast into the lake of fire in Rev 20:14 — θάνατος (death, G2288) and Ἅιδης (Hades, G86) — are abstract powers personified throughout Revelation: Rev 1:18 (Christ holds "the keys of hell [Hades] and of death"); Rev 6:8 (Death rides the pale horse, Hades follows). In Rev 20:13 they are described as containers — "death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them." These entities are not persons with subjective consciousness but personified realities/powers that are cast into the lake of fire in the same passage (vv.13-14) as the subsequent casting of human persons (v.15). | Rev 20:14; Rev 1:18; Rev 6:8; Rev 20:13 | Neutral | etc5-13 | — |
| E264 | Revelation 21:4 states "there shall be no more death (θάνατος, G2288)." Revelation 21:8 — four verses later within the same literary unit (Rev 21:1-8) — identifies the lake as "the second death (ὁ θάνατος ὁ δεύτερος, G2288 + G1208)." The same word θάνατος appears in both verses: the first as the redeemed's promise (no more death), the second as the wicked's fate (the second death). The promise of no death for the redeemed and the second death as the wicked's portion are stated in the same literary unit using the same lexeme. | Rev 21:4; Rev 21:8 | Neutral | etc5-13 | — |
| E265 | Revelation 21:7 states overcomers "shall inherit (κληρονομήσει — Future Active Indicative 3rd Sg of G2816 = to inherit as an heir) all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son." Revelation 21:8 immediately follows: "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part (τὸ μέρος αὐτῶν = their portion/share) in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." Consecutive verses present the two eschatological outcomes as a direct antithesis: inheritance of all things (overcomers) vs. portion in the lake/second death (wicked).

| E266 | The word λίμνη (lake, G3041, feminine noun) appears 10 times in the NT with a complete distributional split: 4 uses for the physical Lake of Gennesaret (Luke 5:1,2; 8:22,33) and 5 uses exclusively for the eschatological lake of fire in Revelation (Rev 19:20; 20:10,14,15; 21:8). The word is never used in any NT text for Hades (G86), Sheol (H7585), Gehenna (G1067), Tartarus (G5020), or any other intermediate or eschatological location. The lake of fire has exclusive lexical identity in the NT — it occupies its own terminological category. | Rev 19:20; 20:10,14,15; 21:8; Luke 5:1,2; 8:22,33 | Neutral | etc5-13 | — |

| E270 | The negative resurrection destination in John 5:29 is anastasim kriseōs — using kriseōs (G2920, N-GSF = judgment/verdict, genitive of krisis), NOT basanismos (torment). The Greek word krisis in its 34 NT occurrences functions as judicial vocabulary: 52.9% = "judgment," 23.5% = "of judgment," never = torment.

| E275 | "For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish [apollōntai — G622, V-FMI-3P: Fut Mid Ind Pl 3rd = shall perish/be destroyed] without law." Paul's own summary word for the final fate of those who sinned (Rom 2:12) is apollumi (perish/be destroyed completely), the destruction vocabulary.

The grammatical construction shows dir'on is the predicate describing the attitude of "all flesh" TOWARD the pigrê (corpses) of transgressors — it is the attitude of observers toward the condemned dead, not a conscious experience of the condemned persons themselves.

| N004 | At death, the process of Gen 2:7 reverses: the breath/spirit returns to God (Ecc 12:7) and the dust returns to earth (Gen 3:19; Psa 104:29). | E002, E012, E046 | Ecc 12:7 uses the same verb "return" (shub) for both halves. Gen 3:19 and Psa 104:29 state the dust-return. The reversal of the creation formula is the explicit death formula. | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | etc5-03; etc5-04 |
| N005 | God currently possesses immortality exclusively; no creature currently possesses it as an inherent attribute, according to 1 Tim 6:16. | E029, E054 | 1 Tim 6:16 states God ALONE (monos) has athanasia. Only 3 NT occurrences of the word; in the other two, mortals must PUT ON immortality at a future event. "Only" is unqualified. | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03 |
| N006 | Immortality (athanasia) is something mortals acquire at the resurrection, not at death or at birth. | E031, E032, E054, E055, E064, E082 | 1 Cor 15:53-54 explicitly says "this mortal MUST PUT ON immortality" — a future event. 1 Cor 15:52 specifies "at the last trump." Luk 20:36 explicitly states deathlessness is for those who "obtain the resurrection." G2349 (mortal) describes present humans in all 6 occurrences. | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03 |
| N007 | The soul (nephesh in Ezk; psyche in Rev 16:3) can die; it is not described as indestructible. | E024, E028, E043 | Ezk 18:4 states nephesh is the explicit grammatical subject of dying. Rev 16:3 states every living soul (psyche) died. Lev 21:11/Num 6:6 use nephesh met (dead soul) for a corpse. | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03 |
| N008 | God possesses the authority to destroy both soul and body; the soul is not beyond God's destructive power. | E026, E027 | Mat 10:28 explicitly contrasts men's inability to kill the soul with God's ability to destroy both soul and body. Plain contrast in the same verse. | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03 |
| N009 | Death is described as sleep in Jesus' own words and in Paul's consistent teaching across multiple epistles and in OT prophetic literature. | E047, E020, E023 | Jesus equates "sleepeth" with "is dead" (Jhn 11:11-14). Paul uses sleep-language for deceased believers (1 Cor 15:6,18,20,51; 1 Th 4:13-16). Dan 12:2 uses "sleep in the dust." | Neutral | etc5-01 | etc5-03 |
| N010 | The present natural body (psychikos soma) is corruptible and mortal; it is what is buried. The resurrection body (pneumatikos soma) is raised incorruptible. | E031, E032, E033, E036, E037, E055 | 1 Cor 15:44,53-54 explicitly states this sequence. Both sides must acknowledge the direction: from mortal to immortal, at resurrection. | Neutral | etc5-01 | — |
| N011 | The ruach/spirit in man is God's own animating breath — it belongs to him, was given by him, and returns to him at death. | E012, E045, E046, E044 | Ecc 12:7: "returns to God WHO GAVE IT" — God is the owner. Job 34:14: "his spirit and his breath" — possessive of God. Psa 104:29: "takest away their breath." Zec 12:1: God "formeth the spirit within man." | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | — |
| N012 | Humans must "seek" immortality because they do not currently possess it. | E030 | Rom 2:7 says humans seek immortality. A being that already possesses something does not seek it. The seeking implies present lack. | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | etc5-02 |
| N013 | Immortality/incorruption (athanasia, aphtharsia, aphthartos) is, in the present age, an attribute of God alone; humans are mortal (thnetos) and corruptible (phthartos) in the present age. The positive immortality-words are never applied to any present human in any NT text; the negative mortality-words are applied to the present human in every NT occurrence. | E029, E061, E066, E055, E010, E031-E032, E062-E065 | This is a complete occurrence survey of all five NT immortality/mortality words. Both sides must acknowledge the vocabulary distribution: it is an observable textual fact. | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| N014 | "Life in himself" (zoe en heauto) is a divine attribute possessed by the Father and given to the Son; it is not stated of any human. | E067 (John 5:26) | John 5:26 says the Father has life in himself and has given the Son to have life in himself. It does not say this of humans. This follows directly from what the text says (the Father and Son) and does not say (humans). | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| N015 | Man in the fallen state did not possess inherent immortality; God actively blocked access to the tree of life to prevent man from living forever. | E003 (Gen 3:22-24) | Gen 3:22-24 explicitly states God's concern was that man might "take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever." If man already had immortality, God's blocking of the tree would be purposeless. The plain reading of the text: man lacked what the tree could provide; God prevented him from getting it. | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| N016 | The three NT immortality-positive words (G110 athanasia, G861 aphtharsia, G862 aphthartos) are never applied to the present human soul, spirit, or body in any NT text. | E029, E030, E031-E032, E054, E061-E066 (complete occurrence survey) | Complete occurrence survey: G110 occurs 3x (1 Tim 6:16 = God; 1 Cor 15:53-54 = future reception). G861 occurs 8x (Rom 2:7 = sought; 1 Cor 15:42,50,53,54 = resurrection state; 2 Tim 1:10 = brought to light; Eph 6:24; Tit 2:7 = character). G862 occurs 7x (Rom 1:23; 1 Tim 1:17 = God; 1 Cor 9:25; 15:52 = future/reward; 1 Pet 1:4,23; 3:4 = inheritance/seed/character). No occurrence applies to present human body, soul, or spirit. Observable fact. | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| N017 | Eternal life is a gift from Christ, not an inherent human property; those without the Son do not have it. | E068 (1 John 5:11-12); E087 (John 10:28); E088 (John 3:36) | 1 John 5:12 states explicitly: "He that hath not the Son of God hath not life." The universal negative is unqualified. John 10:28: "I give unto them eternal life" — it is Christ's to give. Both sides must acknowledge the unqualified negative in 1 John 5:12 as what the text states. | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| N018 | Death is the universal human appointment and the direct consequence of Adam's sin passing to all humans. | E069 (Heb 9:27); E073 (Rom 5:12) | Heb 9:27: "it is appointed unto men once to die" — universal, unqualified. Rom 5:12: "death passed upon all men" — universal scope stated explicitly. Both are unqualified universal statements. | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | etc5-03 |
| N019 | Death ("the last enemy") is currently an active power; its final destruction is a future eschatological event. | E083 (1 Cor 15:26); E075 (Isa 25:8); E078 (Hos 13:14) | 1 Cor 15:26 states death is "the last enemy that SHALL BE destroyed" (future tense). Isa 25:8 is "will swallow up" (future). Paul quotes both as fulfilled AT the resurrection in 1 Cor 15:54-55 — the future fulfillment is still awaited at time of writing. | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | etc5-03; etc5-13 |
| N020 | Death entered the world through Adam's sin; before the fall, death was not the universal human condition. | E089 (Gen 2:17: death = stated consequence of specific disobedience); E073 (Rom 5:12: "by sin death entered") | Rom 5:12 states the causal sequence: sin → death entered the world. Gen 2:17 presents death as the consequence of specific disobedience, not a pre-existing condition. Before the entry of death, death was not present. This follows directly from the causal statement "death by sin" without adding any concept. | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | — |
| N021 | The second death IS the lake of fire, by explicit textual identification. | E110 (Rev 20:14: "this IS the second death"); E113 (Rev 21:8: "which IS the second death") | Both Rev 20:14 and Rev 21:8 use predicative identification to equate the second death with the lake of fire. No interpretation is required — the text provides its own definition. | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | etc5-05; etc5-09; etc5-12; etc5-13 |
| N022 | Those in the first resurrection are exempt from the second death; those not in the first resurrection face the second death (since they face the judgment and lake of fire — Rev 20:5-15). | E109 (Rev 20:6: first resurrection = exempt); E124 (Rev 20:5: rest of dead did not live until end of millennium); E111 (Rev 20:15: not in book of life cast into lake = second death) | Rev 20:6 states exemption for first resurrection participants. Rev 20:5 states the rest did not live. Rev 20:15 states those not in the book of life are cast into the lake (= second death by N021). The combination yields the conclusion without added concepts. | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | etc5-13 |
| N023 | The dead are explicitly described as lacking consciousness, thought, knowledge, praise, and participation in earthly affairs — consistently across multiple independent biblical authors. | E017 (Ecc 9:5); E018 (Ecc 9:6); E019 (Ecc 9:10); E013 (Psa 146:4); E014 (Psa 115:17); E015 (Psa 6:5); E016 (Psa 88:10-12); E022 (Isa 38:18-19); E020 (Job 14:12); E021 (Job 14:21) | Each statement explicitly asserts something the dead do NOT do: no knowledge, no thoughts, no praise, no remembrance, no participation in earthly affairs. Multiple independent authors (Qohelet, multiple psalmists, Hezekiah, Job) make these statements without qualification shared by independent witnesses. | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | etc5-04; etc5-05; etc5-09; etc5-10 |
| N024 | Job 14:13-15 frames death as a state of unconscious waiting in the grave until a future call — not as a period of continued active existence. | E094 (Job 14:13-15: "I will wait, till my change come; thou shalt call, and I will answer thee"); E020 (Job 14:12: "they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep") | Job describes his expected experience during death as "waiting" — in the grave, until the call comes. The waiting = the asleep state of v.12 (shall not awake, raised out of sleep). The future "call" = the resurrection event. Same passage, same author, connecting verses 12 and 13-15. | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | etc5-04 |
| N025 | Between death and resurrection, the dead are in a state of "not living" — this is the explicit framework Revelation uses for the period between death and the first resurrection. | E124 (Rev 20:5: "the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished") | Rev 20:5 directly states that the dead "lived not again until" — the temporal frame "not living" covers the entire period between death and the first resurrection. The same word ezesan (lived) is used in v.4 (martyrs lived at resurrection) and negated in v.5 (rest of dead lived not). Both sides must acknowledge this as what the text states. | Conditionalist | etc5-04 | etc5-10 |
| N026 | Hades is a temporary holding state that (a) receives the dead at death, (b) holds them until resurrection, and (c) delivers them up at the resurrection and is then itself destroyed. | E131 (Acts 2:31: soul was in hades until resurrection); E134 (Rev 20:13: hades delivers up the dead); E110 (Rev 20:14: death and hades cast into lake of fire) | Three independent statements combine without any added concept: the soul goes to hades (Acts 2:31 confirms presence in hades until resurrection), hades holds the dead until judgment (Rev 20:13), hades is abolished at judgment (Rev 20:14). Together these yield the model: hades = temporary holding → resurrection → abolition. | Conditionalist | etc5-04 | etc5-05; etc5-09; etc5-10; etc5-13 |
| N027 | Sheol and hades refer to the same reality across the two testaments. | E138 (LXX translates sheol as hades 58/67 times, PMI 33.87); E131 (Acts 2:31 quotes Ps 16:10 sheol as hades); E135 (Ps 16:10 = sheol passage quoted by Peter using hades); 1 Cor 15:55 (Hos 13:14 sheol quoted as hades) | The LXX translation frequency (E138) demonstrates the translators treated the terms as equivalent; NT writers quote OT sheol passages using hades and apply them to the same reality (Acts 2:27/31, 1 Cor 15:55). Both sides must acknowledge the lexical and exegetical equivalence as a textual fact. | Neutral | etc5-05 | etc5-16 |
| N028 | Gehenna and sheol/hades are distinct terms describing different stages in the eschatological sequence: sheol/hades = the current pre-judgment state of the dead; gehenna = the post-judgment final fate symbol. | N026 (hades = temporary pre-judgment state); E110 (hades ends at judgment); all 12 gehenna occurrences (eschatological judgment language throughout) | N026 establishes hades as temporary and pre-judgment. The 12 gehenna passages uniformly describe eschatological final judgment outcomes, not the current state of the dead. Rev 20:13-14 sequences: hades holds → judgment → hades destroyed. The temporal distinction follows directly from the content of each group of passages without added concepts. | Neutral | etc5-05 | etc5-16 |
| N029 | "Eternal fire" in biblical usage denotes a fire whose result is permanent and irrevocable — not a fire that continues burning forever — as established by the Bible's own cross-reference. | E147 (Jude 1:7: Sodom = "eternal fire"; 2 Pet 2:6: same event = "turned to ashes") | Jude 1:7 and 2 Pet 2:6 are statements by the same author about the same event: one calls it "eternal fire," the other describes the result as ashes. The conclusion requires no added concept: if eternal fire on Sodom produced ashes, the "eternal" character refers to the permanence of the destructive result, not the ongoing process. | Neutral | etc5-05 | etc5-06; etc5-07; etc5-08; etc5-11; etc5-13; etc5-14; etc5-15; etc5-16 |
| N030 | G622 (apollumi) and G684 (apoleia) are structurally placed as the direct antithesis of G2222 (zoe, life) throughout the NT eschatological vocabulary — they occupy the opposite pole from "having life" in every occurrence where they appear together. | E114 (Jn 3:16: not perish BUT have life); E165 (Mat 7:13-14: road to destruction vs. road to life); E166 (Gal 6:8: reap corruption vs. reap eternal life); E167 (Heb 10:39: perdition vs. saving of the soul) | Four independent texts by different authors (John, Matthew/Jesus, Paul, author of Hebrews) place apollumi/apoleia on the opposite side from zoe. Observable structural pattern both sides must acknowledge. | Conditionalist | etc5-06 | — |
| N031 | The NT writers using apollumi for eschatological destruction were using vocabulary that the LXX had already established as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "perish/be destroyed" vocabulary in the Psalms and Prophets. | E170 (LXX mapping data: H6 → G622, 141x, PMI 6.14) | The quantitative LXX correspondence (141x, PMI 6.14) is the dominant cross-testament correspondence for either word. That the NT uses the LXX's established vocabulary for eschatological destruction is an unavoidable lexical observation. | Neutral | etc5-06 | — |
| N032 | The Hebrew destruction terms (abad, shamad, kalah, karat) and the Greek NT destruction terms (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora) form a unified semantic field across both testaments, consistently describing cessation, ruin, and loss rather than ongoing conscious torment. | E151, E153, E154, E162 (abad/shamad/karat in Psalms); E151, E156–E159, E163, E175 (multiple OT destruction passages); E114, E116, E164, E165, E168, E173, E174 (NT apollumi/apoleia/olethros); E170, E171 (LXX bridge data); N031 | Observable from the complete lexical survey: none of the destruction terms is ever used in any context to mean "ongoing conscious torment." The LXX bridge confirms cross-testament semantic continuity. | Conditionalist | etc5-06 | etc5-17 |
| N033 | Basanizo (G928) and basanismos (G929) are lexically distinct from the destruction vocabulary (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora) — no NT text uses both vocabulary sets to describe the same event or the same subject. | E171 (LXX: destruction terms never translated as basanizo/basanismos); E172 (basanismos occurs only in Revelation); E181 (G622 = 92 NT occ, eschatological basanizo confined to Revelation); E150, E149 (torment passages) vs. E114, E116, E165, E168 (destruction passages) | Complete occurrence survey shows the two vocabulary sets appear in different passages with different subjects and never together in the same judgment description. Observable lexical-distributional fact. | Neutral | etc5-06 | etc5-08; etc5-11; etc5-12; etc5-14; etc5-15; etc5-16 |
| N034 | The duration olam denotes in any given use is contextually determined by the nature of the subject to which it is applied, not by the word itself. | E191 (Hab 3:6: same verse uses olam/ad for mountains that are scattered AND for God's ways that endure — BHSA parsing confirmed); E187 (Exo 21:6: le-olam = servant's lifetime, bounded by mortality); E189 (Jon 2:6: le-olam = 72 hours); E190 (Isa 32:14-15: olam + "until" bounding clause) | The same word in Hab 3:6 applies simultaneously to mountains that bow/shatter AND to God's ways that endure — in the same verse. Both sides must acknowledge this as a textual fact. The only explanation is that the word adapts to its referent's nature. This is observable, not a theological inference. | Neutral | etc5-07 | etc5-08; etc5-11; etc5-15; etc5-17 |
| N035 | NT G166 (aionios, "eternal/everlasting") carries the semantic range of Hebrew H5769 (olam), including the contextually-determined quality, because the LXX systematically used G166 to translate H5769. | E195 (LXX bridge: H5769 → G166 100x, PMI 5.67 — dominant, non-accidental association) | A PMI score of 5.67 at 100 occurrences is a statistically dominant, non-accidental correspondence. NT writers who used G166 adopted the LXX's vocabulary, which was developed specifically to translate H5769 olam. Both sides must acknowledge the lexical inheritance. | Neutral | etc5-07 | etc5-08; etc5-11; etc5-15 |
| N036 | Aionios (G166) cannot be inherently forward-pointing endless, because it demonstrably refers to past elapsed time in three NT passages by two different authors. A word that looks backward to past ages cannot be defined as inherently "pointing only forward without end." | E197 (BLB definition explicitly states past-time use: "also used of past time, or past and future as well"); E203 (Tit 1:2: same verse, both backward and forward applications); E204 (Rom 16:25: chronois aioniois = "since the world began" — past ages); E205 (2Tim 1:9: pro chronon aionion = "before the world began"); N035 (inherited from olam, which similarly looks backward) | Three independent past-time uses from two different authors (Paul twice, Titus). The BLB definition itself explicitly states the past-time function. No interpretation is required; the past-time uses are the textual data. | Neutral | etc5-08 | — |
| N037 | The Greek morphological structure of aionios (aion + -ios = denominal adjective "pertaining to the age") is not an alpha-privative formation and therefore does not inherently assert infinite, unending duration. The words that inherently assert unending duration in Greek are alpha-privative (athanasia, aphtharsia, athanatos). Aionios is not in that category. | E197 (aionios derives from aion, not from alpha + ending); E199 (aidios, from aei = always, is the word for inherent endlessness — different derivation); E200 (aidios only 2 NT occurrences); E201 (Paul used the different, inherently-endless word aidios when expressing God's intrinsic everduring power in Rom 1:20) | The morphological analysis is an observable, non-controversial fact about Greek word formation. Both aionios and aidios are classified as adjectives in NT Greek lexicons with different etymological origins. That Paul used two different words for different purposes is an observable textual fact. | Neutral | etc5-08 | — |
| N038 | Even on a literal reading of Luke 16:19-31, the location described in verse 23 is hades (G86, the temporary pre-resurrection holding state per N026), not gehenna or the lake of fire. The passage therefore cannot, even if taken as entirely literal, directly establish the *final* post-judgment fate of the wicked as eternal conscious torment — it describes at most a pre-resurrection intermediate state in hades, which is itself destroyed at the final judgment (Rev 20:14). | N026 (hades = temporary pre-resurrection state, holding → delivers up → destroyed); E134 (Rev 20:13: hades delivers up the dead at judgment); E110 (Rev 20:14: hades cast into lake of fire); E222 (Luk 16:28: five living brothers confirm the pre-resurrection setting) | N026 establishes that hades is temporary and pre-judgment. The five living brothers in v.28 place the narrative explicitly in the pre-resurrection period. Rev 20:13-14 sequences the end of hades at the final judgment. These combine without added concepts: Luke 16 describes pre-judgment hades, not the post-judgment lake of fire. | Neutral | etc5-09 | — |
| N039 | In Revelation's literary mode, inanimate non-conscious entities are depicted as speaking, because Rev 16:7 attributes speech to the altar (thusiasterion = inanimate structure). Speech attributed to entities in Revelation's visionary genre does not by itself require those entities to be conscious. | E233 (Rev 16:7: altar speaks); E231 (Rev 1:1: book communicates through signs) | Rev 16:7 attributes direct speech to the altar — an inanimate object. Rev 1:1 identifies the book's mode as sign-communication. Both sides must acknowledge that speech is attributed to the altar in Rev 16:7 and that the altar is not a conscious being. It follows necessarily that Revelation's visionary genre can attribute speech to non-conscious entities. | Neutral | etc5-10 | — |
| N040 | The martyrs of Revelation 6:9-11 and the martyrs of Revelation 20:4-5 are the same group, identified by shared vocabulary: tas psychas, dia tēn martyrian, dia ton logon tou Theou (all present in both passages). | E240 (Rev 20:4 vocabulary: tas psychas, martyrian Iēsou, logon tou Theou — same terms as Rev 6:9); E239 (same sacrificial context); E051 (Rev 6:9-11) | The vocabulary overlap (tas psychas — identical form; dia ton logon tou Theou — identical phrase; martyria — testimony shared) is observable without interpretation. Both passages describe the same martyred class. Both sides must acknowledge the vocabulary identification. | Neutral | etc5-10 | — |
| N041 | The martyrs' transition from the under-the-altar state (Rev 6:9) to the living-and-reigning state (Rev 20:4) is explicitly called "the first resurrection" (Rev 20:5). Their "living" (ezēsan) is a resurrection event, not an intermediate conscious state. | E240 (Rev 20:4: they lived); E241 (Rev 20:5: "This IS the first resurrection"); N040 (same group) | Rev 20:5 explicitly and definitionally identifies the "living" (ezēsan) of the martyrs as "the first resurrection" (anastasis hē prōtē). This is a self-definition: the text defines its own term. N040 establishes it is the same group as Rev 6:9. The implication — that the martyrs' living is a resurrection event — requires no added concept beyond accepting the text's own definition. | Conditionalist | etc5-10 | — |
| N042 | The abolition of Death (personified, θάνατος G2288) in Rev 20:14 is the narrative execution of the goal announced in 1 Cor 15:26 ("the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death"), and its direct result is the "no more death" state of Rev 21:4. | E262 (the three-text sequence: 1 Cor 15:26 → Rev 20:14 → Rev 21:4); E083 (1 Cor 15:26: death = last enemy to be abolished); E110 (Rev 20:14: Death cast into lake = second death); E112 (Rev 21:4: no more death in new creation) | All three texts use the same Greek word (θάνατος, G2288) for the power called "death." 1 Cor 15:26 announces death as the last enemy to be abolished (no alternative interpretation of the sequence in 1 Cor 15:24-26 prevents this); Rev 20:14 is the only NT text that narrates the abolition of Death as an event (Death is cast into the lake); Rev 21:4 is the immediate result-statement ("no more death"). The chain requires only shared vocabulary and narrative sequence — no theological framework is imported. | Conditionalist | etc5-13 | — |
| N043 | The evaluation standard at the Great White Throne (Rev 20:12-13) is works (erga), determined by written record in books, using the judicial verdict verb krinō — not the torment verb basanizō. Both sides must acknowledge these words appear in the text. | E268 (Rev 20:12: ekrithēsan = krinō + erga — judicial vocabulary confirmed); E111 (Rev 20:15: cast into lake of fire); E110 (Rev 20:14: second death) | Rev 20:12 twice uses "according to their works" and the verb ekrithēsan (krinō, G2919 = to judge/evaluate/render verdict). The words are observable in the text; their occurrence is not disputed. What the absence of basanizō implies for the nature of the punishment is I-tier. | Neutral | etc5-14 | — |
| N044 | Paul's own summary word for the fate of sinners in Romans 2 is apollumi (perish completely/be destroyed), the destruction vocabulary, appearing in the same passage (v.12) as the wrath/indignation/tribulation/anguish language of vv.8-9. Both sides must acknowledge what Greek word Paul uses in Romans 2:12. | E275 (Rom 2:12: apollōntai = G622, fut mid ind pl 3rd — confirmed); E274 (Rom 2:8-9: orgē/thumos/thlipsis/stenochōria in same passage) | Paul writes both vv.8-9 (judgment vocabulary) and v.12 (apollumi) in the same argument under the same authorship. The word apollōntai (G622 = perish/be destroyed) in v.12 is an observable lexical fact. That Paul uses destruction vocabulary as his summary word in the same passage as the wrath language is beyond dispute. The implication for the final state is I-tier. | Conditionalist | etc5-14 | — |
| N045 | The negative resurrection in John 5:29 is named "resurrection of judgment/condemnation" (anastasim kriseōs) using krisis (G2920) — not anastasim basanismou (resurrection of torment). The underlying Greek word is kriseōs (G2920, N-GSF), confirmed by N1904 parsing. Both sides must acknowledge this lexical fact. | E270 (Jhn 5:29: kriseōs = G2920, N-GSF confirmed by N1904 Greek parsing); G2920 occurrence data (34 NT uses, all judicial vocabulary, none = torment) | The Greek word in John 5:29 is kriseōs (genitive of krisis, G2920). This is an unambiguous lexical identification confirmed by parsing. The occurrence data (34 NT uses, consistently judicial vocabulary) is a statistical fact. Both sides must acknowledge the word is krisis, not basanismos. What the krisis vocabulary implies about the experiential content of the outcome is I-tier. | Neutral | etc5-14 | — |
| N046 | The fire in Hebrews 10:27 is described by its consuming/devouring action toward adversaries: esthiein (G2068, V-PAN = Pres Act Inf = to eat/devour) — not basanizō (to torment). Both sides must acknowledge that Heb 10:27 uses esthiō, not basanizō. | E272 (Heb 10:27: esthiein = G2068, V-PAN confirmed by N1904 Greek parsing); E180 (Rev 20:9: katephagen = devoured, the same consumption vocabulary applied to fire acting on humans at judgment) | N1904 parsing of Heb 10:27 gives esthiein (G2068, V-PAN). G2068 is the eat/devour verb. G928 (basanizō = to torment) does not appear. This is an observable vocabulary fact. Both sides must acknowledge that esthiō (not basanizō) describes the fire's action in Heb 10:27. The significance of this vocabulary distinction is I-tier. | Neutral | etc5-14 | — |

## INFERENCES (I)

### I-A (Evidence-Extending)

*All components from E/N tables; inference only because it systematizes (#5) multiple items into a broader claim.*

| ID | Claim | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria | Classification | First Appeared | Also In |
|----|-------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| IA001 | The Bible teaches that humans are a psychosomatic unity — an indivisible whole person — not a body housing a separable soul-substance. | Gen 2:7 (man became a nephesh — E001, E053); Jas 2:26 (body without spirit = dead — E059); 1 Th 5:23 (three terms together = whole person — E040); Lev 21:11 (nephesh met = corpse — E043). The creation and death formulas treat the whole person as the unit. | No single verse states "humans are a psychosomatic unity." Systematizes E001, E053, E059, E040 into an anthropological framework. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | — |
| IA002 | The Bible teaches that the soul/nephesh is the whole living person, not an immaterial component added to the body. | Gen 2:7 (man BECAME a nephesh — E001, E053); Gen 1:20,21,24 (animals are nephesh — E004); Lev 21:11 (dead body is nephesh met — E043); Ecc 9:5 (the dead know nothing — E017). Nephesh denotes the whole living being. | Derives entirely from E/N items but the categorical "whole person" claim goes beyond any single verse. | #5 (systematizing); optionally #4a (SIS) | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | — |
| IA003 | The Bible teaches that humans do not possess an inherently immortal soul; the soul is mortal until God grants immortality at the resurrection. | E024 (nephesh dies); E026 (God can destroy soul); E028 (every living psyche died); E029 (God alone has immortality); E031 (mortal must put on immortality); N005, N006, N007, N008. | No single verse states "humans do not possess an inherently immortal soul." Systematic conclusion of E/N evidence from multiple passages and both testaments. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03 |
| IA004 | The Bible teaches that the distinguishing feature of humans relative to animals is the image of God (tselem/eikon), not nephesh or ruach, which animals share. | E006, E007, E008 (image of God exclusively human — N003); E004, E005, E009, E010 (nephesh/ruach shared with animals — N002). | Derived entirely from N002 and N003 combined. No single verse states "image of God is the distinguishing feature." | #5 (systematizing N002, N003, E006-E010) | Neutral | etc5-01 | — |
| IA005 | The Bible teaches that the state of the dead is one of complete unawareness — no thought, no knowledge, no praise — until the resurrection. | E013 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4); E017 (dead know not any thing — Ecc 9:5); E018-E019 (love/hatred/envy perished; no work/knowledge in grave — Ecc 9:6,10); E020-E021 (man lies down, rises not; knoweth it not — Job 14:12,21); E014, E015, E016, E022 (dead do not praise, no remembrance, land of forgetfulness — Psa 115:17; 6:5; 88:10-12; Isa 38:18-19); N009 (death = sleep consistently). | No single verse states "the dead are unconscious." Systematic conclusion of accumulated E/N pattern across Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Job, Isaiah, and NT sleep texts. | #5 (systematizing); #4a (SIS: Ecc 9:5 explicitly interprets sleep as lack of knowledge) | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03; etc5-04; etc5-05 |
| IA006 | The image of God in humans consists primarily in relational/functional representation (dominion over creation as God's vice-regent) rather than in a specific soul-substance. | E006, E007 (image + dominion linked — Gen 1:26-28); E060 (post-flood image grounds human dignity — Gen 9:6); 2 Cor 3:18; Col 3:10 (renewal in/into the image). | No verse explicitly defines what the image consists in. The claim requires synthesizing the image-dominion link and the renewal language. All components in E/N tables. | #5 (systematizing) | Neutral | etc5-01 | — |
| IA007 | The sleep metaphor for death implies unconsciousness in the intermediate state. | E047 (Jesus: "Lazarus sleepeth" = "Lazarus is dead" — Jhn 11:11-14); E020 (man lies down, rises not — Job 14:12); E023 (sleep in the dust of the earth — Dan 12:2); N009 (death = sleep consistently). | No verse states "the sleep metaphor proves unconsciousness." Inferring that the properties of natural sleep (unconsciousness) carry over to the metaphor. | #5 (systematizing); #4a (Ecc 9:5 explicitly interprets sleep as lack of knowledge) | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | etc5-04 |
| IA008 | The soul has no conscious existence between death and resurrection because all soul-components return to their source (dust to earth, spirit to God), leaving no continuing conscious entity. | E002 (dust to dust — Gen 3:19); E012 (spirit to God — Ecc 12:7); E013 (thoughts perish — Psa 146:4); E017 (dead know not any thing — Ecc 9:5); N001 (man = result of two components; separation = dissolution); N004 (death reverses creation formula). | Systematic conclusion combining E/N items into a positive claim about the absence of any continuing conscious entity. No single verse states this. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | — |
| IA009 | The NT Greek vocabulary of immortality (athanasia, aphtharsia, aphthartos) consistently places immortality/incorruption as an attribute of God and the future resurrection state — never as a present human attribute — while vocabulary of mortality (thnetos, phthartos) uniformly describes the present human condition. | N013, N016 (complete occurrence surveys of all 5 words); E029 (1 Tim 6:16); E061 (1 Tim 1:17); E066 (Rom 1:23); E031-E032 (1 Cor 15:53-54); E064 (1 Cor 15:52); E082 (Luk 20:35-36); E055 (all thnetos occurrences). | No single verse states "the vocabulary pattern demonstrates X." Systematizes complete occurrence data for five NT words into a vocabulary-distribution theological conclusion. All components are in E/N tables. | #5 (systematizing vocabulary data) | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| IA010 | The tree of life narrative (Gen 2-3; Rev 2:7; Rev 22:2,14) consistently presents immortality as external to human nature, conditional on access, and divinely mediated — not as an inherent human property. | E003 (Gen 3:22-24: tree blocked — man lacked immortality the tree could provide); N015 (man lacked immortality); E070 (Rev 2:7: tree promised to overcomers as future reward); E071 (Rev 22:2,14: tree in new creation, access for those with right to it); Gen 2:9 (tree planted in Eden, accessible pre-fall without prohibition). | No single verse states "immortality is not an inherent human property" as a comprehensive conclusion. Systematizes the entire tree of life narrative across Gen 2-3 and Rev 2,22 into a theological conclusion about the conditional, external nature of immortality. | #5 (systematizing narrative arc) | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| IA011 | The Bible teaches that eternal life is available exclusively through the Son; those who do not have the Son do not have life. | E068 (1 John 5:11-12: life is in the Son; having/not having Son = having/not having life); E067 (John 5:26: life in himself = divine attribute); E087 (John 10:28: "I give unto them eternal life"); E088 (John 3:36: not believing Son = not seeing life); E072 (Rom 6:23: eternal life is a gift through Christ); N017 (eternal life is a gift from Christ, not inherent). | No single verse states "eternal life is available exclusively through the Son" as a comprehensive doctrine. Systematizes John 5:26, 1 John 5:11-12, John 10:28, John 3:36, and Rom 6:23 into a Christocentric-exclusivity claim. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-02 | — |
| IA012 | The Bible teaches that "death" in Scripture has a unified underlying meaning: the condition of being cut off from the source of life (God), which expresses itself in three registers — physical, spiritual, and eschatological — rather than being three unrelated homonyms. | E101-E104 (Eph 2:1,5; Col 2:13; 1 Tim 5:6; Rom 8:6: spiritual death = alienation from God while alive); E002 (Gen 3:19: physical death = dust returns); E110, E113 (Rev 20:14; 21:8: second death = lake of fire); N020 (three registers attested); E114 (Jhn 3:16: not perish vs. eternal life); E072 (Rom 6:23: wages = death; gift = eternal life) | No single verse states "death is the unified condition of being cut off from God's life." This is a theological synthesis organizing the three attested senses into a coherent framework. All components are in E/N tables. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | — |
| IA013 | The Bible teaches that the "second death" is actual death — final and irreversible destruction of the whole person — rather than a permanent state of ongoing conscious torment. | E110 (Rev 20:14: second death = lake of fire); E111 (Rev 20:15: cast into lake); E026 (Matt 10:28: God destroys both soul and body — apollymi); E114 (John 3:16: not perish vs. eternal life — apollymi); E116 (2 Th 1:9: everlasting destruction — olethron); E117 (2 Pet 2:12: utterly perish); N021, N022 (second death = lake of fire; wicked face it). Consistent vocabulary: apollymi, olethros, and the name "death" itself. | No single verse states "the second death is annihilation." Systematizes the destruction/death vocabulary from multiple passages. The claim aligns with all E/N items using destruction vocabulary and the explicit naming of the outcome as "death." | #5 (systematizing destruction vocabulary) | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | etc5-05; etc5-06 |
| IA014 | The Bible teaches that the death/life antithesis throughout Paul and John establishes that death and life are ontological opposites, and therefore the wicked's final fate is genuine death (cessation of existence), not another form of life. | E092 (Rom 5:21: sin unto death/grace unto life); E072 (Rom 6:23: wages death/gift eternal life); E083 (1 Cor 15:26: last enemy = death); E114 (John 3:16: perish vs. eternal life — apollymi); E105 (Jhn 5:24: passed from death unto life); E068 (1 John 5:11-12: have/not have life corresponds to have/not have Son); E126-E127 (vocabulary survey: thanatos and zoe are antithetical throughout). | No single verse states "death means cessation and therefore the wicked's final fate is cessation." Systematizes the death/life antithesis pattern across both testaments. Applying the pattern to eschatological outcomes requires the additional step of extending the antithesis to the second death. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-03 | — |
| IA015 | The sequential structure of Acts 7:59-60 — spirit commended to God (v.59), then "fell asleep" (v.60) — demonstrates that within Luke's narrative framework, the act of committing one's spirit to God at the moment of death results in sleep, not in immediate conscious paradise-experience. | Acts 7:59 (E049: "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit") and Acts 7:60 (E100: "he fell asleep") are two consecutive statements at the moment of death. | No single verse states "spirit-commendation leads to sleep." Systematizes two consecutive verses and draws a conclusion about the relationship between the two events using #4a SIS (same narrative, same moment — the outcome description [sleep] governs the preceding act [spirit-commendation]). | #5 (systematizing sequential verses); #4a (SIS: same narrative, same moment — sleep as the described outcome of the spirit-departure event) | Conditionalist | etc5-04 | — |
| IA016 | The four "hell" words (sheol, hades, gehenna, tartaroo) describe distinct realities that are not interchangeable, and none of the four terms inherently carries the semantic content of "eternal conscious torment." | E137-E148 (this study); E026 (Matt 10:28 — apollumi); E141-E143 (Isa 66:24, apollumi, torment vocabulary absent); N027, N028, N029 (sheol=hades; gehenna≠hades; eternal fire = permanent result); N026 (hades = temporary); E145-E146 (tartaroo = angels, pre-judgment only) | No single verse states "these four terms are distinct and non-synonymous." Systematizes the word-study data for four separate lexical items (occurrence counts, etymology, LXX data, associated vocabulary, temporal scope) into a comparative vocabulary conclusion. | #5 (systematizing word-study data) | Conditionalist | etc5-05 | etc5-16 |
| IA017 | Because the source text of the Mark 9 gehenna imagery (Isa 66:24) depicts fire and worm acting on corpses (pigrê), the gehenna fire imagery in Mark 9 is grounded in the consumption and destruction of those who are already dead, rather than the ongoing torment of conscious persons. | E141 (Isa 66:24: objects = corpses); E144 (Mark 9:48 quotes Isa 66:24 directly); E026 (Matt 10:28: apollumi = destroy); E142 (the verb is destroy, not torment); E143 (torment vocabulary absent from all gehenna passages) | Combines E141 + E144 (direct OT-to-NT quotation linkage) with E026/E142/E143 (vocabulary data) into an interpretive claim about what the imagery implies for the nature of the judgment. The inference step is bringing the OT source-text context (corpses) to bear on the NT quotation's meaning. | #5 (systematizing multiple items); #4a (SIS: the OT source text [Isa 66:24, same passage quoted] establishes that the objects of worm/fire are corpses — the source governs the imagery) | Conditionalist | etc5-05 | — |
| IA018 | The Bible teaches that the destruction vocabulary (apollumi, abad, etc.) consistently describes cessation of existence — the wicked cease to exist — rather than ongoing conscious torment in another state. | E151 (Ps 37:20 abad + kalah + smoke imagery); E152 (Ps 37:10 non-existence particle: "not be"); E155 (Ps 37:36 "he was not"); E158 (Obad 1:16 "as though they had not been"); E160 (Ps 104:35 consumed → be no more); E176 (Ezk 28:19 "never shalt thou be any more"); E177 (Isa 41:11-12 "as nothing"); N030, N032 | No single verse states "the wicked cease to exist" as a comprehensive doctrine. Systematizes the destruction vocabulary pattern + non-existence expressions across both testaments into a positive doctrinal claim. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-06 | — |
| IA019 | The two vocabulary sets — destruction (apollumi, apoleia, olethros, phthora, abad, shamad, kalah, karat) and torment (basanizo, basanismos) — describe different outcomes for different subjects in Revelation, not a unified description of the same event for all the wicked. | E150 (Rev 14:10-11: torment = beast-worshippers, specific tribulation class); E149 (Rev 20:10: torment = devil/beast/false prophet, three named entities); E180 (Rev 20:9: nations = devoured/consumed, consumption vocabulary); Rev 20:15 (human wicked cast into lake without torment language); N033 (lexical separation confirmed); E114, E116, E165, E168 (destruction vocabulary for all the wicked broadly) | Systematizes the different subjects + vocabulary choices in Revelation into a broader claim about different outcomes. Requires the inference step that vocabulary choice reflects outcome distinction. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-06 | etc5-12 |
| IA020 | The biblical self-interpretation of "everlasting destruction" (olethron aionion, 2 Th 1:9) is that aionion modifies the permanence of the result of destruction, not the ongoing duration of a process of torment. | E116 (2 Th 1:9: olethron aionion — aionion attaches to the destruction noun); N029 (existing: eternal fire on Sodom = ashes, i.e., permanent result, not ongoing process); E147 (existing: Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6 = eternal fire = ashes). The aionion modifier functions identically for "eternal fire" (= ashes) and "everlasting destruction" (= permanent ruin). | Applies N029 (eternal fire = permanent result) to the aionion-olethros construction. The Bible's own definition of "eternal fire" as a permanent result (via Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6) governs the parallel construction "everlasting destruction." | #5 (systematizing); #4a (SIS: Jude/2 Pet define "eternal" fire as producing ashes — same aionion-adjective pattern) | Conditionalist | etc5-06 | etc5-08; etc5-11 |
| IA021 | The OT punishment passages using olam (H5769) describe permanent, irreversible outcomes whose duration is determined by the subject's nature, not assertions of endless ongoing conscious activity. | E162 (Ps 92:7: shamad + abad + ad-olam = destroyed for ever); E156, E157 (Mal 4:1,3: stubble burned → ashes); E132 (Jer 51:39: perpetual sleep, shnat-olam); E194 (Jer 51:57: shall not wake, lo yaqitzu, same qits root as Dan 12:2); E182 (Isa 34:10: smoke = permanent desolation of Edom's land); E192 (Isa 34:11-17: animals dwelling in desolation immediately after smoke-for-ever); E193 (Dan 12:2: dir'on = corpse-imagery connection via Isa 66:24); N034 (duration = nature of subject, established by Hab 3:6) | No single verse states "olam in punishment contexts describes permanent result not ongoing process." Systematizes the pattern across Category B punishment passages into a category-wide claim. All components in E/N tables. The inference step is extending the single-verse logic (N034) to the punishment category. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-07 | — |
| IA022 | The NT distribution of aionios (G166) across (a) past-time uses (Rom 16:25; 2Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2), (b) human-relationship use bounded by a mortal lifespan (Phm 1:15), (c) completed-event uses with permanent results (Heb 9:12 ephapax; Heb 6:2 verdict; Heb 5:9 accomplished salvation), and (d) Sodom's fire use demonstrating permanent-result-not-ongoing-process (Jude 1:7 + 2Pet 2:6 = ashes) — confirms that aionios is a subject-dependent adjective whose duration is contextually determined by the nature of its referent, consistent with N034 and N035. | E203, E204, E205 (past-time: 3 uses, 2 authors); E206 (mortal human: Phm 1:15); E207 (event-noun: Heb 9:12, ephapax); N029 (Sodom's fire = permanent result, established from etc5-05); N034 (subject-dependent duration from Hab 3:6, established from etc5-07); N035 (LXX inheritance, established from etc5-07); E197 (definition acknowledges bidirectionality); E218 (aion root appears alongside aionios in Mrk 10:30, showing derivational link) | No single verse states "aionios is subject-dependent." Systematizes the full pattern of NT aionios usage across four distinct subject-categories into a lexical-semantic conclusion. All components are in E/N tables. The inference step is treating the aggregate distribution as evidence for the semantic mechanism. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-08 | — |
| IA023 | The Great White Throne judgment (Rev 20:11-15) establishes that all unsaved humans are cast into the lake of fire/second death after forensic judgment according to works — and the complete absence of torment vocabulary for humans in Rev 20:11-15 is consistent with the conditionalist reading (lake = second death = actual death). | E268 (Rev 20:12: works-based judicial judgment, krinō vocabulary confirmed); E111 (Rev 20:15: cast into lake of fire); E110 (Rev 20:14: lake = second death); N043 (Great White Throne judgment = forensic/judicial — krinō + erga); IA013 (pre-existing: second death = actual death) | Systematizes E268, E111, E110, N043 into the conditionalist reading of the Great White Throne. All components are E/N items; the inference step is claiming the resulting picture is consistent with the conditionalist reading of the lake as second death. No E/N item is required to mean something other than its lexical value. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-14 | — |
| IA024 | The complete absence of basanizō/basanismos from every major judgment passage (Rev 20:12; Jhn 5:29; 2Th 1:9; Heb 10:27; Heb 6:2; Rom 2:8-9; Acts 24:15; Rev 11:18; Mat 12:36-37; 2Co 5:10) — combined with the presence of destruction vocabulary (apollumi, krinō, esthiō, diaphtheirō, olethros) in every other judgment passage — indicates the torment vocabulary is specifically applied to three named supernatural entities (Rev 20:10) and a specific tribulation-era class (Rev 14:10-11), while destruction vocabulary governs the general human judgment. | N033 (destruction and torment vocabularies are lexically distinct — established etc5-06); E272 (Heb 10:27: esthiein = consumption vocabulary); E276 (Rev 11:18: diaphtheirō = destroy utterly); E275 (Rom 2:12: apollōntai = perish); E274 (Rom 2:8-9: orgē/thumos — no basanismos); E270 (Jhn 5:29: kriseōs — no basanismos); E268 (Rev 20:12: krinō — no basanizō); E210 (2Th 1:9: olethron — no basanismos); IA019 (pre-existing: vocabulary distribution across Revelation, established etc5-06) | Systematizes the complete vocabulary survey across ten major judgment passages into a pattern statement. All components are E/N items. Extends IA019 (Revelation vocabulary distribution) across the full NT judgment corpus surveyed in this study. The inference step is treating the aggregate absence of basanizō + aggregate presence of destruction vocabulary as evidence for a systematic distinction. | #5 (systematizing) | Conditionalist | etc5-14 | — |
| IA025 | The biblical judgment passages consistently describe judgment as a forensic/judicial event (books opened, works evaluated, verdict rendered by krinō) rather than as the initiation of ongoing conscious torment. The judicial framework of evaluation → verdict → execution governs the structure of every major judgment scene. | E268 (Rev 20:12: books opened, works evaluated, krinō); E273 (Heb 6:2: krima aiōnion = eternal verdict — listed as foundational doctrine); N043 (forensic vocabulary confirmed at Great White Throne); N045 (Jhn 5:29: named after verdict not torment); E270 (kriseōs = judgment/verdict); E279 (Mat 12:37: katakrithēsē = judicial condemnation); E278 (2Co 5:10: bēma = tribunal platform for judicial decisions) | Systematizes the shared forensic vocabulary across seven distinct passages into a pattern claim. The claim that "the judicial framework governs the structure of every major judgment scene" requires the inference step of treating the aggregate pattern as reflecting intentional theological structure — no single verse states this. All components are E/N items. | #5 (systematizing) | Neutral | etc5-14 | — |
| IA026 | The torment vocabulary (G929 basanismos + G928 basanizo, total 18 NT occurrences) is confined entirely to the apocalyptic context of Revelation and is absent from every Pauline epistle, every General Epistle, and every Synoptic Gospel that systematically teaches about the fate of the wicked. The destruction vocabulary (G622 apollumi + G3639 olethros, total 96 NT occurrences) appears throughout the NT — in Pauline didactic teaching, in the Gospels, in the General Epistles — wherever the fate of the wicked is addressed outside the specific Revelation apocalyptic contexts. | E172 (basanismos = 6 occurrences, Revelation only); E181 (basanizo = 12 total, eschatological uses confined to Revelation); E210 (Paul's consistent eschatological noun = olethros, never basanismos); N033 (the two vocabulary sets are lexically distinct); E114, E116, E165, E168, E169, E174, E183, E275 (destruction vocabulary throughout NT didactic teaching) | No single verse states "the torment vocabulary is confined to Revelation and absent from didactic teaching." Systematizes the complete occurrence data for both vocabulary groups into a genre-distribution pattern claim. The inference step is treating the aggregate distribution as evidence for a systematic distinction between the apocalyptic torment vocabulary and the didactic destruction vocabulary. | #5 (systematizing vocabulary data) | Conditionalist | etc5-16 | etc5-17 |
| IA027 | The proportional punishment principle — explicitly taught by Jesus (Luk 12:47-48: many vs. few stripes based on knowledge and responsibility) and embedded in the Ezk 18 proportional accountability framework — extends to eschatological final punishment. If punishment is graduated based on degree of knowledge and responsibility, a doctrine of uniform infinite eternal torment for every unsaved person regardless of degree of guilt is not consistent with the stated proportionality principle. The conditionalist position — that destruction is the outcome, with varying degrees of experience possible before final destruction — is more compatible with proportional punishment than ECT's uniform infinite torment. | E311 (Luk 12:47-48: many/few stripes explicitly graduated — Jesus's own teaching); E293 (Rev 16:6: "worthy" = proportional judgment vocabulary); E290 (Deut 32:4: "his work is perfect" — no excess); Rom 2:6 (render to every man according to his deeds = proportionality principle); the extension to eschatological final punishment is the inference step | No single verse states "the proportionality principle requires annihilation rather than ECT." The extension of the graduated punishment principle (E311, few/many stripes for temporal punishment) to the eschatological final punishment requires the inference step of applying a temporal-punishment proportionality principle to eternal judgment.

| IA028 | The pattern of statements about what God does NOT will/take pleasure in (death/apollumi of the wicked: E297, E106, E107, E302, E303), combined with the pattern of statements about the non-perpetuity of his anger (E300, E301, E298, E299), constitutes a coherent biblical portrait of God's character that is more consistent with annihilation (a finite destruction God does not delight in but executes in judgment) than with ECT (an infinite perpetual torment God actively maintains forever, with anger never relenting). The individual statements are E-tier; the systematic inference from the aggregate pattern is I-A. | E297 (Ezk 33:11: sworn — no pleasure in wicked's death); E106 (Ezk 18:23: no pleasure in death); E107 (Ezk 18:32: no pleasure in death); E302 (2 Pet 3:9: not willing that any should apollumi); E303 (Mat 18:14: not Father's will that little ones apollumi); E300 (Lam 3:33: does not afflict willingly); E301 (Mic 7:18: retaineth not anger forever; delighteth in mercy); E298 (Hos 11:8-9: restrains fierce anger; "I am God not man"); E299 (Isa 57:15-16: will not contend forever; souls would fail) | No single verse states "God's character is more consistent with annihilation than ECT." The claim is a systematic inference from nine independent E-tier statements across six OT books and one NT epistle. Systematizing these into a "more consistent with" conclusion requires treating the aggregate pattern as evidence for what the total character portrait implies. The inference step is criterion #5; the alternative reading (all these statements are compatible with ECT) is disputed. | #5 (systematizing multiple independent E-tier character statements into a pattern claim) | Conditionalist | etc5-17 | — |

| IB001 | The Bible teaches a conscious intermediate state for the righteous — a state of being "with Christ" or "with the Lord" between death and resurrection. | FOR: E038 (absent from body = present with Lord — 2 Cor 5:8); E039 (depart = be with Christ — Phil 1:23); E050 (today with me in paradise — Luk 23:43); E051 (souls under altar cry out — Rev 6:9-11; reclassified Neutral in etc5-10, no longer a FOR-ECT item); E052 (spirits of just men made perfect — Heb 12:23); E123 (Rich Man in Hades conscious — Luk 16:22-25, added etc5-03). AGAINST: E020 (man lies down, rises not — Job 14:12); E017 (dead know not any thing — Ecc 9:5); E013 (thoughts perish that very day — Psa 146:4); E014 (dead do not praise — Psa 115:17); N005 (God alone has immortality); N006 (immortality at resurrection); N009 (death = sleep); E082 (deathless state is post-resurrection — Luk 20:36); E128 (without resurrection, dead in Christ perished — 1 Cor 15:18); E124 (dead lived not until resurrection — Rev 20:5); E129 (righteous dead rest from labours — Rev 14:13); E130 (David dead and buried — Acts 2:29); E131 (soul in hades until resurrection — Acts 2:31); N025 (not living between death and resurrection); N026 (hades = temporary holding state). | No verse explicitly states "there is a conscious intermediate state." Phil 1:23 and 2 Cor 5:8 are interpreted as implying it; state-of-the-dead passages are interpreted as limited in scope. Both sets of E/N items are genuine. | #2 (choosing between possible readings); #5 (systematizing into a doctrine) | ECT | **Moderate — weight AGAINST conscious intermediate state** (shifted from Unresolved in etc5-04). FOR side: E039 (Phil 1:23, Plain), E050 (Luk 23:43, contextually complicated by Acts 2:31 and Jhn 20:17), E038 (Contextually Clear), E123 (Contextually Clear). E051 reclassified Neutral in etc5-10 — no longer a FOR-ECT item; active FOR side retains E038, E039, E050, E052. AGAINST side: 11 Plain items from 8+ independent authors; SIS #4a connections (E128 governs E039 via same author; E131 governs E050 via same Lukan corpus; E124 governs E051 via same Johannine corpus). | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03; etc5-04; etc5-05; etc5-06; etc5-09; etc5-10 |
| IB002 | The "dead know not any thing" language in Ecclesiastes is limited to earthly affairs "under the sun" and does not address the state of the spirit in God's presence. | FOR qualifier: E012 (spirit returns to God — Ecc 12:7); E018 (dead have no more portion in things done "under the sun" — Ecc 9:6); E052 (spirits of just men made perfect); E039 (depart to be with Christ). AGAINST: E017 (dead know not any thing — unqualified in v.5); E013 (Psa 146:4: no qualifier); E014, E015, E016, E022 (multiple independent passages with no qualifier). | Requires importing "under the sun" framework from Ecc's literary structure into v.5, which does not contain it. | #3 (applying literary framework to qualify an absolute statement); #2 | ECT | Moderate — weight AGAINST the qualifier (multiple unqualified independent witnesses from different authors). Hebrew morphological analysis (etc5-04) confirms "under the sun" is grammatically absent from v.5. | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03; etc5-04 |
| IB003 | Human beings consist of three distinct substances: spirit, soul, and body (trichotomy). | FOR: E040 (spirit and soul and body — 1 Th 5:23 three terms); E041 (word divides soul and spirit — Heb 4:12). AGAINST: E058 (soul and spirit as synonymous parallels — Luk 1:46-47); E001, E053 (man became one nephesh — Gen 2:7 two-component formula); N001 (two components, not three). | No verse states "humans have three distinct substances." Requires inferring distinct substances from distinct terms. | #2 (three terms = three substances vs. totality of person); #5 (systematizing into ontological claim) | Neutral | Moderate — weight AGAINST ontological trichotomy | etc5-01 | — |
| IB004 | Human beings consist of two distinct substances: an immaterial soul/spirit and a material body (substance dualism / dichotomy). | FOR: E041 (Heb 4:12 — soul/spirit and body distinguishable); E038 (absent from body = present with Lord — 2 Cor 5:8); E039 (Phil 1:23); E048, E049 (spirit commended to God at death). AGAINST: E001, E053 (man became a nephesh — whole person is the nephesh, not a soul in a body — Gen 2:7); N001 (result, not recipient); E059 (body without spirit = dead, not: spirit continues after body dies). | No verse states "humans consist of two distinct metaphysical substances." Substance dualist reading of Heb 4:12 and 2 Cor 5:8 requires inferring ontological separateness from functional statements. Gen 2:7 works against. | #2 (distinct concepts vs. distinct substances); #5 (systematizing into ontological claim) | Neutral | Unresolved — genuine textual evidence on both sides | etc5-01 | — |
| IB005 | "The spirit returns to God" in Ecc 12:7 means a conscious personal entity (the soul of the person) goes to God in a state of awareness at death. | FOR: E012 (spirit returns to God who gave it — Ecc 12:7); E048, E049 (spirit commended to God — Luk 23:46; Acts 7:59); E039 (depart to be with Christ — Phil 1:23); E052 (spirits of just men made perfect — Heb 12:23). AGAINST: E010, E011 (man and beast share one ruach; all go to dust — Ecc 3:19-20); E095 (Ecc 3:21: Qohelet treats destination of human spirit as open question — "who knoweth?" — added etc5-03); N011 (ruach belongs to God, is his animating breath); E013 (thoughts perish that very day — simultaneous with ruach departure); IA015 (spirit-commendation Acts 7:59 followed immediately by sleep Acts 7:60 — added etc5-04). | "Returns to God" does not specify conscious vs. unconscious state. The same ruach is shared with animals (E010). Ecc 3:21 (same author, same book as Ecc 12:7) treats the human spirit's upward movement as uncertain, weighing against reading 12:7 as a confident assertion of conscious personal survival. | #2 (two possible meanings of "spirit returns to God"); #4b (unverified cross-reference Ecc 12:7 → Phil 1:23) | ECT | Moderate — weight toward "animating life-force returning to source." Strengthened in etc5-03 by E095 (Ecc 3:21) and in etc5-04 by IA015 (Acts 7:59-60: spirit-commendation followed by sleep in same narrative). | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03; etc5-04 |
| IB006 | Luke 16:19-31 (Rich Man and Lazarus) is a literal historical account of the intermediate state, providing factual information about conscious existence in Hades/Abraham's bosom between death and resurrection. | E123 (Rich Man in Hades conscious, in torment; Lazarus in Abraham's bosom; dialogue occurs; "great gulf fixed" — Luk 16:22-25). Text contains dialogue, memory, requests, and responses. FOR literal: E123 (Contextually Clear — conscious activity described in text, but parabolic genre context prevents Plain status); E220 (Lazarus named — genuine anomaly, Neutral). AGAINST literal / FOR parabolic: E224 (Plain — Lukan parabolic practice established for discourse-level unlabeled units: Luk 15:3 covers three unlabeled parables); E225 (Plain — same "certain rich man" formula explicitly labeled parabolē in Luk 12:16 by same author); E223 (Plain — passage's own stated purpose = sufficiency of Moses/Prophets, vv.29-31); E013, E017, E020, E130, E131 (all Plain — state-of-the-dead passages from multiple independent authors); N026 (Contextually Clear — hades = temporary pre-resurrection state); N023 (Conditionalist necessary — dead lack consciousness, multiple independent authors); N038 (Neutral necessary — even on literal reading, the passage describes pre-resurrection hades, not the final post-judgment state). | The text provides the content (conscious activity in Hades) but does not state "this is a literal description." The claim adds assertion of literal historicity to what the text presents as parabolic teaching. Genre classification is the inference step. | #2 (choosing between literal and parabolic reading); #3 (applying genre classification) | ECT | **Moderate — weight toward parabolic/literary genre interpretation (not literal hades description)** (shifted from Unresolved in etc5-09). SIS #4a connections: (1) Luk 12:16 labeled "certain rich man" instance governs Luk 16:19 unlabeled same-formula instance (same author, same Gospel, same vocabulary); (2) Luk 15:3 discourse-level label practice explains unlabeled parabolic units throughout the pericope; (3) Acts 2:31 (same author) establishes hades as pre-resurrection holding state, governing Luk 16:23; (4) Luk 16:29-31 self-interpretation: passage's own stated purpose governs its genre function. NOT STRONG: naming of Lazarus (E220) is genuinely unusual — the only named human in any parable of Jesus — and introduces irreducible uncertainty preventing Strong resolution. | etc5-03 | etc5-04; etc5-05; etc5-09; etc5-15 |
| IB007 | Luke 20:38 ("all live unto him") is a statement about the present conscious state of the dead — the patriarchs are currently alive to God in a conscious intermediate state. | The phrase "all live unto him" (pantes gar auto zosin) is present tense. If this means currently alive to God, the patriarchs are presently conscious. AGAINST: Jesus's argument structure suggests "all live unto him" = guarantee of future resurrection based on God's covenant relationship; the logic is that the resurrection is implied by the divine covenant. Also: E020 (Job 14:12 — lies down, rises not); E017 (dead know nothing — Ecc 9:5); E082 (Luk 20:36: deathless state belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection — same discourse, same chapter). | The present tense zōsin is in a non-didactic argument from scriptural precedent; the phrase could mean present consciousness or resurrection-certainty. Neither reading is demanded by the Greek without contextual judgment. | #2 (choosing between two possible meanings); #3 (applying framework) | ECT | Moderate — weight toward "all live unto him" = resurrection-certainty based on divine covenant, not present conscious existence. The clearer adjacent statement (Luk 20:36 = E082, deathlessness belongs to those who have obtained the resurrection) governs via #4a SIS (same discourse, same chapter). | etc5-03 | etc5-04 |
| IB008 | The ongoing torment language applied to the devil, beast, and false prophet (Rev 20:10) and to beast-worshippers (Rev 14:10-11) applies universally to all persons cast into the lake of fire. | FOR: E149 (Rev 20:10: devil/beast/false prophet tormented "day and night for ever and ever"); E150 (Rev 14:10-11: beast-worshippers tormented with fire; smoke ascending "for ever and ever"). Both use explicit ongoing-torment language with "for ever and ever." AGAINST: Rev 20:15 (humans cast into the lake of fire in the same passage, immediately following, without the torment language); the four "hell" words consistently use destruction vocabulary, not torment (N028, IA016, E026, E142, E143); 2 Th 1:9 uses "destruction" for the wicked's punishment (E116); the specific subjects named in both passages are defined groups (three supernatural entities in 20:10; a tribulation-specific group in 14:10-11). | Rev 20:15 and Rev 14:10-11 both use "cast into" for the general human wicked without adding "tormented day and night for ever and ever." Extending the torment language from specific named entities to all persons in the lake requires inferring beyond the stated subjects. | #2 (choosing between text-specific and universal application); #3 (systematizing into universal claim) | ECT | **Moderate — weight AGAINST universal extension.** E149 and E150 are genuine ECT explicit statements about specific named subjects. Rev 20:15 (same author, same passage, adjacent verse) casts the human wicked into the lake without repeating the torment language. SIS #4a: the adjacent verse governs scope — if the ongoing torment description were universal, the immediately following verse (v.15) would be the natural place to extend it. | etc5-05 | etc5-06; etc5-08; etc5-12; etc5-14; etc5-15; etc5-17 |
| IB009 | The "smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" in Revelation 14:11 is an appropriation of the permanent-desolation imagery of Isaiah 34:10 (smoke of burning Edom ascending forever) — a literary formula for permanent ruin — rather than a literal description of ongoing conscious suffering in perpetuity. | FOR (literary formula / desolation imagery): E182 (Isa 34:10 = OT source text, highest parallel, score 0.401; Edom's burning land is the referent, not conscious persons); E250 (Rev 19:3 = same formula, same author, same book, applied to Babylon which is "found no more at all" — completed destruction); N029 (eternal fire = permanent result, not ongoing process per Jude 1:7 + 2 Pet 2:6); E147 (Sodom eternal fire = ashes); E192 (Isa 34:11-17 = animals in desolation after smoke-for-ever). AGAINST: E150 (Rev 14:10-11: basanizo/basanismos used; smoke connected to "their torment"; text states "no rest day nor night" for the beast-worshipping class — Plain in stating language, Ambiguous as to duration mechanism once Rev 19:3 within-book demonstration is applied). | Both sides have textual support. The OT background (Isa 34:10 = desolation imagery) points toward literary formula; the NT text's use of basanizo (torment) points toward conscious experience; but Rev 19:3 (same formula, same book, completed destruction) demonstrates the formula describes permanent result not ongoing burning. | #2 (choosing between literary formula and literal description); #3 (applying genre/literary-context framework); #4a (SIS: Isa 34:10 = source text; Rev 19:3 = within-book demonstration of the formula's use for completed destruction) | Neutral | **RESOLVED STRONG — weight toward literary formula / permanent-desolation imagery.** (Upgraded from Moderate in etc5-11.) The Rev 19:3 within-book structural parallel (E250) is decisive: the same author uses the identical Greek formula (kapnos + anabainei + eis tous aionas tōn aiōnōn) in Rev 19:3 for Babylon — which Rev 18 describes as destroyed "in one hour" and "found no more at all" (Rev 18:21). This is a #4a SIS connection of the highest caliber (same author, same book, same formula, demonstrably completed destruction). FOR-desolation side: Plain items (E250 Rev 19:3 within-book; N029 eternal fire = ashes; E147 Sodom = ashes) + Contextually Clear items (E182 Isa 34:10 source; E192 Isa 34:11-17 desolation). AGAINST side: E150 is Plain in stating torment/smoke/no-rest language but Ambiguous as to duration mechanism once the within-book demonstration is applied. Strong resolution criteria satisfied: Plain items on FOR side; only Ambiguous items on AGAINST side regarding the specific duration-mechanism question. Qualification: the torment of beast-worshippers (basanizo) is real; the Strong resolution addresses the duration mechanism of the formula, not the reality of the judgment. | etc5-06 | etc5-07; etc5-08; etc5-11; etc5-15; etc5-16; etc5-17 |
| IB010 | "Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord" (2 Th 1:9) means banishment/separation from God's presence — the wicked exist forever in a state of being cut off from God — rather than their complete annihilation as the result of encountering God's destructive presence. | FOR (separation reading, ECT): "apo prosopou" (from the presence) could denote being removed/banished from God's presence — the wicked exist forever in a state of separation from God. AGAINST (source reading, conditionalist): Paul's noun is olethros (destruction/ruin), not a separation word (E116); Psa 68:2 (wicked perish abad at the presence of God = E175, presence = destructive agent); Psa 9:3 (enemies "perish at thy presence" — presence causes destruction, not separation); E152, E155, E158, E160 (non-existence vocabulary throughout the OT destruction cluster). | The reading "banishment from God's presence" is grammatically possible but requires understanding apo prosopou as a prepositional phrase of separation rather than source/agent. It also requires understanding olethros as "condition of separation" rather than its lexical meaning (ruin/destruction). | #1 (adding the concept "ongoing existence in separation" not present in olethros); #2 (choosing between source reading and separation reading of apo prosopou) | ECT | **Moderate — weight AGAINST banishment/separation reading.** The clearer passages (Ps 9:3; Ps 68:2 = E175) use "at/from the presence" as the location/source of destruction, not of banishment. The word Paul chose (olethros = ruin, destruction) most naturally denotes the result of being destroyed rather than the ongoing state of being separated. | etc5-06 | etc5-14 |
| IB011 | The identical grammatical construction of Dan 12:2 (same olam construct chain for both outcomes) means "everlasting contempt" and "everlasting life" have the same type and duration of existence — so if one is age-long/permanent-result, so is the other, and if one is endless, so is the other. | FOR (symmetry argument — same duration for both): E023 (Dan 12:2: both construct chains grammatically identical — לְחַיֵּ֣י עֹולָ֔ם and לְדִרְאֹ֥ון עֹולָֽם; same olam governs both outcomes; BHSA parsing confirmed). AGAINST (referent-nature argument — duration adapts to subject): N034 (duration = nature of subject, established by Hab 3:6: same verse, olam for scattered mountains AND enduring God's ways); E193 (dir'on = H1860, occurs only in Dan 12:2 and Isa 66:24; Isa 66:24 context = corpses/pigrê); E194 (Jer 51:57 olam sleep = shall not wake, qits root = non-ongoing cessation); E185-E186 (40+ KJV renderings of olam, semantic range documented). | The grammatical symmetry is an observable textual fact (E tier). What the symmetry implies about the specific duration is I-B: the symmetry argument and the referent-nature argument both have E/N support. | #2 (choosing between symmetry-governs-duration and referent-nature-governs-duration readings) | Neutral | **Moderate — weight toward referent-nature interpretation.** N034 (Hab 3:6: same word, same verse, demonstrably different durations) is a necessary implication that directly addresses how to read same-word-applied-to-different-referents in the same text. This governs the Dan 12:2 symmetry via #4a SIS (shared vocabulary, same-word observation). The dir'on lexical link (E193) and qits-root connection (E194) corroborate the referent-nature reading for the contempt outcome. The symmetry observation itself remains a legitimate Neutral textual fact. | etc5-07 | etc5-08; etc5-15 |
| IB012 | The identical grammatical construction of Mat 25:46 (same A-ASF form aionion for both outcomes: kolasin aionion and zoen aionion) means that "everlasting punishment" and "eternal life" have the same type and duration of existence — so if one is endless, so is the other, and if one is permanent-result, so is the other. | FOR (symmetry argument — same duration for both): E208 (Mat 25:46: both aionion instances are A-ASF — grammatically identical); E119 (same adjective, both outcomes stated by Jesus in same verse). AGAINST (referent-nature argument): N034 (duration = nature of subject, established by Hab 3:6 — same verse, demonstrably different durations); N035 (aionios inherits olam's subject-dependent quality); N036 (aionios demonstrably backward-pointing in 3 NT uses — cannot be inherently "forward-endless"); E206 (Phm 1:15: aionios for mortal human, bounded duration); E207 (Heb 9:12: aionios for completed once-for-all act, permanent result); IB011 (same structural argument for Dan 12:2 resolved Moderate toward referent-nature); E209 (the noun is kolasis = penal infliction, not basanismos = torment — the nouns differ in mechanism implications). | The grammatical symmetry is an observable textual fact (E208 = E tier). What the symmetry implies about specific duration of the two outcomes is I-B: the symmetry argument and the referent-nature argument both have E/N support. Structurally identical to IB011 (Dan 12:2) applied to the NT. | #2 (choosing between symmetry-governs-duration and referent-nature-governs-duration readings) | Neutral | **Moderate — weight toward referent-nature interpretation.** N034 (Hab 3:6: same word, same verse, demonstrably different durations) directly addresses how to read the same word applied to different referents in the same text, governing Mat 25:46 via #4a SIS. The noun difference (kolasis = penal infliction vs. zoe = life as an inherently ongoing state by definition) corroborates the referent-nature reading: the nouns' own semantic categories differ in their mechanism implications even when the adjective form is identical. IB011 (same structural argument, already resolved Moderate toward referent-nature on identical grounds) corroborates this resolution. The symmetry observation remains a legitimate Neutral textual fact. | etc5-08 | etc5-15 |
| IB013 | Revelation 6:9-11 depicts literally conscious disembodied human spirits in an intermediate state between death and resurrection, actively speaking, receiving garments, and receiving divine communication — providing direct evidence for a conscious intermediate state. | FOR literal conscious intermediate state: [E051 reclassified Neutral] (Rev 6:9-11 depicts souls under the altar crying — acknowledged by both sides as textual description); E247 (Rev 6:10 constructio ad sensum — masculine legontes treats souls grammatically as persons). AGAINST literal / FOR personification/blood-testimony: E231 (Rev 1:1: esēmainō = sign-communication); E232 (Rev 6:8: Death/Hades as horsemen — personification in same chapter); E233 (Rev 16:7: altar speaks — inanimate object attributed speech in same book); N039 (Revelation's genre depicts non-conscious entities speaking); E234 (Gen 4:10: dead Abel's blood cries from the ground); E235 (Heb 11:4: Abel being dead yet speaketh — through sacrifice, not consciousness); E236 (cross-testament tool: Rev 6:10 = top NT parallel for Gen 4:10, score 0.330); E237, E238 (Lev 4:7; 17:11: blood poured at altar base = nephesh/soul = Levitical framework); E239 (sphazō connects martyrs to Lamb's sacrificial death); E240 (Rev 20:4: same vocabulary as Rev 6:9); N040 (same group: Rev 6:9 and Rev 20:4); E241, N041 (Rev 20:5: their "living" = first resurrection — resurrection event, not intermediate state); E242 (anapauō: same word Rev 6:11 and Rev 14:13 for condition of blessed dead); E245, E246 (Jas 5:4; Luke 19:40: crying convention for non-conscious entities); E248 (Ps 79:5,10: living community cries "how long?" for slain servants); E017, E019 (dead know nothing — Ecc 9:5,10); N023 (dead lack consciousness — multiple authors); N025 (dead "not living" between death and resurrection). | Rev 6:9-11 describes souls in apocalyptic vision using imagery from two established OT conventions: blood-at-altar-base (Lev 4:7; 17:11) and blood-crying-for-justice (Gen 4:10). Whether the visionary depiction represents literal conscious disembodied spirits or personified blood-testimony is the inference requiring SIS resolution. | #2 (choosing between literal and personification readings); #3 (applying genre/literary-context framework); #4a (SIS: same book, same author; OT cross-testament parallel verified by tool) | Neutral | **RESOLVED STRONG — weight toward personification/blood-testimony reading (AGAINST literal conscious intermediate state).** Five #4a SIS connections from the same author/book or tool-verified cross-testament: (1) Rev 16:7 (altar speaks — same author/book): inanimate object attributed speech in Revelation's genre governs speech-attribution in Rev 6:9-11; (2) Rev 6:8 (same chapter): Death/Hades as horsemen = personification is the governing literary mode of the same vision sequence; (3) Gen 4:10 / Heb 12:24 (tool-verified top parallel, score 0.330): blood of dead Abel cries = established OT precedent governing Rev 6:10; (4) Rev 20:4-5 (same author/book): same group's "living" explicitly = first resurrection — pre-resurrection state is pre-living; (5) Rev 14:13 (same author/book): anapauō = Spirit's characterization of the blessed dead — governs meaning of identical word in Rev 6:11. FOR-literal side has one Contextually Clear item (visual depiction of activity) and one grammatical observation (constructio ad sensum) — no Plain items. Strong (not Moderate) because the FOR-literal side has no Plain items establishing literal consciousness for these entities against the multiple Plain items on the FOR-personification side. | etc5-10 | — |
| IB014 | The phrase "they have no rest day nor night" (anapausin ouk ekhousin hēmeras kai nyktos, Rev 14:11) describes either (a) ongoing perpetual conscious suffering without any intermission, or (b) the unceasing, all-consuming character of the judgment process that admits no respite until it is complete, consistent with how the identical phrase in Rev 4:8 describes the living creatures' continuous unceasing activity. | FOR ongoing conscious suffering [ECT direction]: E150 (Rev 14:10-11: explicit torment language applied to beast-worshippers; "no rest day nor night" in context of "smoke of their torment" ascending for ever and ever — Plain statement of the language). AGAINST / FOR judgment-process reading: E253 (Rev 4:8: same phrase, same author, same book = continuous worshipful activity — the phrase describes unceasing activity without specifying ongoing conscious suffering); E250 (Rev 19:3: same smoke-for-ever formula for Babylon = completed destruction, not perpetual burning); N029 (eternal fire = permanent result); E258 (same root anapauō appears as "rest from their labours" for the righteous dead in v.13, three verses later — the contrast implies the "no rest" characterizes the nature of the judgment outcome, not necessarily perpetual duration). | E150 explicitly states the torment/no-rest language. The question is whether the phrase inherently specifies ongoing conscious duration or characterizes the unceasing nature of the judgment execution. The identical phrase in Rev 4:8 (same book) describes unceasing worship activity without implying endless conscious suffering — demonstrating that the phrase describes unceasing activity generically, not specifically ongoing suffering. | #2 (choosing between two possible readings of the phrase); #4a (SIS: Rev 4:8 same author/book/phrase governs meaning) | Neutral | **Moderate — weight toward judgment-process/permanent-destruction reading.** The Rev 4:8 SIS connection (same author, same book, identical phrase = continuous worshipful activity not suffering) prevents the phrase from being read as unambiguously specifying perpetual ongoing conscious suffering. Combined with E250 (Rev 19:3 within-book same-formula = completed destruction), the "no rest day nor night" language is best understood as characterizing the irreversible, unceasing nature of the judgment execution rather than necessarily specifying perpetual ongoing conscious experience. | etc5-11 | etc5-12; etc5-15 |

| IB015 | The for-ever-and-ever formula (εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων) at Rev 20:10, applied directly to the active torment verb βασανισθήσονται ("shall be tormented") for three named supernatural entities, carries the same literary-formula / permanent-judgment meaning established by IB009 (STRONG) for the formula applied to ascending smoke nouns (Rev 14:11; Rev 19:3). | FOR (literary formula / permanent-but-not-necessarily-perpetual-conscious): E256 (same formula: 11 times divine/redeemed; 3 times judgment including Babylon's completed destruction); IB009 STRONG (Rev 19:3: same author, same book, identical formula for Babylon = "found no more at all"); N034 (duration contextually determined by referent's nature); IB014 Moderate (day-and-night language not inherently perpetual-suffering). AGAINST (direct-verb application differs from smoke-noun cases): E149 (ECT: explicit future torment verb basanisthesontai directly; three named entities as grammatical subjects); E212 (named supernatural entities are stated to be tormented, not merely whose smoke ascends); E179 (beast's going into apoleia does not clearly specify completed-destruction for the lake-of-fire event; cf. Rev 17:8,11). SIS connections: FOR side — Rev 19:3 (#4a: same author/book/formula, demonstrably completed destruction) governs the formula's capacity to describe permanent judgment. AGAINST side — no within-book parallel where the torment-verb-plus-formula construction describes a demonstrably completed event (the Babylon analogy is for a smoke noun, not a torment verb). | Three named supernatural entities are grammatically stated as the subjects of an active future torment verb modified by the for-ever formula. Whether this direct-verb application carries the same permanent-result meaning as the smoke-ascending cases (IB009), or whether the verb application is more direct evidence of ongoing conscious perpetual experience, requires interpretation. | #2 (choosing between literary-formula/permanent-result and direct-literal ongoing-experience readings of the verb-formula construction); #4a (SIS: Rev 19:3 governs the formula's capacity; no within-book counter-demonstration for verb application) | Neutral | **Moderate — weight toward permanent/irrevocable judgment of specific supernatural entities; IB009's within-book demonstration prevents Strong ECT resolution, but the direct-verb application prevents Strong Conditionalist resolution.** The Moderate weight toward permanent/irrevocable (rather than Strong ECT) is determined by: (1) IB009's undisputed within-book demonstration that the formula can describe completed judgment; (2) the supernatural nature of the three subjects whose mode of existence is not assumed equivalent to mortal humans; (3) N034 (duration adapts to referent's nature). The Moderate weight does not reach Strong in the Conditionalist direction because the torment verb is grammatically more direct than a smoke noun and has no offsetting within-book counter-demonstration. | etc5-12 | etc5-15; etc5-17 |

| IB016 | The fire of Matthew 25:41 ("everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels") involves ongoing torment for human persons cast into it, just as it involves torment for the devil and his angels — the preparation for supernatural entities and the casting of humans into the same fire implies the same experience. | FOR (ECT direction): E149 (Rev 20:10: devil/beast/false prophet tormented day and night for ever and ever in the lake of fire); E118 (Mat 25:41: everlasting fire prepared for devil/angels; humans directed into it at judgment); same fire = same experience for all who enter it. AGAINST: E212 (Rev 20:10's torment formula explicitly applied ONLY to three named supernatural entities; Rev 20:15 casts human wicked into the lake without repeating the torment formula — same author, adjacent verses, same location); IB008 (established Moderate weight AGAINST universal extension of torment language — first appeared etc5-05); E267 (four distinct castings with distinct subjects and distinct vocabulary in Rev 19-20; torment formula applied only in event 2); E214 (fire was prepared FOR the devil and his angels as stated recipients — humans directed there secondarily). | Extension from the fire's designed recipients (supernatural entities) to human persons' experience in it. Requires inference step: same location = same experience for all who enter. The text of Rev 20:15 (same author, adjacent verse) does not apply the torment formula to human persons. | #2 (choosing between same-location = same-experience and same-location does not require same-experience readings); #5 (systematizing from fire design to human experience) | ECT | **Moderate — weight AGAINST universal extension of torment experience to human wicked.** E212 (Plain: same author, adjacent verses, same lake — torment formula applied in v.10 to three entities, withheld in v.15 for human persons) directly addresses the scope question via #4a SIS (same author, same book, proximate verses). The inference that same-location implies same-experience for humans requires adding a concept the adjacent text withholds. IB008 (established etc5-05, same resolution direction) corroborates. | etc5-14 | etc5-15 |

| IB017 | The "resurrection of damnation" (anastasim kriseōs) in John 5:29 includes ongoing eternal conscious suffering as the content of the damnation — krisis encompasses not just the verdict but the execution of eternal torment as the sentence. | FOR (ECT direction): E149 (Rev 20:10: torment for ever for the three entities in the same eschatological destination); E150 (Rev 14:10-11: torment vocabulary for beast-worshippers); the judicial verdict (krisis) leads to execution of the sentence, which ECT identifies as eternal torment — verdict and execution are inseparable. AGAINST: E270 (kriseōs = G2920, N-GSF = judgment/verdict — confirmed by N1904 parsing; NOT basanismos or basanizō); N045 (the resurrection is named after the judicial verdict not basanismos; both sides must acknowledge the lexical fact); G2920 occurrence data (34 NT uses: all = judicial vocabulary, none translate to torment content); structural parallel — "resurrection of life" (zōēs = the substance of the outcome) shows kriseōs names the character/verdict of the outcome, not the content of torment; the same krisis vocabulary appears in Heb 10:27 (fearful expectation of judgment = consumption/devouring, not torment) and Heb 6:2 (eternal judgment = permanent verdict). | Requires reading torment content INTO krisis vocabulary — importing basanismos semantic content into a word that in all 34 NT uses functions as judicial vocabulary. The text names the destination after the verdict (krisis), not after the experience (basanismos). The FOR-ECT evidence (E149, E150) comes from different passages with different subjects. | #1 (adding the concept "ongoing torment" as the content of krisis, not stated by the word); #2 (choosing between krisis = verdict and krisis = verdict-plus-execution-as-torment) | ECT | **Moderate — weight AGAINST reading eternal conscious torment as the content of kriseōs.** The lexical data is unambiguous (E270, N045: kriseōs = G2920 = judicial vocabulary in all 34 NT uses). Reading torment content into kriseōs requires adding semantic content the word does not carry. The FOR-ECT evidence (E149: torment in a different passage for different subjects; E150: different passage, different subjects) does not directly import torment vocabulary into Jhn 5:29. The passages that name the experience with explicit torment words (basanizō, basanismos) are distinguishable from Jhn 5:29 precisely by their vocabulary choice. | etc5-14 | — |

| IB018 | The character of God as revealed in Scripture — his love, justice, holiness, mercy, wrath, and longsuffering — is more consistent with annihilation/destruction as the final fate of the wicked than with eternal conscious torment (ECT). | FOR conditionalist direction: E297 (Ezk 33:11 — God swears by his own life: no pleasure in wicked's death); E106 (Ezk 18:23 — no pleasure in death of wicked); E107 (Ezk 18:32 — no pleasure in death of him that dieth); E302 (2 Pet 3:9 — not willing that any should apollumi); E303 (Mat 18:14 — not Father's will that little ones apollumi); E298 (Hos 11:8-9 — God restrains fierce anger; "I am God not man, the Holy One"); E299 (Isa 57:15-16 — Holy One inhabiting eternity will not contend forever; souls would fail before him); E301 (Mic 7:18 — retaineth not anger forever because he delighteth in mercy); E300 (Lam 3:33 — does not afflict willingly); E311 (Luk 12:47-48 — graduated proportional punishment from Jesus); E310 (Rom 9:22 — longsuffering toward vessels of wrath specifically named as apoleia); N032 (destruction vocabulary = cessation); IA026 (destruction vocabulary throughout didactic NT). FOR ECT direction / AGAINST conditionalist: E306 (Isa 6:3,5 — absolute holiness; seraphim cover faces); E307 (Hab 1:12-13 — purer eyes than to behold evil; cannot look on iniquity); E149 (Rev 20:10 — devil/beast/false prophet tormented day and night for ever); E150 (Rev 14:10-11 — beast-worshippers tormented; smoke ascending for ever); E123 (Luk 16:23-24 — rich man in torment in hades); E277 (Heb 10:31 — fearful to fall into hands of living God); IB015 (for-ever formula on active torment verb for three named supernatural entities). | No verse states "God's character requires annihilation" or "God's character requires ECT." Both claims require the inference step of determining what God's character "demands" or "allows" for the form of final punishment. Competent scholars on both sides cite these same character attributes in support of their positions. The inference step (character attribute → required form of punishment) is the I-B zone. | #2 (choosing between two interpretive frameworks for what character attributes require/allow); #5 (systematizing character evidence into a positional claim about which view is more consistent) | Neutral | **Moderate — weight toward conditionalist character argument.** Step 1 — Nine conditionalist-direction character items (7 Plain + 2 Contextually Clear) vs. two holiness items establishing sin must be addressed (Plain but compatible with either punishment form) plus ECT explicit items for specific named subjects. Step 2 — Clarity: E297, E106, E107, E302, E303, E300, E301 are Plain; E298, E299 are Contextually Clear. E306, E307 are Plain (holiness) but do not specify punishment form. E149 is Plain for three supernatural entities only. Step 3 — Weight: FOR conditionalist: seven Plain items directly address what God does NOT will (using "death" and "apollumi" = conditionalist vocabulary for final fate) and that wrath is not perpetual. FOR ECT: holiness items (Plain) establish sin must be addressed but are equally compatible with complete destruction; torment items (E149 Plain, E150 Contextually Clear) apply to specific named subjects and fail IB008 Moderate extension test. Step 4 — SIS: Plain conditionalist character statements (non-perpetuity of anger, non-desire of apollumi) interpret the ambiguous question (which punishment form does holiness demand?) — holiness is satisfied by complete removal of evil (N032), which is what OT destruction vocabulary consistently describes. Step 5 — Not Strong because: (a) God's holiness (E306, E307) is genuinely weighty; (b) the conditionalist response "complete destruction satisfies holiness" is itself an I-A inference (IA028); (c) ECT entities E149 remain Plain for three supernatural beings. | etc5-17 | — |

| IC001 | The language of "absent from the body, present with the Lord" (2 Cor 5:8) and "depart and be with Christ" (Phil 1:23) describes an instantaneous subjective experience from the dead person's perspective (who experiences no interval in unconscious sleep), not an objectively continuous intermediate conscious state. | 2 Cor 5:8 (E038); Phil 1:23 (E039) — these texts say what they say. | Adds the concept of "subjective time from the dead person's perspective" — a philosophical concept not found in any E/N item. Not derived from Scripture; applied to resolve the tension between E038/E039 and E017-E022. Does not override any E/N statement. | #3 (philosophical framework about subjective time); #1 (adding a concept the text does not state) | Conditionalist | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03; etc5-04 |
| IC002 | The parallel structure of Rev 14:11 (wicked: "no rest day or night") and Rev 14:13 (righteous dead: "rest from their labours") indicates that rest is the definitive characteristic of the dead in the Lord's condition between death and resurrection — in contrast to the wicked's unceasing torment. | Rev 14:11 states those who worship the beast have "no rest day nor night." Rev 14:13 (E129) states the righteous dead receive "rest from their labours." | No single verse states "rest is the intermediate state of the righteous."

Does not contradict any E/N statement. | #3 (applying literary context: parallel structure in adjacent verses); #5 (systematizing two E items) | Conditionalist | etc5-04 | — |
| IC003 | Peter's use of the Greek mythological term tartaroo in 2 Peter 2:4 demonstrates that when a NT writer drew on Greek underworld vocabulary (Tartaros = the place of punishment for Titans in Greek mythology), he applied it in a restricted and modified scope — pre-judgment confinement of fallen angels only, characterized by darkness not fire — without endorsing the broader Greek Tartaros cosmology that included conscious torment of the human dead in an eternal underworld. This restricted use shows that the Greek mythological Tartaros concept and the NT's teaching about the fate of the wicked are not equivalent. | E287 (tartaroo derives from Greek mythological Tartaros); E145 (applied only to fallen angels); E146 (pre-judgment, chains of darkness); and requires knowing what the full Greek Tartaros mythology entailed (external to the biblical text) | The claim that Peter's restricted use "demonstrates" non-endorsement of the broader Greek cosmology requires knowing the content of the broader Greek Tartaros mythology. This external knowledge is not derived from E/N statements alone, making this I-C (compatible external) rather than I-A. The inference does not override any E/N statement. | #3 (applying external framework — knowledge of Greek Tartaros mythology); #1 (adding the concept of the "broader Greek cosmology" not in the biblical text itself) | Conditionalist | etc5-16 | — |

| ID001 | Humans possess an immortal soul that survives death and continues in conscious existence, separate from the body. | Gen 2:7: man BECAME a nephesh (E001, E053) — formation language does not describe indestructible soul. 1 Tim 6:16: God ALONE has immortality (E029, N005). 1 Cor 15:53: mortals must PUT ON immortality at resurrection (E031, N006). Ezk 18:4: the soul that sins shall die (E024, N007). Mat 10:28: God can destroy the soul (E026, N008). | Conflicts with E029/N005 (God alone has immortality), E031/N006 (immortality at resurrection), E024/N007 (soul can die), E026/N008 (God can destroy the soul). Requires redefining "only" (monos) in 1 Tim 6:16, "must put on" in 1 Cor 15:53, and "die" in Ezk 18:4 to qualify their plain meanings. | #1 (adding "inherent/self-existent immortality"); #2 (qualified readings of monos, athanasia, tamut); #3 (Platonic immortality framework) | E029, N005, E031, N006, E024, E026, N007, N008 | ECT | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03 |
| ID002 | The "soul that sins shall die" (Ezk 18:4) refers only to physical death of the body, not the death of any surviving soul. | Ezk 18:4 states nephesh is the grammatical subject of dying (E024). Rev 16:3 states every living psyche died (E028). Lev 21:11 and Num 6:6 use nephesh met for a corpse (E043). Mat 10:28 states God can destroy the soul (E026). | Requires the nephesh that is said to die to be understood as "only the body" despite nephesh being the grammatical subject of the death predicate. Overrides E024 by restricting "death" to a scope the text does not specify. Also conflicts with E028 (every living psyche died) and E043 (nephesh met = dead soul IS the corpse). | #1 (adding restriction "only physical" not in the text); #2 (qualified reading of tamut) | E024, E028, E043, N007 | ECT | etc5-01 | etc5-02; etc5-03 |
| ID003 | The phrase "God alone [monos] has immortality" (1 Tim 6:16) describes God's pre-eminence in immortality, not exclusive possession; redeemed souls participate in a derived immortality. | 1 Tim 6:16 states God "only [monos] hath immortality" (E029, N005). In the same letter (6:12,19): Timothy instructed to "lay hold on eternal life" — implying it is not yet grasped. Rom 2:7 (E030): humans seek immortality. 1 Cor 15:53-54 (E031, E032): mortals must put on immortality at a future event. | Requires monos (alone/only) to mean "pre-eminently" or "uniquely" rather than "exclusively." The same word monos is used in 1 Tim 6:15 for God as "only Potentate" (clearly exclusive). Qualifying it differently in the adjacent verse requires textual justification the text does not provide. The "seeking" of immortality (Rom 2:7) and the future "putting on" (1 Cor 15:53) both confirm that no human presently possesses it. | #2 (choosing a qualified reading of monos against its plain meaning) | E029, N005, E030/N012, E031/N006 | ECT | etc5-02 | etc5-03 |

**Series Coverage:** etc5-01, etc5-02, etc5-03, etc5-04, etc5-05, etc5-06, etc5-07, etc5-08, etc5-09, etc5-10, etc5-11, etc5-12, etc5-13, etc5-14, etc5-15, etc5-16, etc5-17, and etc5-18 (18 of 18 studies — **SERIES COMPLETE**)

**Last Updated:** etc5-18-comprehensive-synthesis

**No new items added in Study 18** — etc5-18 is a synthesis study; no new exegetical research was conducted; all 410 items were carried forward unchanged.

**Reclassification in etc5-18 audit (7 former ECT E-items → Neutral):**

The 7 E-items previously classified as ECT were reclassified to Neutral after applying the methodology's own rules: (1) grammar — what the text's grammar actually states vs. what is assumed; (2) context — what the surrounding passage and same-author writings say; (3) harmony — one explicit statement cannot contradict another; unclear verses must be interpreted by clear.

- **E038 (2 Cor 5:8):** Two infinitives joined by kai (and); no temporal marker states simultaneity. Paul's own context (2 Cor 5:1-4/E037) shows he desires to be "clothed upon" (resurrection body), not "unclothed" (disembodied). Contradicts E013 (thoughts perish at death), E017 (dead know nothing), E029/N005 (God alone has immortality).
- **E039 (Phil 1:23):** Two infinitives joined by kai; Paul places being "ever with the Lord" at the resurrection in 1 Th 4:16-17. From the subjective perspective of the dead, death → next conscious moment = resurrection. Same contradicting E-items as E038.
- **E050 (Luk 23:43):** Greek manuscripts have no punctuation; comma placement is editorial. The ECT reading creates a direct contradiction: Jesus was in the tomb/hades that day (E131: Acts 2:31), not paradise; John 20:17 (post-resurrection): "I am not yet ascended to my Father."
- **E052 (Heb 12:23):** Same author, two chapters earlier (E228: Heb 11:39-40): the OT righteous have "not having received the promises" and "without us should not be made perfect." Reading 12:23 as currently conscious perfected spirits contradicts 11:40.
- **E123 (Luk 16:23-25):** Parabolic context (same "certain rich man" formula as Luk 12:16 = labeled parable). Setting is hades (temporary pre-resurrection state, N026), not the final state. Contradicts E013-E022 (multiple independent witnesses: the dead lack consciousness, knowledge, praise, communication).
- **E149 (Rev 20:10):** Two of three subjects are symbolic kingdom-entities (E179: Rev 17:8, 11 — beast's destiny = apoleia/destruction). Book's genre: esēmainō/signified (E231: Rev 1:1). Same "for ever" formula applied to Babylon = "found no more at all" (E257: Rev 18:21; Rev 19:3).
- **E150 (Rev 14:10-11):** Grammatical subject of "ascendeth" is kapnos/smoke (E211, tool-confirmed nominative); "for ever and ever" modifies smoke's ascending, not persons' consciousness. OT parallel (Isa 34:10) uses identical language for Edom's completed destruction. Subject class is specific (beast-worshippers), not universal.
