| 2026-02-20 | etc-04 | E144-E174, N017-N021, I024-I030 | State of the Dead study "Conscious or Unconscious?" (43 new items: 31 E, 5 N, 7 I). Covers OT death-state passages (8+ authors, 6+ books), death-as-sleep across 7+ authors (Hebrew shakab/yashen/tardemah/radam, Greek koimao/katheudo), alleged conscious intermediate state passages (2 Cor 5:8, Phil 1:23, Luke 23:43, Luke 16:19-31, Rev 6:9-11, 1 Sam 28, Matt 17, 1 Pet 3:18-20), sheol/hades vocabulary (H7585/G86), resurrection as hope. All alleged conscious intermediate state passages fail Tree 3 gates (parabolic/apocalyptic genre, prohibited practice, vision, absent punctuation). Two I-B items (I007, I008) resolved Strong toward Conditionalist reading (confirming etc-01). Updated "Also In" for E008-E012, E017-E023, E026, E039-E045, E049-E056, E073, E078, E081, E111, E123, E140, N004, N006, I007, I008. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-01 | E175-E176, I031 | Pipeline re-run of "What Is Man?" anthropology study. All primary evidence (E001-E056, N001-N007, I001-I008) already registered in etc-01. New items added: E175 (Heb 4:12 -- word of God divides soul and spirit, Neutral), E176 (Rev 22:14 -- conditional right to tree of life, Neutral), I031 (image of God as unique human distinction -- I-A Conditionalist). I-B resolutions confirmed for I007 (Moderate) and I008 (Strong). Confirmed Rev 6:9-11 Neutral classification per etc-04. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-05 | E177-E211, N022-N026, I032-I035 | Four Hell Words study (44 new items: 35 E, 5 N, 4 I). Complete semantic analysis of sheol (~67 OT occurrences), hades (11 NT occurrences), gehenna (12 NT occurrences), tartaroo (1 occurrence). LXX translation patterns (sheol->hades 58/65 instances). Valley of Hinnom OT background (child sacrifice, slaughter, corpse disposal). KJV translation conflation (4 words -> 1 English word "hell"). Hades distinct from lake of fire (cast into it). Isaiah 66:24 corpse-description as interpretive key for Mark 9:43-48. Jesus' gehenna vocabulary is apollumi (destroy), not basanizo (torment). Two I-B items (I032, I033) resolved Strong toward Conditionalist reading via SIS. One I-D item (I035: four words = unified eternal torment) overrides multiple E/N statements. Updated "Also In" for E017, E018, E021, E022, E028, E044, E068, E123, E124, E125, E127, E137, E139, E144, E145, E146, E148, E155, E167, E168, E170, E171, N004, N019, N020, I030. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-06 | E212-E267, N027-N030, I036-I039 | Destruction Vocabulary study (74 new items: 56 new E, 4 new N, 4 new I; plus 10 existing E-items referenced by master ID). Complete lexical analysis of seven destruction words: abad (H6, 184x), shamad (H8045, 90x), kalah (H3615, 206x), shachath (H7843, 147x), apollymi (G622, 92x), apoleia (G684, 20x), olethros (G3639, 4x). LXX translation patterns verified: abad->apollymi 141x, shamad->apollymi 23x, kalah->synteleo 85x, shachath->diaphtheiro 48x. Perish-vs-life contrast pattern documented across 5+ authors. Destruction similes analyzed (10 types). Three I-B items (I037, I038, I039) resolved Strong toward Conditionalist reading: destruction vocabulary means destruction (not metaphorical ruin), "everlasting destruction" means permanent result (not ongoing process), "wailing and gnashing" describes moment of destruction (not eternal state). Updated "Also In" for E028, E075, E087, E088, E090, E095, E126, E148, E202. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-07 | E268-E295, N031-N035, I040-I042 | Olam word study "Does Hebrew Olam Always Mean Eternal?" (36 new items: 28 new E, 5 new N, 3 new I; plus 4 existing E-items with "Also In" updates). Complete semantic analysis of H5769 olam (~432 occurrences) across six usage categories: (A) God/attributes = genuinely eternal; (B) Covenants/institutions = age-lasting, ended; (C) Human/finite subjects = limited (slave's lifetime, Jonah's 3 days, Samuel's life); (D) Past time = "of old/ancient"; (E) Eschatological = context-dependent; (F) Combined forms = intensified. Root meaning "concealed" = time whose endpoint is hidden, not time without endpoint. LXX translates as aion (287x) and aionios (100x) = "age/age-lasting." Two olam promises explicitly revoked (1 Sam 2:30; 13:13). Olam fire/smoke judgments (Edom, Jerusalem) have demonstrably ended. Netsach used to deny God's wrath is perpetual. I040 (I-A): olam/aionios = age-lasting, duration determined by subject. Two I-B items resolved Strong: (I041) olam does not inherently mean eternal in eschatological contexts; (I042) Dan 12:2 symmetry does not require identical duration. Updated "Also In" for E006, E221, E266, E267. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-08 | E296-E318, N036-N040, I043-I045 | Aionios word study "Does Greek Aionios Inherently Mean Eternal?" (46 new items: 23 new E, 5 new N, 1 new I-A, 3 new I-B; plus 13 existing items with "Also In" updates). Complete analysis of all 71 NT occurrences of aionios (G166), 2 occurrences of aidios (G126), ~22 "ages of ages" passages. Past-time uses (Rom 16:25; 2 Tim 1:9; Tit 1:2) prove aionios does not inherently mean "eternal." Aidios vs. aionios distinction in Jude 1:6-7 confirms non-synonymy. LXX chain (olam -> aionios 100x) inherits olam's contextual flexibility. Hebrews pattern: aionios = permanent result of completed act. Three I-B items resolved Strong: (I043) aionios =/= inherently eternal; (I044) Matt 25:46 symmetry does not require identical duration; (I045) "ages of ages" in Revelation echoes OT ended-judgment language. Updated "Also In" for E075, E076, E085, E087, E088, E090, E096, E125, E126, E202, E207, E254, E270. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-09 | E319-E335, N041-N044, I046-I048 | Rich Man and Lazarus genre study (24 new items: 17 new E, 4 new N, 3 new I; plus 14 existing items with "Also In" updates). Dedicated analysis of Luke 16:19-31. Genre determination: parabolic reading supported by 9+ Plain indicators (Lukan "certain rich man" formula pattern across Luke 12:16/16:1/16:19; parabole-labeling convention in 15:3 covering three stories; literary context of five consecutive narratives in Luke 15-16 discourse; stated teaching point vv.29,31 about Moses and the prophets). Literal reading supported by 1 Contextually Clear indicator (Lazarus named -- but name is thematic "God helps," rich man unnamed, Nave's does not list as historical). I-B resolution: Strong toward parabolic reading. Vocabulary analysis: Luke 16 uses basanos (G931) and odunao (G3600, "grieve/sorrow"), not basanizo (G928) or basanismos (G929) from eschatological torment passages. Same-author evidence: Luke also writes Acts 2:29,34 (David dead, not ascended). "Abraham's bosom" (kolpos Abraam) appears only in Luke 16 as a post-mortem location. Updated "Also In" for E011, E017, E018, E019, E021, E022, E041, E042, E043, E155, E162, E168, E171, I025. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-10 | E336-E354, N045-N048, I049-I051 | Souls Under the Altar study (26 new items: 19 new E, 4 new N, 3 new I). Dedicated analysis of Rev 6:9-11 within apocalyptic genre. Tree 3: Gate 1 FAIL (symbolic vision-figure), Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic genre). Classified Neutral. Nave's VISION classification confirmed. Rev 1:1 sēmainō (communicated by signs). Abel's blood parallel (Gen 4:10; Heb 11:4; 12:24) as forensic personification precedent. Nephesh-blood-altar framework: psychas under altar = blood-life at altar base (Lev 4:7,18,25,30; 17:11). Sphazō (G4969) chain links Lamb (Rev 5:6,9,12), martyrs (Rev 6:9; 18:24), Abel (1 Jn 3:12). Anapauō (G373) link: Rev 6:11 = Rev 14:13 (martyrs' rest = blessed dead's rest). Rev 20:4-5 same group (psychas, martyria, logos tou Theou) "lived" at first resurrection. Altar speaks (Rev 16:7). Death/Hades personified as horsemen (Rev 6:8). Vindication arc: Rev 6:10 (cry) -> Rev 19:2 (fulfilled). Two I-A Cond. (blood-crying motif; rest = unconscious sleep). One I-C ECT-direction (white robes = conscious reward). Updated "Also In" for E011, E014, E016, E017, E018, E019, E021, E041, E042, E056, E154, E155, E156, E171, E335, I026, N004. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-11 | E355-E374, N049-N053, I052-I055 | "Smoke Ascending Forever" study (44 items: 20 new E, 5 new N, 4 new I; plus 23 existing items with "Also In" updates). Dedicated analysis of Rev 14:9-11 and 19:3 with OT source imagery. Isa 34:9-17 analyzed as primary OT source: identical "smoke ascending for ever" and "not quenched night nor day" formula, followed by animals dwelling in desolated ruins (demonstrating formula = permanent desolation, not ongoing combustion). Gen 19:24-28 as foundational fire-and-brimstone type (destruction, not torment). Mal 4:1-3 (burn up, ashes). Basanismos (G929) distribution: 6 occurrences all in Revelation; 3 of 6 describe Babylon's completed destruction. Anapausis (G372) in Rev 4:8 demonstrates "rest not day and night" = continuous activity during execution. Rev 20:9 uses "devoured" for humans vs. "tormented" for devil/beast/false prophet (symbolic). Tree 3 applied to Rev 14:10-11: Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic), reclassified Neutral. One I-B item (I052) resolved Strong: 15+ Plain items govern 1 Ambiguous. Updated "Also In" for E124, E125, E154, E202, E204, E205, E206, E217, E245, E246, E248, E254, E265, E266, E282, E293, E314, E316, E349, E350, N035, N039, I045. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-12 | E375-E389, N054-N055, I056-I058 | "Tormented Forever" study (38 items: 15 new E, 2 new N, 3 new I; plus 17 existing items with "Also In" updates). Dedicated analysis of Rev 20:10 subject identification, basanizo semantic range, and vocabulary differentiation. Three named subjects: devil (non-human), beast (symbolic: 7 heads, 10 horns, "was, and is not"), false prophet (symbolic: second beast of Rev 13). Tree 3 Gate 1 FAIL (all three non-human/symbolic). Gate 3 FAIL (apocalyptic vision). The "tormented for ever and ever" formula appears once in Scripture (Rev 20:10), applied only to these three entities. Human armies are "devoured" (v.9). Humans entering the lake = "second death" (vv.14-15; 21:8). No epistle, Gospel, or OT passage applies basanizo/basanismos to generic human wicked. Basanizo: 7/12 non-judgment; all 5 judgment uses in apocalyptic/demonic framework. One I-B item (I056) resolved Strong: 10+ Plain items govern 2 Ambiguous. I-C confirmed (I054): extension to humans not stated in text. Updated "Also In" for E124, E125, E204, E205, E206, E207, E254, E314, E316, E349, E350, E360, E361, E362, E371, N053, I054. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-13 | E390-E403, N056-N058, I059-I062 | "Lake of Fire / Second Death" study (32 items: 14 new E, 3 new N, 4 new I; plus 11 existing items with "Also In" updates). Rev 20:14 identification: "the lake of fire IS the second death" -- predicate nominative using thanatos, not basanizo. The text's own name for what the lake does to its subjects is "death" -- specifically, a second death. Four "second death" occurrences: Rev 2:11 (overcomers not hurt), Rev 20:6 (no power over first resurrection), Rev 20:14 (definitional identification), Rev 21:8 (definitional identification for human wicked). "Lake of fire" unique to Revelation (5 occurrences). G3041 (limne): 10 NT uses (5 literal, 5 lake of fire). Death/hades cast into lake = destruction of death itself, paralleling 1 Cor 15:26, Isa 25:8, Hos 13:14, 2 Tim 1:10, resulting in Rev 21:4 "no more death." Rom 6:23 "wages of sin is death" (thanatos) = same word as "second death." No torment formula for humans at the lake. I-B item (I059) resolved Strong: 9+ Plain items govern 2 Ambiguous. Updated "Also In" for E065, E072, E124, E125, E204, E254, E371, E377, E378, E384, E389. |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-14 | E404-E419, N059-N061, I063-I070 | "Judgment Passages" study (30 new items: 16 new E, 3 new N, 8 new I; plus existing items with "Also In" updates). Analyzed 8 major judgment passages: Matt 25:31-46, Dan 12:2, John 5:28-29, 2 Thess 1:7-9, Heb 10:26-31, Rom 2:5-16, Rev 20:11-15, Matt 7:21-23. Key findings: kolasis (punishment, not torment) in Matt 25:46; dera'on (contempt = onlookers' reaction) in Dan 12:2 linked to Isa 66:24 peger; olethros aionios (everlasting destruction) in 2 Thess 1:9; krisis (judgment process) not torment description; none of 8 passages uses basanizo for human wicked; 4 of 8 use explicit destruction/death vocabulary. Four I-B items resolved Strong. One I-D (I068: redefining olethros). |
| 2026-02-20 | etc-15 | E420-E422, I071-I080 | "ECT Strongest Case" study (13 new items: 3 new E, 10 new I; plus 28 existing E-items cited with "Also In" updates). Evaluated 8 passages identified by ECT scholars (Peterson, Burk, Morgan) as their strongest biblical case. Web research supplemented standard tools. ECT arguments steelmanned from scholarly sources before methodology applied. Result: 0 ECT E-items, 0 ECT N-items. All 12 ECT items classify as inferences: 4 I-B (all resolved Strong), 7 I-C, 1 I-D. ECT case rests entirely at inference level. 5 Conditionalist I-A items systematize text-derived evidence. Updated "Also In" for E090, E125, E126, E127, E155, E156, E192, E204, E207, E254, E265, E266, E267, E288, E302, E303, E316, E328, E344, E361, E378, E382, E383, E384, E406, E410, E418. |
