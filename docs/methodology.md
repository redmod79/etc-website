# Investigative Methodology

*This methodology governed ALL 18 studies in this series. Every study followed these rules without exception.*

## Investigative Principles

- **Investigator, not advocate.** The job is to report what the evidence says.
- **Gather evidence from ALL sides.** If a passage is cited by ECT proponents, examine it. If a passage is cited by conditionalists, examine it.
- **Do NOT assume the conclusion** before examining the evidence.
- **Do NOT state opinions.** State what the text says. No editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," or "non-intuitive reading."
- **Present findings as:** "The text says X" (explicit). "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- **Never use** "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- **The conclusion emerges FROM the evidence**, not imposed ON it.

## Evidence Classification

Every study classifies its findings into tiers. The tiers are **Explicit**, **Necessary Implication**, and **Inference** (with four inference subtypes: I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D).

**The classification is about what THE BIBLE says, not what individual verses say in isolation:**

- **Explicit:** "The Bible says X" -- you can point to a verse that says X.
- **Necessary Implication:** "The Bible implies X" -- you can point to verses that, when combined, force X with no alternative.
- **Inferred:** "Someone claims the Bible teaches X" -- but no verse says X and no combination of verses forces X. Something must be added that the text does not contain. Inferences are further classified into four types (I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D) based on source and direction.

**Evidence Hierarchy:** E > N > I-A > I-B (resolved by SIS) > I-C > I-D

**CRITICAL RULE: Inferences cannot block explicit statements or necessary implications.** If explicit texts and necessary implications establish X, the existence of passages that *could be inferred* to teach not-X does not prevent X from being a necessary implication. The passages cited against X must be evaluated on their own terms -- if reading them as contradicting X requires adding a concept, choosing between readings, applying an external framework, or systematizing, then that reading is itself an inference and cannot override what the explicit texts state.

### 1. Explicit Statements Table

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | [What the text directly says -- a quote or close paraphrase] | [Book Chapter:Verse] |

Rules for explicit statements:

- The text must directly say this. Quote or closely paraphrase the actual words of Scripture.
- One explicit statement per verse or closely related verse cluster.
- Include statements from ALL sides of the debate.
- A paraphrase of a single verse in different words is still explicit. "The dead know not any thing" = "The dead lack knowledge" -- explicit (same verse, same meaning).
- **THE MEANING OF WORDS IS EXPLICIT.** If a single verse uses a word, what that word means is part of the explicit statement. "Became a living soul" directly means "is a living soul." "Shall die" means the subject dies. These are not separate conclusions -- they are what the verse says.

### 2. Necessary Implications Table

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | [What unavoidably follows from explicit statements] | [Which E# statement(s)] | [Why no reader could deny this conclusion from those statements] |

Rules for necessary implications:

- A necessary implication follows unavoidably from one or more explicit statements.
- **No additional concept, framework, or interpretation is required** -- only understanding what the words mean.
- **Every reader, regardless of theological position, must agree this follows.** If a reasonable reader could disagree, it is an inference, not a necessary implication.
- Include necessary implications from ALL sides of the debate.

**What belongs here:**

- **The logical entailment of explicit words.** If the text says God "only" has immortality (E), then "no one else has immortality" is a necessary implication -- it is what "only" means stated as a conclusion.
- **Combinations of explicit statements that yield an unavoidable conclusion.** If E says "breath departs, thoughts perish" and E says "the dead know nothing," then "the spirit returns without consciousness" follows necessarily.
- **Observable patterns stated as conclusions.** If term X is applied to humans and animals (per E statements) and term Y is applied only to humans (per E statements), then "Y, not X, distinguishes humans from animals" is a necessary implication.
- **Direct entailments.** If two explicit facts together produce a conclusion without any additional reasoning, that conclusion is a necessary implication.

**Test:** Could a plain reader reach this conclusion from the cited explicit statements without importing any theological framework? Would EVERY reader, from ANY theological tradition, agree this follows? If yes -- necessary implication. If no -- inference.

### 3. Inferences Table (4-Type Taxonomy)

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | [The claim about what the Bible teaches] | [I-A/I-B/I-C/I-D] | [What the relevant verses actually say] | [What must be added beyond what the text contains] | [Which criterion/criteria apply] |

#### The 4-Type Inference Taxonomy

Two dimensions create a 2x2 matrix:

|  | Aligns with E/N | Conflicts with E/N |
|--|--|--|
| **Derived from E/N** | **I-A** (Evidence-Extending) | **I-B** (Competing-Evidence) |
| **Not derived from E/N** | **I-C** (Compatible External) | **I-D** (Counter-Evidence External) |

**I-A (Evidence-Extending):** Uses ONLY vocabulary and concepts found in E/N statements. Only an inference because it systematizes multiple E/N items into a broader claim. Strongest inference type.

**I-B (Competing-Evidence):** Some E/N statements support it, but other E/N statements appear to contradict it. Genuine textual tension where both sides can cite Scripture. Resolved by the Scripture-Interprets-Scripture (SIS) protocol.

**I-C (Compatible External):** Reasoning from outside the text (theological tradition, philosophical framework, historical context) that does not contradict any E/N statements. Supplemental only -- adds information the text does not contain but does not override anything the text says.

**I-D (Counter-Evidence External):** External concepts that require overriding, redefining, or qualifying E/N statements to be maintained. Weakest inference type -- requires the text to mean something other than what it says.

#### Mechanical Tests for Classification

**Source test** (derived vs. external): Strip away the systematization. Are ALL remaining components found in the E/N tables? YES = text-derived (I-A or I-B). NO = external (I-C or I-D).

**Direction test** (aligns vs. conflicts): Does the claim require ANY E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value? YES = conflicts (I-B or I-D). NO = aligns/compatible (I-A or I-C).

**Consistency checks:**

- I-A should only require criterion #5 (systematizing) and optionally #4a (SIS). If it requires #1, #2, or #3, it is misclassified.
- Every I-B must have E/N items on BOTH sides. If only one side has E/N support, it is I-A or I-D.
- Every I-D must override at least one E/N statement. If it overrides nothing, it is I-C.

#### Rules for inferences:

- An inference is a claim about what the Bible teaches that **no verse explicitly states** and **no combination of verses necessarily implies.** Something must be added beyond what the text contains.
- State each inference as a Bible-wide claim ("The Bible teaches X"), not as a verse-specific interpretation ("Verse Y means Z"). Then show why no verse says it and no combination forces it.
- Include inferences from ALL sides (both ECT and conditionalist, both holistic and dualistic, etc.)
- Identify what reasoning step is required that the text itself does not state

**An inference MUST require at least one of these:**

1. **Adding a concept the text doesn't state** -- e.g., "self-existent immortality" when the text just says "immortality"
2. **Choosing between two possible readings** -- e.g., interpreting "nephesh departing" as a conscious entity departing vs. life departing
3. **Applying an external framework** -- e.g., "under the sun" limitation on Ecclesiastes statements
4. **Cross-referencing (split into 4a and 4b -- see SIS section below)**
5. **Systematizing into a doctrine** -- e.g., combining multiple texts into a comprehensive theological position

## Scripture-Interprets-Scripture (SIS) Principle

Standard hermeneutics holds that clear passages interpret unclear ones. This study series formally incorporates this principle:

**Criterion #4 splits into two:**

- **#4a** (SIS with verified textual connection) -- NOT an inference trigger. When a clear passage interprets an unclear one, and the connection is verified (shared vocabulary, OT quotation, tool-verified parallel score, or the text itself establishes the connection), this is standard hermeneutics, not an inference.
- **#4b** (cross-referencing without verified textual connection) -- IS an inference trigger. The reader must supply the connection between passages. The link depends on the interpreter's judgment, not on the text itself.

### I-B Resolution Protocol

When an inference has competing textual support (I-B), this 5-step process is applied:

**Step 1: Identify tension.** List E/N items FOR and AGAINST the claim.

**Step 2: Assess clarity** of each E/N item on a 3-level scale:

- **Plain**: Directly addresses the topic using relevant vocabulary; no interpretation needed
- **Contextually Clear**: Addresses the topic but requires genre/audience/context awareness
- **Ambiguous**: Could plausibly be read either way

**Step 3: Count and weigh.** Plain statements outweigh Ambiguous ones (not a mere vote count). The weight is determined by clarity level, not just quantity.

**Step 4: Apply SIS.** Plain statements determine the reading of Ambiguous ones. The clear interprets the unclear.

**Step 5: State resolution.** One of:

- **Strong** -- Plain statements on one side with only Ambiguous statements on the other
- **Moderate** -- Mix of Plain and Contextually Clear on the dominant side
- **Unresolved** -- Substantial Plain/Contextually Clear statements on both sides

**Clarity criteria** (what makes a passage "clearer"):

1. **Directness of vocabulary** -- actual words vs. figurative language
2. **Genre** -- didactic > apocalyptic > parabolic
3. **Scope** -- universal statement > specific situation
4. **Frequency** -- repeated across authors/testaments > single occurrence
5. **Self-interpretation** -- text explains its own meaning = maximally clear

### 4. Verification Phase

After completing all tables, a verification check is run:

**Step A: Verify explicit statements** -- Does each E-statement directly quote or closely paraphrase actual verse text?

**Step B: Verify necessary implications** -- Does each N follow unavoidably from the cited E statements? Could ANY reader deny this conclusion while accepting the explicit statements?

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test)** -- Strip away the systematization. Are ALL remaining components found in the E/N tables? YES = text-derived (I-A or I-B). NO = external (I-C or I-D).

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test)** -- Does the claim require ANY E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value? YES = conflicts (I-B or I-D). NO = aligns/compatible (I-A or I-C).

**Step E: Run consistency checks** -- Every I-A uses only criterion #5. Every I-B has E/N on BOTH sides. Every I-D overrides at least one E/N statement.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections** -- Every #4a connection is documented with shared vocabulary, OT quotation, or tool-verified parallel. Every #4b is properly treated as an inference trigger.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- Do NOT classify the plain meaning of words as inference. "Only" means only. "Became" means is. "Know not any thing" means lack knowledge.
- Do NOT classify observable textual patterns as inference. If Scripture uses term X for animals and humans, that's a fact you can observe.
- Do NOT classify unavoidable combinations as inference. If explicit statements A + B together yield C with no alternative, C is a necessary implication.
- The COUNTER-CLAIM to an explicit statement or necessary implication is often the real inference. If the text says "the dead know not any thing," the necessary implication is "the dead lack awareness." The inference is "these texts are limited to an earthly perspective" (applies a qualifier the text doesn't state).

### 5. Tally Summary

Each study includes:

```
- Explicit statements: [count]
- Necessary implications: [count]
- Inferences: [count]
  - I-A (Evidence-Extending): [count]
  - I-B (Competing-Evidence): [count] ([N] resolved, [M] unresolved)
  - I-C (Compatible External): [count]
  - I-D (Counter-Evidence External): [count]
```

### 6. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**
- [List -- draw from both Explicit and Necessary Implication tables]

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**
- [List of things neither side can claim the text directly says or necessarily implies -- including things commonly assumed by BOTH sides]

## Critical Rules Governing the Hierarchy

1. **E > N > I-A > I-B > I-C > I-D.** Higher-tier evidence governs the interpretation of lower-tier claims. An I-D claim cannot override an E statement.

2. **Inferences cannot block explicit statements or necessary implications.** If explicit texts and necessary implications establish X, the existence of passages that *could be inferred* to teach not-X does not prevent X from being established.

3. **I-A inferences are the strongest inferences** because they use only the text's own vocabulary and concepts. They are inferences only because they systematize.

4. **I-B inferences require the SIS protocol.** Both sides have textual support. The resolution must be documented. Plain passages interpret ambiguous ones.

5. **I-D inferences bear the heaviest burden.** They require overriding what the text says with concepts the text does not contain. They are valid only if the text itself provides reason to read against its surface meaning.

6. **SIS connections (#4a) are not inference triggers.** Using clear passages to interpret unclear ones -- when the connection is verified -- is standard hermeneutics. Only unverified cross-references (#4b) trigger inference classification.

## Conclusion Tone

Every study's conclusion:

- Presents the classification results as data
- States what the evidence tiers contain
- Does NOT use hedging language like "this doesn't prove X" or "this doesn't disprove Y"
- Does NOT editorialize about what the results mean for either position
- Lets the numbers and classifications speak for themselves

## No Editorial Opinion

- Do NOT characterize passages as being "in tension" with each other -- simply state what each passage says
- Do NOT call any argument "the strongest" or "the weakest" -- present the arguments and the evidence
- Do NOT use "genuinely ambiguous" -- state the possible readings and note which the text specifies or does not specify
- Do NOT say something "requires sustained effort to maintain" -- state the reasoning required and let the reader assess
