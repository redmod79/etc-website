# Investigative Methodology

*This methodology governed ALL 18 studies in this series. Every study followed these rules without exception.*

---

## Investigative Principles

- **Investigator, not advocate.** The job is to report what the evidence says.
- **Gather evidence from ALL sides.** If a passage is cited by ECT proponents, examine it. If a passage is cited by conditionalists, examine it.
- **Do NOT assume the conclusion** before examining the evidence.
- **Do NOT state opinions.** State what the text says. No editorial characterizations like "genuine tension," "strongest argument," "most significant challenge," or "non-intuitive reading."
- **Present findings as:** "The text says X" (explicit). "From this, Y interpretation infers Z" and "W interpretation infers V" (inferred).
- **Never use** "irrefutable," "obviously," or "clearly proves." Use "the text states," "this is consistent with."
- **The conclusion emerges FROM the evidence**, not imposed ON it.

---

## Evidence Classification

Every study classifies its findings into tiers. The tiers are **Explicit**, **Necessary Implication**, and **Inference** (with four inference subtypes: I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D).

**The classification is about what THE BIBLE says, not what individual verses say in isolation:**

- **Explicit:** "The Bible says X" -- you can point to a verse that says X.
- **Necessary Implication:** "The Bible implies X" -- you can point to verses that, when combined, force X with no alternative.
- **Inferred:** "Someone claims the Bible teaches X" -- but no verse says X and no combination of verses forces X. Something must be added that the text does not contain. Inferences are further classified into four types (I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D) based on source and direction.

**Evidence Hierarchy:** E > N > I-A > I-B (resolved by SIS) > I-C > I-D

**CRITICAL RULE: Inferences cannot block explicit statements or necessary implications.** If explicit texts and necessary implications establish X, the existence of passages that *could be inferred* to teach not-X does not prevent X from being a necessary implication. The passages cited against X must be evaluated on their own terms -- if reading them as contradicting X requires adding a concept, choosing between readings, applying an external framework, or systematizing, then that reading is itself an inference and cannot override what the explicit texts state.

---

## 1. Explicit Statements

### Table Format

| # | Explicit Statement | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | [What the text directly says -- a quote or close paraphrase] | [Book Chapter:Verse] |

### Rules

- The text must directly say this. Quote or closely paraphrase the actual words of Scripture.
- One explicit statement per verse or closely related verse cluster.
- Include statements from ALL sides of the debate.
- A paraphrase of a single verse in different words is still explicit. "The dead know not any thing" = "The dead lack knowledge" -- explicit (same verse, same meaning).
- **THE MEANING OF WORDS IS EXPLICIT.** If a single verse uses a word, what that word means is part of the explicit statement. "Became a living soul" directly means "is a living soul." "Shall die" means the subject dies. These are not separate conclusions -- they are what the verse says.

### E vs. I Distinction

**E tier** = what the text directly states (what both sides must acknowledge as textual fact).
**I tier** = what a position interprets or infers from that text.

Examples:

- "Jesus wept" (John 11:35) → **E** (what the text says)
- "Therefore Jesus had genuine human emotions" → **I-A** (systematizes, derived from E)
- "The same word (aionios) modifies 'life' in John 3:16 and 'fire' in Matt 18:8" → **E** (grammatical fact)
- "Therefore both involve the same duration" → **I-B** (requires interpreting what the adjective means)

**The test:** Could both ECT and conditionalist readers accept this as a factual observation about what the text says, even while disagreeing about what it means? If yes → E or N. If no → only then classify by position.

---

## 2. Necessary Implications

### Table Format

| # | Necessary Implication | Based on | Why it is unavoidable |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | [What unavoidably follows from explicit statements] | [Which E# statement(s)] | [Why no reader could deny this conclusion from those statements] |

### Rules

- A necessary implication follows unavoidably from one or more explicit statements.
- **No additional concept, framework, or interpretation is required** -- only understanding what the words mean.
- **Every reader, regardless of theological position, must agree this follows.** If a reasonable reader could disagree, it is an inference, not a necessary implication.
- Include necessary implications from ALL sides of the debate.

**What belongs here:**

- **The logical entailment of explicit words.** If the text says God "only" has immortality (E), then "no one else has immortality" is a necessary implication -- it is what "only" means stated as a conclusion.
- **Combinations of explicit statements that yield an unavoidable conclusion.** If E says "breath departs, thoughts perish" and E says "the dead know nothing," then "the spirit returns without consciousness" follows necessarily.
- **Observable patterns stated as conclusions.** If term X is applied to humans and animals (per E statements) and term Y is applied only to humans (per E statements), then "Y, not X, distinguishes humans from animals" is a necessary implication.
- **Direct entailments.** If two explicit facts together produce a conclusion without any additional reasoning, that conclusion is a necessary implication.

**Test:** Could a plain reader reach this conclusion from the cited explicit statements without importing any theological framework? Would EVERY reader, from ANY theological tradition, agree this follows? If yes -- necessary implication. If no -- inference.

### The N-Tier Stricter Test

Three questions must ALL be answered YES before an item is classified N:

1. **Universal agreement:** Would a scholar from the *opposite* theological position (ECT if you're conditionalist, conditionalist if you're ECT) necessarily agree this follows from the cited E statements? If NO → it's an inference.
2. **No interpretation required:** Does this require choosing between possible meanings, or is it the only possible meaning? If it requires choosing → it's an inference (I-B).
3. **Zero added concepts:** Does this add ANY concept, framework, or connection not present in the cited E statements themselves? If YES → it's an inference.

**If an N item requires defending it or explaining why someone should accept it, it's probably an inference.**

**Common N-tier misclassifications to avoid:**

❌ "Since the same adjective modifies both outcomes, both have the same duration" → **Wrong** (requires interpreting what the adjective means -- that's criterion #2, making it I-B)
✓ "The same adjective is used for both outcomes" → **Correct** (observable grammatical fact)

❌ "Since text says X to subjects A/B/C, and D shares their destination, D also experiences X" → **Wrong** (requires inferring same destination = same experience -- that's I-B)
✓ "The text says X to A, B, and C. The text says D goes to the same destination." → **Correct** (two separate observable statements)

---

## 3. Inferences

### Table Format

| # | Claim | Type | What the Bible actually says | Why this is an inference | Criteria |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|----------|
| I1 | [The claim about what the Bible teaches] | [I-A/I-B/I-C/I-D] | [What the relevant verses actually say -- cite E#/N# AND include actual verse references] | [What must be added beyond what the text contains] | [Which criterion/criteria apply] |

### The 4-Type Inference Taxonomy

Two dimensions create a 2×2 matrix:

|  | Aligns with E/N | Conflicts with E/N |
|--|--|--|
| **Derived from E/N** | **I-A** (Evidence-Extending) | **I-B** (Competing-Evidence) |
| **Not derived from E/N** | **I-C** (Compatible External) | **I-D** (Counter-Evidence External) |

**I-A (Evidence-Extending):** Uses ONLY vocabulary and concepts found in E/N statements. Only an inference because it systematizes multiple E/N items into a broader claim. Strongest inference type.

**I-B (Competing-Evidence):** Some E/N statements support it, but other E/N statements appear to contradict it. Genuine textual tension where both sides can cite Scripture. Resolved by the Scripture-Interprets-Scripture (SIS) protocol.

**I-C (Compatible External):** Reasoning from outside the text (theological tradition, philosophical framework, historical context) that does not contradict any E/N statements. Supplemental only -- adds information the text does not contain but does not override anything the text says.

**I-D (Counter-Evidence External):** External concepts that require overriding, redefining, or qualifying E/N statements to be maintained. Weakest inference type -- requires the text to mean something other than what it says.

### Mechanical Tests

**Source test** (derived vs. external): Strip away the systematization. Are ALL remaining components found in the E/N tables? YES = text-derived (I-A or I-B). NO = external (I-C or I-D).

**Direction test** (aligns vs. conflicts): Does the claim require ANY E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value? YES = conflicts (I-B or I-D). NO = aligns/compatible (I-A or I-C).

**Consistency checks:**

- I-A should only require criterion #5 (systematizing) and optionally #4a (SIS). If it requires #1, #2, or #3, it is misclassified.
- Every I-B must have E/N items on BOTH sides. If only one side has E/N support, it is I-A or I-D.
- Every I-D must override at least one E/N statement. If it overrides nothing, it is I-C.

### Rules for Inferences

- An inference is a claim about what the Bible teaches that **no verse explicitly states** and **no combination of verses necessarily implies.** Something must be added beyond what the text contains.
- State each inference as a Bible-wide claim ("The Bible teaches X"), not as a verse-specific interpretation ("Verse Y means Z"). Then show why no verse says it and no combination forces it.
- **Always include the actual verse references and what they say** in the "What the Bible actually says" column -- the reader should see the biblical evidence without cross-referencing.
- Include inferences from ALL sides (both ECT and conditionalist, both holistic and dualistic, etc.)

**An inference MUST require at least one of these:**

1. **Adding a concept the text doesn't state** -- e.g., "self-existent immortality" when the text just says "immortality"
2. **Choosing between two possible readings** -- e.g., interpreting "nephesh departing" as a conscious entity departing vs. life departing
3. **Applying an external framework** -- e.g., "under the sun" limitation on Ecclesiastes statements
4. **Cross-referencing (split into 4a and 4b -- see SIS section below)**
5. **Systematizing into a doctrine** -- e.g., combining multiple texts into a comprehensive theological position

---

## 4. Positional Classification

Evidence items receive a positional direction (Conditionalist, ECT, or Neutral) **only when one side must deny the textual observation.** Factual observations both sides must accept -- grammatical facts, statistical data, genre identifications, subject identifications -- are Neutral regardless of which side cites them.

### The Key Question

Can both ECT and conditionalist readers accept this as a factual observation about what the text says, even while disagreeing about what it means? If yes → Neutral. If no (one side must deny it) → classify by position.

### Examples of Neutral Items (Not Positional)

- "Rev 20:10 describes three subjects: devil, beast, false prophet"
- "The same adjective (aionios) modifies punishment and life in Matt 25:46"
- "Paul expresses preference to be absent from body, present with Lord"
- "Rich Man and Lazarus contains dialogue about Abraham's bosom and hades"

### Examples of Positional Items

- Conditionalist: "The soul that sins shall die" (Ezek 18:4), "God can destroy soul and body" (Matt 10:28), "The dead know nothing" (Ecc 9:5)
- ECT: "Tormented with fire and brimstone... smoke of their torment ascends forever" (Rev 14:10--11)

### The Four Validation Gates (E and N Items)

Before an E or N item receives a positional classification, it must pass four gates. A failure does not automatically mean Neutral -- the corrected observation is re-entered into the vocabulary scan and may yield a classification in the opposite direction.

**Gate 1 -- Subject Gate.** Is the grammatical subject a literal human being? Automatic fail if the subject is:

- A symbolic entity (a figure in an apocalyptic vision or heavenly scene)
- An allegorical character in a parable (a narrative figure used to illustrate a point)
- A nation, city, or people used as a prophetic type or figure
- A non-human spirit being

**Gate 2 -- Grammar Gate.** Does the original-language grammar unambiguously support the proposed positional reading? Automatic fail if:

- Reading depends on punctuation absent from the original (Greek has no commas -- comma placement is editorial, not textual)
- A connective particle that means "and" is treated as "as/even as" (simultaneity assumed from a word that expresses sequence)
- A modifier attaches grammatically to a different noun than the reading requires
- A temporal or durational word could grammatically attach to a different clause

**Gate 3 -- Genre Gate.** Is the passage didactic prose? Automatic fail if the passage is:

- A parable (fictional narrative with characters illustrating a point)
- An apocalyptic vision (symbolic imagery in Revelation, Daniel)
- A typological narrative (historical event used as shadow/type)

Genre clarity scale: didactic > apocalyptic > parabolic.

**Gate 4 -- Harmony Gate.** Is the proposed classification consistent with all other E-items? If a conflict exists, apply SIS resolution -- the clearer passage governs the reading of the less clear.

### Reclassification After Gate Failure

When a gate fails, the corrected textual observation is formed by applying the gate's correction:

- Gate 1 fail: Restate with the actual (symbolic) subject
- Gate 2 fail: Restate using the grammatically valid alternative parsing
- Gate 3 fail: Restate as genre-appropriate reading
- Gate 4 fail: Restate incorporating the SIS resolution from the conflicting E-item

The corrected observation is re-entered into the vocabulary scan. The item remains in the Explicit table -- only its positional direction is updated.

---

## Scripture-Interprets-Scripture (SIS) Principle

Standard hermeneutics holds that clear passages interpret unclear ones. This series formally incorporates this principle:

**Criterion #4 splits into two:**

- **#4a** (SIS with verified textual connection) -- NOT an inference trigger. When a clear passage interprets an unclear one, and the connection is verified (shared vocabulary, OT quotation, tool-verified parallel score, or the text itself establishes the connection), this is standard hermeneutics, not an inference. Document the connection.
- **#4b** (cross-referencing without verified textual connection) -- IS an inference trigger. The reader must supply the connection. The link depends on the interpreter's judgment, not on the text itself.

### I-B Resolution Protocol

When an inference has competing textual support (I-B), this 5-step process is applied and documented in the CONCLUSION:

**Step 1: Identify tension.** List E/N items FOR and AGAINST the claim.

**Step 2: Assess clarity** of each E/N item:

- **Plain**: Directly addresses the topic using relevant vocabulary; no interpretation needed
- **Contextually Clear**: Addresses the topic but requires genre/audience/context awareness
- **Ambiguous**: Could plausibly be read either way

**Step 3: Count and weigh.** Plain statements outweigh Ambiguous ones (not a mere vote count).

**Step 4: Apply SIS.** Plain statements determine the reading of Ambiguous ones. The clear interprets the unclear.

**Step 5: State resolution:**

- **Strong** -- Plain statements on one side with only Ambiguous statements on the other
- **Moderate** -- Mix of Plain and Contextually Clear on the dominant side
- **Unresolved** -- Substantial Plain/Contextually Clear statements on both sides

**Clarity criteria** (what makes a passage "clearer"):

1. **Directness of vocabulary** -- actual words vs. figurative language
2. **Genre** -- didactic > apocalyptic > parabolic
3. **Scope** -- universal statement > specific situation
4. **Frequency** -- repeated across authors/testaments > single occurrence
5. **Self-interpretation** -- text explains its own meaning = maximally clear

---

## 5. Verification Phase

After completing all tables, a mandatory verification pass is run:

**Step A: Verify explicit statements.**
Does each E-statement directly quote or closely paraphrase actual verse text? Is it what the text *says* or what a position *infers* from it? If it's an inference, move it.

**Step A2: Verify positional classifications of E-items (mandatory).**
For each E-item classified as ECT or Conditionalist, run the full four-gate validation (Subject, Grammar, Genre, Harmony). Do not assign a positional direction without running all four gates.

**Step B: Verify necessary implications.**
Apply all three N-tier tests (universal agreement, no interpretation required, zero added concepts). Items that fail any test are moved to Inferences.

**Step C: Verify inference classifications (source test).**
Strip away the systematization. Are ALL remaining components found in the E/N tables? YES = text-derived. NO = external.

**Step D: Verify inference classifications (direction test).**
Does the claim require ANY E/N statement to mean something other than its lexical value? YES = conflicts. NO = aligns/compatible.

**Step E: Run consistency checks.**
Every I-A uses only criterion #5. Every I-B has E/N on BOTH sides. Every I-D overrides at least one E/N statement.

**Step F: Verify SIS connections.**
Every #4a connection is documented with shared vocabulary, OT quotation, or tool-verified parallel. Every #4b is properly treated as an inference trigger.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- Do NOT classify the plain meaning of words as inference. "Only" means only. "Became" means is. "Know not any thing" means lack knowledge.
- Do NOT classify observable textual patterns as inference. If Scripture uses term X for animals and humans, that's a fact you can observe.
- Do NOT classify unavoidable combinations as inference. If explicit statements A + B together yield C with no alternative, C is a necessary implication.
- The COUNTER-CLAIM to an explicit statement or necessary implication is often the real inference. If the text says "the dead know not any thing," the necessary implication is "the dead lack awareness." The inference is "these texts are limited to an earthly perspective" (applies a qualifier the text doesn't state).
- Do NOT classify what a text SAYS as supporting a position. Only classify by position when one side must DENY the textual observation. Otherwise classify as Neutral.

## 6. Master Evidence File

Before computing the tally, each study reads and updates `etc5-master-evidence.md`:

1. Read the master file to see all items registered by prior studies.
2. For each E/N/I item: if an item with the same verse + same observation already exists, note the master ID in CONCLUSION.md. If no match exists, add it with the next available ID.
3. Update the "Also In" field for any existing items the current study also cites.

This is the deduplication mechanism. Study 18 reads this file directly to produce the final deduplicated positional tally.

---

## 7. Tally Summary

Each study includes:

```
- Explicit statements: [count]
- Necessary implications: [count]
- Inferences: [count]
  - I-A (Evidence-Extending): [count]
  - I-B (Competing-Evidence): [count] ([N] resolved, [M] unresolved)
  - I-C (Compatible External): [count]
  - I-D (Counter-Evidence External): [count]
```

---

## 8. What CAN Be Said / What CANNOT Be Said

**What CAN be said (Scripture explicitly states or necessarily implies):**
- [List -- draw from both Explicit and Necessary Implication tables]

**What CANNOT be said (not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by Scripture):**
- [List of things neither side can claim the text directly states or necessarily implies -- including things commonly assumed by BOTH sides]

---

## Positional Tally (Study 18 Only)

The final synthesis study produces a deduplicated positional tally across all 18 studies. Two items are duplicates if they cite the same verse AND make the same observation. Items citing the same verse but making different observations are not duplicates.

Both raw and deduplicated counts are reported:

| Tier | Conditionalist | ECT | Neutral/Shared | Total |
|------|---------------|-----|----------------|-------|
| Explicit (E) | | | | |
| Necessary Implication (N) | | | | |
| I-A (Evidence-Extending) | | | | |
| I-B (Competing-Evidence) | | | | |
| I-C (Compatible External) | | | | |
| I-D (Counter-Evidence External) | | | | |
| **TOTAL** | | | | |

---

## Critical Rules Governing the Hierarchy

1. **E > N > I-A > I-B > I-C > I-D.** Higher-tier evidence governs the interpretation of lower-tier claims. An I-D claim cannot override an E statement.

2. **Inferences cannot block explicit statements or necessary implications.** If explicit texts and necessary implications establish X, the existence of passages that *could be inferred* to teach not-X does not prevent X from being established.

3. **I-A inferences are the strongest inferences** because they use only the text's own vocabulary and concepts. They are inferences only because they systematize.

4. **I-B inferences require the SIS protocol.** Both sides have textual support. The resolution must be documented. Plain passages interpret ambiguous ones.

5. **I-D inferences bear the heaviest burden.** They require overriding what the text says with concepts the text does not contain. They are valid only if the text itself provides reason to read against its surface meaning.

6. **SIS connections (#4a) are not inference triggers.** Using clear passages to interpret unclear ones -- when the connection is verified -- is standard hermeneutics. Only unverified cross-references (#4b) trigger inference classification.

---

## Conclusion Tone

Every study's conclusion:

- Presents the classification results as data
- States what the evidence tiers contain
- Does NOT use hedging language like "this doesn't prove X" or "this doesn't disprove Y"
- Does NOT editorialize about what the results mean for either position
- Lets the numbers and classifications speak for themselves

Example of what to write: "Across the verses examined, [N] explicit statements use destruction/death vocabulary for the fate of the wicked. [P] ECT claims are classified as I-D (counter-evidence external). [Q] conditionalist claims are classified as I-A (evidence-extending)."

Example of what NOT to write: "This does not prove ECT is wrong" or "This does not disprove conditionalism."

---

## No Editorial Opinion

- Do NOT characterize passages as being "in tension" with each other -- simply state what each passage says
- Do NOT call any argument "the strongest" or "the weakest" -- present the arguments and the evidence
- Do NOT use "genuinely ambiguous" -- state the possible readings and note which the text specifies or does not specify
- Do NOT say something "requires sustained effort to maintain" -- state the reasoning required and let the reader assess

---

## Cross-References to Other Studies

When a passage is examined in depth in another study in the series:

- Briefly state what the verse says (quote it)
- Add: *(Examined in depth in Study XX -- [title].)*
- Do NOT editorialize about the passage -- that's for the dedicated study
